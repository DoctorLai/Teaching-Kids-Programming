00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:09,059
I just noticed if you have a numbers

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:12,480
sorted the answer is the smallest number

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,360
how can you prove I don't know but it

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,359
looks like it right it looks like it

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:21,980
because look because you because you

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,980
because you always end

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,400
anything like

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,500
and the and the first number the

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,720
smallest number is at the beginning and

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,660
and that's where the minimum is going

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,899
minimum Max minimum Max and it starts at

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,219
the minimum so the most minimum goes

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,559
down that little bit most minimum

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,660
because it's always at the start so and

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,239
it always starts at minimum so it's

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,520
always obviously gonna pass and then

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,680
eventually eventually it's going to go

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,079
to minimum and then good job good job

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,680
excellent that's a weird Discovery yes

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,680
yes you're right
