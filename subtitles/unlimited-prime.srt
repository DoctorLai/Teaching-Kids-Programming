1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
why this endless thing is useful okay

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,720
just imagine you know that there are

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,639
unlimited number of prime numbers right

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,099
all right how to improve these are

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,040
unlimited look if the first number prime

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:18,300
number is P1 second prime number is P2

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,980
and prime number needs to be P3 if they

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,359
are limited number of prime numbers

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,160
let's say piano

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,500
up to pm

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,740
and how about if we times least together

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,840
that's limited I know I know I'm proving

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,880
that it's unlimited so let's assume the

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,579
opposite it's a limited and there are n

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,559
prime numbers P one p two P three up to

16
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:43,320
PN and that time Z together plus one

17
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,719
obviously this number is not divisible

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,480
by any of these right

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,300
am I right so this is also a prime

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,760
number we just assume there are n prime

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,579
numbers but now we found another one

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,320
so what does it mean the assumption is

23
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,480
wrong the Assumption what's the

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,940
Assumption there are n prime numbers

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,100
this assumption is wrong

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,680
okay so what does it mean it means we

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,240
have unlimited number of prime numbers

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,100
okay

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,860
okay so but you're saying B1 p2p3 but

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,960
you only have n two times together and

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,240
plus one that's right and this number is

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,040
the prime number yeah you only have an N

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,799
to multiply by

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,979
yes and that's limited because you only

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,960
have Ben yes and my assumption is that

36
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,600
okay let's assume that and prime numbers

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,119
yeah and then let us know this number

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,740
plus one comes together plus one is also

39
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,020
a prime number yeah that's only one more

40
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,259
one more okay so there's only one more

41
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,720
so it contracted it conflicts with the

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,640
assumption that only end actually n plus

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,380
one and I can keep doing this keep

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,220
adding this keep adding it so that means

45
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,259
that keeps adding okay I'm assuming

46
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,360
there are n prime numbers but now I

47
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,439
found another one which is not part of

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,780
this end

49
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,820
okay so I have one more number here

50
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,979
which is the prime number yeah but how

51
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,320
do you add another one

52
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,200
this is another one this is another one

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,680
yeah so you times that another one where

54
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,560
the other end yes so this this number

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
this number is a new prime number but

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,160
when you

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,160
in our first cry number times

58
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,459
number what about 21 free look look two

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,800
times three it equals six plus one

60
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,739
equals seven you missed a five

61
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,260
that's okay okay so let's assume that

62
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,300
only two point numbers right let's

63
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,580
assume okay we want to prove there are

64
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,620
only two that they are Limited Brand

65
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,300
number which is two and three now I'm

66
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,519
telling you two times three plus one

67
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,400
this is obviously a prime number

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,260
seven and then two times three times

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,879
seven okay so we found another prime

70
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,580
number which is seven

71
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,620
so the original assumption is wrong they

72
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,319
are not just two prime number because

73
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,260
seven is another prime number

74
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,120
my origin assumptions they are only n

75
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,400
prime numbers now I found another one

76
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,400
number which is point number so it's

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,280
contracted the original assumption

78
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,680
so the origin assumption is wrong

79
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,180
the opposite is correct which is there

80
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,180
are unlimited number of prime numbers
