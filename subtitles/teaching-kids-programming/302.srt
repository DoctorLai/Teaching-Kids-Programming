1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,360
uh

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,839
hello mr harry are you ready

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,680
yes okay so remember

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,400
we talked about how to calculate the sum

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,519
between one to n right right

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,920
one plus two plus three plus four plus

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,760
q10 what's the

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:22,320
answer so n this time 55

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,240
sum okay so it's equals to

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,800
i equals 1 to n yes this is the sum yeah

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
and then what

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,600
i okay so this is a mathematics symbol

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,440
how do you calculate why is it 55

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,960
is it 51 yeah

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,920
how do it calculate it's 55 1 and 10 and

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,239
11

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,239
yeah

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,840
okay

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,239
so in general if it's it's one plus two

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,000
plus three plus here

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,520
n what's the answer what's the equation

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,239
for that do you still remember it's okay

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,239
you don't remember

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,479
what's this what's the if f n is the sum

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,360
of these so what's happening

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,840
what's it do you still remember

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,560
how do you generalize this you know this

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,240
is one plus ten

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,479
times five pairs how how do you get a

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,479
five

31
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,720
okay so i think it's n plus the first

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,439
one divided by two

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,640
times n divided by two okay

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,000
yeah

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,920
first first item and last item

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,079
how many items are then divided by two

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,720
okay so we don't have to start with one

38
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,479
right so look if we start with

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,280
we if five plus six plus seven plus here

40
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,280
and what's the answer

41
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,600
this one this one yeah

42
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,520
you wanna come in okay okay

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
okay

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,560
so look it's first item plus last item

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,280
times how many items are there right so

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
n plus y and times how many items are

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,920
they

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,760
yeah divided by two yeah yes yeah okay

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,760
so what what's this m plus y

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,720
times how many uh items n minus y plus

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
one

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,080
divided by two okay

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,480
so in general this is uh

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,800
like any integers sum right i was

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,720
talking 1 plus 2 plus 3 any numbers yeah

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,680
1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 2

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,519
plus n is the answer is

58
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,360
the first item plus the last item

59
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,760
comes how many items are left divided by

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
two okay

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,560
another easy way another easy way

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,280
another easy way look look

63
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,360
yes 1

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,200
plus 2

65
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,680
plus 3

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,519
plus 4

67
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,480
okay so

68
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,640
1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,480
equals how many i can do this look how

70
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,879
about if i feel this look

71
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,879
i feel this with the cross all right

72
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
look this is the magic

73
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,840
i feel it

74
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,480
i feel it

75
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,879
and i feel one more

76
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,879
okay so so what do you notice

77
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,840
so these these

78
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,920
circles are equal to the how many

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,640
circles are equal how many colors like

80
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,840
and how many of them are together

81
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,200
this is n

82
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,519
this is n

83
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,680
this is n this is n plus one right

84
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,760
because we feel like one right so it's n

85
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,000
times n plus one

86
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,599
divided by two got it

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,680
yeah

88
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,519
ryan do you understand this yes i need

89
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,319
to understand it

90
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,560
this is how we prove we prove that

91
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,640
we prove what one plus two plus three

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,280
plus tier and

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,360
uh the sum is is this

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,480
okay so now today's question okay let's

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,239
coming up today's question

96
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,480
all right

97
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,760
so let's feel the

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,040
stairs let's build this if we have uh

99
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,040
n circus okay maybe coins okay we have n

100
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,000
coins yeah these are coins right all

101
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,600
right

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,079
these are coins we have n coins

103
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,880
and we want to put the n coins near the

104
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,199
stairs of points like the first one

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,520
first of one coin

106
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,479
second two coins third three coins and

107
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
so on

108
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,040
so if they are ten coins this is ten

109
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,720
points you need to tell me we can build

110
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,440
four

111
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,880
okay first four stairs

112
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,199
but if i i'm i only have nine right all

113
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,960
right look i only have nine

114
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,800
so you need to tell me i can only be a

115
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,600
three four

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,639
first stairs okay

117
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,800
make sense

118
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,479
how about 15

119
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,600
how many how many stairs can we get

120
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,080
fifteen

121
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,080
five five five and how about fourteen

122
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,759
four four yeah

123
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,840
yeah good job good job okay so what's

124
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,320
your song

125
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,840
this is basically the other way yeah you

126
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,440
just go down and just find the

127
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,039
idea you understand the problem we're

128
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,280
talking about

129
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,280
so previously we we

130
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,360
know the end we can calculate this sound

131
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,720
that's easy right but now we know this

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,720
um we want to get go back

133
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,560
and then you want to get and then you

134
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
want to

135
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,199
accumulate until you reach

136
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,840
that right yeah that's one solution yeah

137
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,479
look let's

138
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,160
translate

139
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,520
that's one solution yeah we're done

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,759
let's let's call it simulation and we

141
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,520
we simulate the process how we build it

142
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,360
yeah so look i'm just writing the

143
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520
pseudocode yeah okay look

144
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,520
uh let's say the answer at the beginning

145
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,120
we have a zero right and we have n right

146
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,479
we haven't so let's say we have uh

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,720
okay maybe

148
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,680
this this is the row rows equals zero

149
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
okay

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,840
right

151
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
yeah

152
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
and then i let's say i equals the first

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
one

154
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,759
so wire

155
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,759
i

156
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:20,400
this this this is the coins we are uh

157
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,759
maybe we name it as current okay current

158
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,319
row current low equals one okay

159
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,440
one is here

160
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,639
so look

161
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,479
why uh why we have coins why we have

162
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,560
coins

163
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,240
covering row okay camera why we have

164
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,080
coins why n is bigger than the

165
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,400
bigger or equal than one then the

166
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,960
current row

167
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,319
right now we need to do what rows we can

168
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,039
fill this row plus equals one right and

169
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,319
then we need to subtract n equals

170
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,360
current right now the current equals the

171
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,120
next row is what plus equals

172
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,080
one right

173
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,880
look

174
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,400
is it another turn rows like this is the

175
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,440
unknown one

176
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,280
yeah okay let's see this is simulation

177
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,039
can we we want to determine the number

178
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,599
of rows we can feel right

179
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,479
and this is the current number of

180
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,759
current of current coins we have to put

181
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,479
in the current node

182
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,160
the first one is first uh first row is

183
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,960
first coin one coin

184
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
one

185
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,759
and

186
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,039
when we have coins

187
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,240
and when we

188
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,400
have enough coins for carbon row ro

189
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,840
yeah then we can complete one more row

190
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
right and then we

191
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,560
subtract

192
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,520
the coins from the row so from the total

193
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
coins

194
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,440
right i know it's

195
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,840
what's the next

196
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,280
how many coins for the next row is

197
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,840
current plus equal one and with the

198
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,319
generals so this is the simulation okay

199
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:57,440
so if n is very big yeah this is getting

200
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,759
the time complexity uh is getting rough

201
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,680
how how do you calculate bigger

202
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,720
yeah it's getting bigger

203
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,479
no no not really look how many times how

204
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,680
uh how many iterations do you think you

205
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,800
would you will become anywhere become

206
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
less than

207
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
learn the current

208
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,160
how many iterations actually we can

209
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,360
prove it right look we can prove it we

210
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,319
can prove it look

211
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,199
look

212
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,400
we we know right we know n times n plus

213
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,840
one right divided by two right it needs

214
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,839
to be

215
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,000
it needs to be smaller or equals than uh

216
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,399
actually let's not call it n let's call

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,039
it the row okay let's call it

218
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,800
ah okay and resort reserve

219
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,200
ah are rows

220
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,680
this is the number of coins if we can

221
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,360
build our stairs that should be less

222
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,480
than or equal than n right

223
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,560
right

224
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,480
so what's this okay let's write it

225
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,480
what's this what's this

226
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,000
evil times multiply two by two sides so

227
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,800
r times r plus one

228
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,839
small or equal to one right correct

229
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,880
yeah from here i multiply two both sides

230
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,800
and the equation still stands okay

231
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,800
what's this remember remember

232
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,040
what we talked about is a plus b squared

233
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,880
can you tell me what it is

234
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,399
a squared

235
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,480
plus

236
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,279
b squared plus

237
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,880
c

238
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,600
nice new c come on

239
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,880
how many look hey yes two times a b okay

240
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,920
yeah

241
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,839
at least

242
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,000
remember this is very important

243
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,360
yeah okay so now look

244
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
r times

245
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,000
this is this is what

246
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,440
r square plus r right plus one

247
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,839
plus one

248
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,760
if i plus two

249
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,240
uh if i trust for

250
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,480
if i add a quarter here right

251
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,920
and i need to subtract a quarter on the

252
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,720
right hand side right

253
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,720
i need to press

254
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,839
the other side right

255
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,839
yes

256
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,680
okay so let's see

257
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:15,760
r plus two a quarter and a half square

258
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,480
look r square plus a quarter

259
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,040
plus two times this right is smaller or

260
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,240
equal to n plus four a quarter one over

261
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,480
four

262
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,560
okay so if we get a square root of both

263
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,480
sides

264
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,360
if we get the square root of both sides

265
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,279
look okay can you yeah this is the this

266
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,040
is how we deduce it

267
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,040
so look r plus equal uh half

268
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,440
smaller or equal you know because r is

269
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,360
positive right if i is positive so

270
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,600
that's why we can square root on both

271
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,519
sides right so that's 2n plus

272
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,160
a quarter

273
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,640
and then i you know i move this to the

274
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,440
right hand side subtract half

275
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,279
okay so r is smaller or equal than this

276
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,839
and we want the integer part we wanted

277
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,200
the floor look this this symbol look

278
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,959
what's this

279
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
what's this no

280
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,560
flaw you know the floor fancy

281
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,959
yes like if it's you just round it

282
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,959
four thirty point five is one four three

283
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,179
[Music]

284
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,600
yes the ceiling is this

285
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
this is ceiling look it's quite

286
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
quite visually

287
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,399
yeah this is from this ceiling

288
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,399
yeah floor is the largest integer less

289
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,040
less than current number

290
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,079
we see ceiling is the smallest number

291
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,680
which is bigger than 3.5 yeah

292
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,839
yeah okay so we want the list so ah is

293
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,040
this so the current complexity of that

294
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,120
simulation

295
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,480
is this o

296
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,160
right okay

297
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,399
so nothing no no

298
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,639
if you do the simulation right like like

299
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,920
remember the previous one why

300
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,680
why the

301
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,000
we have enough points for the current

302
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,399
role yeah we subtract the coins from the

303
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,040
current uh from the total coins we

304
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,440
increment the coins for the next row

305
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,760
and we we increment the number of rows

306
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,000
we need we can build right let something

307
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,720
like this easy but if i

308
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,160
look if i implement this function i can

309
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,560
just return

310
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,839
you know return two times n plus a

311
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,959
quarter

312
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,560
square root

313
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,800
minus

314
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,600
half what's the time the mass if i just

315
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,600
take a little speed

316
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,100
if i take your list what's the time

317
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:44,039
conversity

318
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:44,039
[Music]

319
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,880
expression it's all it's usually i would

320
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,160
say it's usually oh i don't know

321
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,000
if we

322
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,399
don't consider if you if you don't

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,760
consider the term complexity calculus

324
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,839
square root so it's one okay

325
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,959
so yes this is the most perfect but we

326
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,279
can also finally search it yeah yeah you

327
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,720
see the final research

328
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,120
okay i'm going to write the binary

329
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,060
search and you'll tell me

330
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,720
you're not a financial white spanish

[Music]

332
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,160
look this is a one to n and i want to

333
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,000
find the number between it and if if i

334
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,480
can have a function to tell me like if

335
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,279
it's bigger or smaller so every time i

336
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,360
can

337
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,839
i can narrow down the search search

338
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,160
space by half right

339
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,959
it's it's like okay so how do you

340
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,279
explain the minor research eric right

341
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,279
any of you can tell that it was final

342
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,279

[Music]

344
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,279
yeah so look

345
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,880
one to a hundred i have a number between

346
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,680
one two hundred you guess

347
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,880
yeah

348
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,560
yeah can you guess 50 25 no no no no

349
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,480
okay you guess

350
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,600
i tell you if it's bigger

351
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,040
so i have a number in mind can you guess

352
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,320
50

353
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,160
it's uh

354
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,959
it's bigger than i the number i thought

355
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,199
75 it's bigger than the number i thought

356
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,199
okay

357
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,040
look you say you asked you said 50. i

358
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,079
said

359
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,360
i said 50 is more than the number i saw

360
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,440
the one

361
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,040
okay it's smaller than another

362
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,240
then i'll go for

363
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,160
48

364
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,079
yeah okay you know the game yeah so

365
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,320
every time you cut in half right so your

366
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,320
search space is nine without every time

367
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,720
you cut in half cut in half cutting

368
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,120
popcorn so that the time connection of

369
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
minor issues is usually usually locked

370
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,720
logan right we'll talk about this in the

371
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,000
very first video

372
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,440
okay so now

373
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,360
let's let's say

374
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,639
let's say look we want to feel

375
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,360
that coin yeah look yeah look at this

376
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,959
let's say the first one and the end roll

377
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,560
right but we are not sure how many rows

378
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,279
we can build right

379
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,480
the

380
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,560
arrow okay

381
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,600
they are totally end coin right

382
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,480
but

383
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,480
look if i i'm guessing if i'm guessing i

384
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,360
can feel

385
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,680
uh three rows so i know how many coins i

386
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,800
like i need to build a three row right

387
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,720
yeah because we just know right n times

388
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,440
n plus one divided by two this is the

389
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,000
number of coins we need to build the n

390
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,160
rows right yeah so depending on this we

391
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,199
can half in the the

392
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,680
search uh search space okay

393
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,040
yeah

394
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,839
[Music]

395
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,240
define okay

396
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,560
beard stairs

397
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,800
of coins

398
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,920
i know we have end coins right

399
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,519
so the beginning left let's say left

400
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,120
equal left

401
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,880
left right left

402
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,680
the minimum we can build is one row

403
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,480
right

404
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,279
yeah

405
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,240
yeah

406
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,639
if n is positive then one yeah if n

407
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,240
n is bigger or bigger than zero okay if

408
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,880
it's zero like obviously we compare

409
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,800
anything right if n is bigger than one

410
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,959
bigger or equal than one

411
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,240
the minimum we can build is one row

412
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:17,360
right the maximum is one

413
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,600
r rows we can put it i n row right yeah

414
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,240
okay so wire

415
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,120
left is smaller than equal than r right

416
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,279
okay

417
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,320
what's the meter meter what's how do we

418
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,560
cut the middle if left is

419
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
look

420
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,360
what's the middle

421
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,360
left

422
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,279
right and anybody

423
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,240
left the right what's the middle

424
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,839
um

425
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,920
right divided

426
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,800
okay divided by two you can do this all

427
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,839
you can shift it by one yeah look at 50

428
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,839
50 by one this is also okay right look

429
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,440
50 you don't need to put a bracket

430
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:57,040
because the plus takes priority over the

431
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,399
15 so it's the same as this okay so 60

432
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,560
and then now how many coins we need

433
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,400
how many coins we need to build the n

434
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,679
rows how many coins we need to build

435
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,360
them

436
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,880
how many coins we need to build and

437
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,130
wrong huh

438
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,319
how many coins we need to build

439
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,319
[Music]

440
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,039
n times

441
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,839
m plus 1

442
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,760
divided by 2 2. this is the formula yeah

443
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,640
we just talked about right

444
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,640
okay

445
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,880
if k equal equals n

446
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,559
so what does this mean we can bear the n

447
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,240
rows right

448
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,000
this is the coins we need and this is

449
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,720
the coins we have

450
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,280
yeah then return return one

451
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,280
reason why

452
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,960
[Music]

453
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,960
what's the what's the law

454
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,760
mid m okay if k is smaller than n

455
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,520
we don't have another coin so we look we

456
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,960
don't have enough coins so we need to

457
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,880
increment the row or we need to

458
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,679
decrement a row come on

459
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,559
if we don't have enough coins

460
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,799
plus

461
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,080
we need to increment so not plus so we

462
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,960
need to do what mid

463
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,320
left

464
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
equals one

465
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,840
mid

466
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,840
last one right

467
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,679
yes we have enough coins we need to

468
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,919
reduce them right right equals one

469
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,200
minus one we are done and then we need

470
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,720
to return

471
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,720
return this is a big chicken little

472
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,480
return air minus one right because it's

473
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,880
already power minus one or return ah

474
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,440
yeah return r all return

475
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,320
left to minus one all right yeah left

476
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,840
minus one look because the l eventually

477
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,559
you'll be unplugged when we need to

478
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,440
subtract one ah it's okay right

479
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,470
okay yes nice and what's the time

480
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,989
compression of this one come on

[Music]

483
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,600
so we talk about three solutions okay

484
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,240
let's review a little bit the first one

485
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,760
is simulation yeah

486
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,760
we we start to

487
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,240
to simulate by putting the first coin

488
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,400
from the first row second row third row

489
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,280
and so on that time connecting we

490
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,679
is

491
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,039
that formula right because

492
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,799
the formula

493
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,160
o 1

494
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,640
square root

495
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,440
2 n plus

496
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,600
x comes from a quarter n minus

497
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,679
half right something like that yeah

498
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,760
this is the time the second solution is

499
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,320
mathematic yeah we just if we just

500
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,840
evaluate calculate this formula which is

501
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,720
one right

502
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,720
yeah

503
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,679
the third solution binary search which

504
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,760
is o all logan right

505
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,000
makes sense

506
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,080
makes sense

507
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,600
okay makes sense

508
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,559
what okay what's the formula of

509
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,559
calculating the first and integer i

510
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,720
equals 1 to n

511
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,559
sum of i what's this what's this what's

512
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,960
the sum of these
