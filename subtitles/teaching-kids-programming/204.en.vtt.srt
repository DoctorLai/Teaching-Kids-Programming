00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,470

hello hello mr mr ryan how are you today

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:04,480
hello hello mr mr ryan how are you today
 

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,030
hello hello mr mr ryan how are you today
today's friday yeah okay so remember a

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,040
today's friday yeah okay so remember a
 

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,230
today's friday yeah okay so remember a
few while ago

6
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
few while ago
 

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,190
few while ago
we talked about max maximum product of

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
we talked about max maximum product of
 

9
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,990
we talked about max maximum product of
three numbers yeah given uh

10
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
three numbers yeah given uh
 

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,750
three numbers yeah given uh
any number like two minus three five

12
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:17,760
any number like two minus three five
 

13
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,269
any number like two minus three five
six one zero and you want to find the

14
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:21,279
six one zero and you want to find the
 

15
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,429
six one zero and you want to find the
next product of three numbers yeah

16
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
next product of three numbers yeah
 

17
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,349
next product of three numbers yeah
what's our approach to do that

18
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359

 

19
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,269

do you still remember still remember

20
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
do you still remember still remember
 

21
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,709
do you still remember still remember
no two points salty yes we salted and

22
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
no two points salty yes we salted and
 

23
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,990
no two points salty yes we salted and
then what

24
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
then what
 

25
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,150
then what
if we salted this will become minus

26
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
if we salted this will become minus
 

27
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,510
if we salted this will become minus
three

28
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
three
 

29
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,709
three
zero one two five six

30
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
zero one two five six
 

31
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,950
zero one two five six
okay so what's the next three numbers

32
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
okay so what's the next three numbers
 

33
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,910
okay so what's the next three numbers
you can pick

34
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
you can pick
 

35
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,190
you can pick
to get the maximum three five six yeah

36
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
to get the maximum three five six yeah
 

37
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,869
to get the maximum three five six yeah
and how do you totally check it

38
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
and how do you totally check it
 

39
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,910
and how do you totally check it
is the negative numbers so they

40
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
is the negative numbers so they
 

41
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,750
is the negative numbers so they
we want to check the maximum three

42
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
we want to check the maximum three
 

43
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,029
we want to check the maximum three
numbers and

44
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
numbers and
 

45
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,229
numbers and
all the maximum the the maximum

46
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
all the maximum the the maximum
 

47
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,390
all the maximum the the maximum
and then two numbers if there's a one

48
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
and then two numbers if there's a one
 

49
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,670
and then two numbers if there's a one
minus a hundred here

50
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
minus a hundred here
 

51
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,910
minus a hundred here
so what's the maximum three numbers you

52
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
so what's the maximum three numbers you
 

53
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,750
so what's the maximum three numbers you
can get

54
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
can get
 

55
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,580
can get
make kanji

56
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:14,590

 

57
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,030

[Music]

58
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
[Music]
 

59
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,030
[Music]
that's right yes so you pick these two

60
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
that's right yes so you pick these two
 

61
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,149
that's right yes so you pick these two
at the maximum

62
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
at the maximum
 

63
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,670
at the maximum
so in in short term if in short term we

64
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
so in in short term if in short term we
 

65
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,950
so in in short term if in short term we
also saw these numbers

66
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
also saw these numbers
 

67
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,590
also saw these numbers
and then we find we find we compute the

68
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
and then we find we find we compute the
 

69
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,190
and then we find we find we compute the
product the multiple

70
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
product the multiple
 

71
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,710
product the multiple
of the next three numbers or the

72
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
of the next three numbers or the
 

73
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,910
of the next three numbers or the
minimum two numbers we and the maximum

74
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
minimum two numbers we and the maximum
 

75
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,950
minimum two numbers we and the maximum
right yeah we need to pick okay so

76
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
right yeah we need to pick okay so
 

77
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,429
right yeah we need to pick okay so
about today is the simplified version we

78
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
about today is the simplified version we
 

79
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,550
about today is the simplified version we
want to find out

80
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
want to find out
 

81
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,630
want to find out
the next product of two numbers just

82
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
the next product of two numbers just
 

83
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,069
the next product of two numbers just
pick two numbers

84
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
pick two numbers
 

85
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,389
pick two numbers
that would be easy so what's that

86
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
that would be easy so what's that
 

87
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,310
that would be easy so what's that
so if you want to pick two products and

88
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
so if you want to pick two products and
 

89
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,590
so if you want to pick two products and
then

90
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
then
 

91
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,350
then
to find out the maximum product can you

92
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
to find out the maximum product can you
 

93
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,830
to find out the maximum product can you
tell me how how do we do this

94
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
tell me how how do we do this
 

95
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,870
tell me how how do we do this
these two equals your times together is

96
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
these two equals your times together is
 

97
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,469
these two equals your times together is
300

98
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
300
 

99
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,830
300
oh okay okay so what's your approach

100
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
oh okay okay so what's your approach
 

101
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,589
oh okay okay so what's your approach
first we check if there are even

102
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
first we check if there are even
 

103
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,270
first we check if there are even
numbers we do we need to add actually

104
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
numbers we do we need to add actually
 

105
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,229
numbers we do we need to add actually
if it's if it's bigger than one sorry

106
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
if it's if it's bigger than one sorry
 

107
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,350
if it's if it's bigger than one sorry
what's the picking one

108
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
what's the picking one
 

109
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,790
what's the picking one
right if there's more than one negative

110
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
right if there's more than one negative
 

111
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,550
right if there's more than one negative
okay yeah and we don't need to actually

112
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
okay yeah and we don't need to actually
 

113
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,070
okay yeah and we don't need to actually
check we just need to compare

114
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
check we just need to compare
 

115
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,430
check we just need to compare
two cases the next two numbers

116
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
two cases the next two numbers
 

117
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,910
two cases the next two numbers
and a negative one a negative one

118
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
and a negative one a negative one
 

119
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,430
and a negative one a negative one
negative

120
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
negative
 

121
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,430
negative
negative which how many numbers we need

122
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
negative which how many numbers we need
 

123
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,550
negative which how many numbers we need
to check negative

124
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560

 

125
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,030

uh two yeah we want to check the

126
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
uh two yeah we want to check the
 

127
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,070
uh two yeah we want to check the
negative two numbers

128
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
negative two numbers
 

129
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,390
negative two numbers
and if they and we want to find out the

130
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
and if they and we want to find out the
 

131
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,270
and if they and we want to find out the
maximum

132
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
maximum
 

133
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,390
maximum
of these two right yeah a little bit uh

134
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
of these two right yeah a little bit uh
 

135
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,790
of these two right yeah a little bit uh
what's the time complexity

136
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
what's the time complexity
 

137
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,030
what's the time complexity
yeah yeah what's the term complexity

138
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
yeah yeah what's the term complexity
 

139
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,149
yeah yeah what's the term complexity
what if i would

140
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
what if i would
 

141
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,710
what if i would
end again yeah because we need to start

142
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
end again yeah because we need to start
 

143
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,949
end again yeah because we need to start
starting yes we're

144
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
starting yes we're
 

145
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,309
starting yes we're
like done and what would you

146
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
like done and what would you
 

147
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,550
like done and what would you
it's 300 it's the maximum for that you

148
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
it's 300 it's the maximum for that you
 

149
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,470
it's 300 it's the maximum for that you
can pick this one on that one yeah

150
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
can pick this one on that one yeah
 

151
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,589
can pick this one on that one yeah
okay so for to do this we need to solve

152
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
okay so for to do this we need to solve
 

153
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,070
okay so for to do this we need to solve
this

154
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
this
 

155
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,270
this
and then we find out all right yeah okay

156
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
and then we find out all right yeah okay
 

157
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,390
and then we find out all right yeah okay
let's do this

158
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400

 

159
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,750

define max

160
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
define max
 

161
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:42,390
define max
product of two right and then numbs

162
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400

 

163
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,470

and then we need to return the maximum

164
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
and then we need to return the maximum
 

165
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,350
and then we need to return the maximum
of what the nums

166
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
of what the nums
 

167
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,830
of what the nums
sorted will be slower to the maximum so

168
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
sorted will be slower to the maximum so
 

169
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,910
sorted will be slower to the maximum so
numbers can you tell me

170
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920

 

171
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,869

this is the smallest number right time

172
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
this is the smallest number right time
 

173
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,910
this is the smallest number right time
times

174
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920

 

175
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,990

what one yeah and

176
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
what one yeah and
 

177
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,429
what one yeah and
between nouns the

178
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
between nouns the
 

179
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,749
between nouns the
the biggest number which is one

180
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
the biggest number which is one
 

181
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,110
the biggest number which is one
the biggest number on the right hand

182
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
the biggest number on the right hand
 

183
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,110
the biggest number on the right hand
side if we sort it zero one two

184
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
side if we sort it zero one two
 

185
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,830
side if we sort it zero one two
three four this minus one yeah numbers

186
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
three four this minus one yeah numbers
 

187
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,110
three four this minus one yeah numbers
minus one times one

188
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120

 

189
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,510

this is zero this is one and you're

190
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
this is zero this is one and you're
 

191
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,270
this is zero this is one and you're
saying this is minus one

192
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
saying this is minus one
 

193
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,680
saying this is minus one
and this is what

194
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:39,690
and this is what
 

195
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,030
and this is what

smallest this is the
 

201
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,030
smallest this is the
second smaller this is minus one is the

202
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
second smaller this is minus one is the
 

203
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,390
second smaller this is minus one is the
largest and second larger what's this

204
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
largest and second larger what's this
 

205
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,310
largest and second larger what's this
no no there could be any numbers here

206
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
no no there could be any numbers here
 

207
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,230
no no there could be any numbers here
minus one this is syntax minus one

208
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
minus one this is syntax minus one
 

209
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,590

what's this

210
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
what's this
 

211
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,790
what's this
minus dot what minus two comma i just

212
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
minus dot what minus two comma i just
 

213

said two
 

215
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,430
said two
it's minus two okay half right you're

216
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
it's minus two okay half right you're
 

217
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,670
it's minus two okay half right you're
fifty percent right okay

218
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
fifty percent right okay
 

219
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:20,710
fifty percent right okay
okay uh

220
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720

 

221
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,990

so why are we starting here why are we

222
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
so why are we starting here why are we
 

223
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,469
so why are we starting here why are we
starting here

224
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
starting here
 

225
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,670
starting here
oh because we want to get very big

226
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
oh because we want to get very big
 

227
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,909
oh because we want to get very big
we want to get the two biggest and the

228
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
we want to get the two biggest and the
 

229
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,749
we want to get the two biggest and the
two smallest right

230
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
two smallest right
 

231
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,870
two smallest right
yeah all right if we know

232
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
yeah all right if we know
 

233
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,310
yeah all right if we know
the biggest the most largest two and the

234
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
the biggest the most largest two and the
 

235
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,510
the biggest the most largest two and the
most smallest two do we need to solve

236
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
most smallest two do we need to solve
 

237
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,510
most smallest two do we need to solve
yeah we just need to find out the two

238
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
yeah we just need to find out the two
 

239
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,749
yeah we just need to find out the two
largest and two smallest right

240
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
largest and two smallest right
 

241
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,029
largest and two smallest right
all right yeah can we do that look

242
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
all right yeah can we do that look
 

243
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,230
all right yeah can we do that look
look if we do this this is the number

244
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
look if we do this this is the number
 

245
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,309
look if we do this this is the number
yeah

246
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:56,319
yeah
 

247
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,070
yeah
0 minus 5

248
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
0 minus 5
 

249
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,309
0 minus 5
6 2 1

250
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319

 

251
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,110

minus 100 okay for the for example we

252
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
minus 100 okay for the for example we
 

253
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,189
minus 100 okay for the for example we
want to find out the maximum two numbers

254
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
want to find out the maximum two numbers
 

255
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,070
want to find out the maximum two numbers
yeah just just just uh maximum two

256
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
yeah just just just uh maximum two
 

257
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,629
yeah just just just uh maximum two
number let's say the maximum

258
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
number let's say the maximum
 

259
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,749
number let's say the maximum
the the biggest number one okay let's

260
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
the the biggest number one okay let's
 

261
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,830
the the biggest number one okay let's
say the biggest

262
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
say the biggest
 

263
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,070
say the biggest
biggest okay and then

264
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
biggest okay and then
 

265
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,590
biggest okay and then
the second biggest yeah right

266
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600

 

267
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,670

i know biggest and second biggest

268
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
i know biggest and second biggest
 

269
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,110
i know biggest and second biggest
initially you would be

270
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
initially you would be
 

271
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,390
initially you would be
equals minus negative infinity yeah

272
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
equals minus negative infinity yeah
 

273
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,749
equals minus negative infinity yeah
yeah so because i want to keep it there

274
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759

 

275
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,950

okay now i go through this okay i don't

276
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
okay now i go through this okay i don't
 

277
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,430
okay now i go through this okay i don't
need to sort it

278
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
need to sort it
 

279
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,629
need to sort it
is 0 is 0

280
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
is 0 is 0
 

281
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,270
is 0 is 0
bigger than the biggest now

282
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280

 

283
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,790

yeah this is the initial value yeah yeah

284
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
yeah this is the initial value yeah yeah
 

285
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,629
yeah this is the initial value yeah yeah
all right so if it's bigger than that

286
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
all right so if it's bigger than that
 

287
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,270
all right so if it's bigger than that
first of all

288
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280

 

289
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,830

if it's bigger than that then i set it

290
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
if it's bigger than that then i set it
 

291
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,990
if it's bigger than that then i set it
to zero

292
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
to zero
 

293
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,950
to zero
no no no not yet not if i send it to the

294
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
no no no not yet not if i send it to the
 

295
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,230
no no no not yet not if i send it to the
piggies

296
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
piggies
 

297
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,390
piggies
right so what happened to the second

298
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
right so what happened to the second
 

299
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,270
right so what happened to the second
biggest

300
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280

 

301
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,469

it would have to be smoother

302
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
it would have to be smoother
 

303
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,589
it would have to be smoother
look for example if current begins is

304
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
look for example if current begins is
 

305
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,430
look for example if current begins is
nine and seven okay yeah yeah

306
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
nine and seven okay yeah yeah
 

307
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,110
nine and seven okay yeah yeah
this is the biggies and then this is

308
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
this is the biggies and then this is
 

309
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,029
this is the biggies and then this is
second piece if i have a card number

310
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
second piece if i have a card number
 

311
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,990
second piece if i have a card number
which is 10

312
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
which is 10
 

313
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,710
which is 10
so what's the biggest 10 what's the

314
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
so what's the biggest 10 what's the
 

315
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,150
so what's the biggest 10 what's the
second biggest

316
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
second biggest
 

317
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,430
second biggest
yeah so here we have a new one

318
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
yeah so here we have a new one
 

319
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,909
yeah so here we have a new one
the biggest will be the second biggest

320
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
the biggest will be the second biggest
 

321
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,629
the biggest will be the second biggest
ever

322
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
ever
 

323
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,909
ever
and the new one will be the biggest yeah

324
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
and the new one will be the biggest yeah
 

325
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,790
and the new one will be the biggest yeah
it kind of yeah

326
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
it kind of yeah
 

327
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,510
it kind of yeah
you're right yes so look look then first

328
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
you're right yes so look look then first
 

329
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,309
you're right yes so look look then first
of all we need to replace the

330
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
of all we need to replace the
 

331
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,710
of all we need to replace the
we need to save the second biggest now

332
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
we need to save the second biggest now
 

333
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,990
we need to save the second biggest now
right because it will be the second

334
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
right because it will be the second
 

335
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,670
right because it will be the second
biggest all right this will become

336
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
biggest all right this will become
 

337
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,350
biggest all right this will become
second bit and you raise this

338
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
second bit and you raise this
 

339
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,469
second bit and you raise this
right nine and then i put the 10 here

340
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
right nine and then i put the 10 here
 

341
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,270
right nine and then i put the 10 here
it's the same yeah got it okay another

342
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
it's the same yeah got it okay another
 

343
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,230
it's the same yeah got it okay another
another case is

344
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
another case is
 

345
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,430
another case is
another cases uh

346
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
another cases uh
 

347
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,390
another cases uh
if it's seven and if it's ten here right

348
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
if it's seven and if it's ten here right
 

349
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,749
if it's seven and if it's ten here right
the biggest second bit

350
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
the biggest second bit
 

351
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,550
the biggest second bit
if a comes in will happen

352
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560

 

353
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,430

yeah so you need to rip because it's

354
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
yeah so you need to rip because it's
 

355
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,040
yeah so you need to rip because it's
bigger than my biggest no no

356
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,050
bigger than my biggest no no
 

357
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:33,029
bigger than my biggest no no
[Music]

358
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
[Music]
 

359
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,269
[Music]
yeah you got it yeah so if we close the

360
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
yeah you got it yeah so if we close the
 

361
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,070
yeah you got it yeah so if we close the
left follow this strategy

362
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
left follow this strategy
 

363
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,750
left follow this strategy
we can get the biggest and second

364
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
we can get the biggest and second
 

365
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,389
we can get the biggest and second
biggest right yeah so

366
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
biggest right yeah so
 

367
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,550
biggest right yeah so
and the same thing the smallest and the

368
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
and the same thing the smallest and the
 

369
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,590
and the same thing the smallest and the
second smallest

370
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
second smallest
 

371
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,630
second smallest
all right yeah so if we keep

372
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
all right yeah so if we keep
 

373
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,949
all right yeah so if we keep
four variables and following this

374
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
four variables and following this
 

375
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,389
four variables and following this
strategy

376
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
strategy
 

377
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,310
strategy
then the time complexity is one

378
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320

 

379
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,389

we're down away yeah good job right

380
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
we're down away yeah good job right
 

381
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,310
we're down away yeah good job right
right you're listening yeah good job

382
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
right you're listening yeah good job
 

383
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,190
right you're listening yeah good job
oh and because we just go into once yeah

384
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
oh and because we just go into once yeah
 

385
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,190
oh and because we just go into once yeah
according to once i'm right

386
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
according to once i'm right
 

387
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,910
according to once i'm right
okay oh n okay so it's which one is

388
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
okay oh n okay so it's which one is
 

389
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,550
okay oh n okay so it's which one is
faster

390
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
faster
 

391
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,030
faster
can you tell me this one why is that

392
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
can you tell me this one why is that
 

393
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,949
can you tell me this one why is that
because

394
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
because
 

395
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,509
because
and the other one the first one is what

396
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
and the other one the first one is what
 

397
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,630
and the other one the first one is what
you need

398
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
you need
 

399
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,870
you need
and what the investment for that oh and

400
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
and what the investment for that oh and
 

401
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,949
and what the investment for that oh and
again yeah

402
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
again yeah
 

403
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,829
again yeah
yeah so this is better than this is

404
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
yeah so this is better than this is
 

405
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,110
yeah so this is better than this is
better than

406
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
better than
 

407
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,910
better than
than the second one right okay let's try

408
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
than the second one right okay let's try
 

409
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,509
than the second one right okay let's try
this

410
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
this
 

411
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,550
this
what's this

412
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560

 

413
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,870

girl okay

414
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880

 

415
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,990

that's right

416
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000

 

417
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,430

no yeah no yeah we know not return

418
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
no yeah no yeah we know not return
 

419
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,710
no yeah no yeah we know not return
okay look let's say the piggies the

420
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
okay look let's say the piggies the
 

421
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,190
okay look let's say the piggies the
biggest one and the biggest two

422
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
biggest one and the biggest two
 

423
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,310
biggest one and the biggest two
biggest one because two equals minus

424
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
biggest one because two equals minus
 

425
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,110
biggest one because two equals minus
negative at the beginning right yeah

426
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120

 

427
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,910

and then smallest one equally small is

428
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
and then smallest one equally small is
 

429
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,350
and then smallest one equally small is
two equals one

430
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
two equals one
 

431
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,389
two equals one
if we want to keep the peak is what

432
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
if we want to keep the peak is what
 

433
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,389
if we want to keep the peak is what
the initial value for the smaller small

434
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
the initial value for the smaller small
 

435
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,710
the initial value for the smaller small
value

436
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720

 

437
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,870

yeah the max dot infinity so we can get

438
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
yeah the max dot infinity so we can get
 

439
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,550
yeah the max dot infinity so we can get
a

440
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
a
 

441
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,750
a
thing yeah so for the number

442
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
thing yeah so for the number
 

443
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,670
thing yeah so for the number
yeah i in numbers following the lines

444
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
yeah i in numbers following the lines
 

445
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,230
yeah i in numbers following the lines
again

446
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
again
 

447
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,750
again
all right all right can you tell me

448
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760

 

449
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,590

look is the current number right

450
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
look is the current number right
 

451
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,509
look is the current number right
if i is bigger or equal than b1

452
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
if i is bigger or equal than b1
 

453
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,269
if i is bigger or equal than b1
which is the biggest one so what should

454
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
which is the biggest one so what should
 

455
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,870
which is the biggest one so what should
we do now we

456
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
we do now we
 

457
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,389
we do now we
shall now p1 is the biggest q2 b2 equal

458
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
shall now p1 is the biggest q2 b2 equal
 

459
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,269
shall now p1 is the biggest q2 b2 equal
b1

460
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
b1
 

461
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,829
b1
two equals one yeah and then b one

462
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
two equals one yeah and then b one
 

463
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,269
two equals one yeah and then b one
equals one

464
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
equals one
 

465
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,710
equals one
i right b yeah okay then a

466
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
i right b yeah okay then a
 

467
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,829
i right b yeah okay then a
s is a if if i

468
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
s is a if if i
 

469
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,790
s is a if if i
is bigger or equal b two b three then

470
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
is bigger or equal b two b three then
 

471
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:06,069
is bigger or equal b two b three then
what

472
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079

 

473
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,829

and then we need to do this for the for

474
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
and then we need to do this for the for
 

475
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,829
and then we need to do this for the for
the small one and small two yeah

476
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
the small one and small two yeah
 

477
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,069
the small one and small two yeah
if i is smaller or equal than

478
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
if i is smaller or equal than
 

479
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,190
if i is smaller or equal than
small one yeah if

480
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
small one yeah if
 

481
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,949
small one yeah if
this is a small one this is small two

482
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
this is a small one this is small two
 

483
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,990
this is a small one this is small two
okay we can say we can say s2 equals

484
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
okay we can say we can say s2 equals
 

485
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,670
okay we can say we can say s2 equals
s1 s1 equals

486
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
s1 s1 equals
 

487
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,269
s1 s1 equals
if i is smaller equals

488
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
if i is smaller equals
 

489
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,870
if i is smaller equals
s2 equals one

490
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
s2 equals one
 

491
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,949
s2 equals one
okay and that's it after this we have

492
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
okay and that's it after this we have
 

493
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,069
okay and that's it after this we have
the b1 b2 which is the biggest

494
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
the b1 b2 which is the biggest
 

495
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,949
the b1 b2 which is the biggest
small s1 s4 2 is the smallest and what

496
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
small s1 s4 2 is the smallest and what
 

497
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,230
small s1 s4 2 is the smallest and what
should we do 10

498
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
should we do 10
 

499
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,590
should we do 10
return 1

500
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600

 

501
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,509

b1 b2 x1 s2

502
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
b1 b2 x1 s2
 

503
00:11:51,519 --> 00:12:00,150
b1 b2 x1 s2
