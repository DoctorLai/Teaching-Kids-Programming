00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950

hello

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:00,960
hello
 

3
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,510
hello
hello mr ariel alright today

4
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,520
hello mr ariel alright today
 

5
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,309
hello mr ariel alright today
yeah

6
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
yeah
 

7
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,590
yeah
so today we talk about the longest

8
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
so today we talk about the longest
 

9
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,470
so today we talk about the longest
substring with two distinct characters

10
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480
substring with two distinct characters
 

11
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,270
substring with two distinct characters
longest

12
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,280

 

13
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,790

substring

14
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800

 

15
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,510

with two distinct

16
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:19,520
with two distinct
 

17
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,790
with two distinct
distinct

18
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
distinct
 

19
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,670
distinct
characters

20
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680

 

21
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,589

what's this thing

22
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
what's this thing
 

23
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,390
what's this thing
a b c c that doesn't exist anymore

24
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
a b c c that doesn't exist anymore
 

25
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,830
a b c c that doesn't exist anymore
this thing

26
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
this thing
 

27
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,950
this thing
it doesn't exist anymore uh

28
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960
it doesn't exist anymore uh
 

29
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,110
it doesn't exist anymore uh
kind of distinct characters means that

30
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
kind of distinct characters means that
 

31
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,670
kind of distinct characters means that
you need yeah you need characters so the

32
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
you need yeah you need characters so the
 

33
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,670
you need yeah you need characters so the
longest substring what's that string

34
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
longest substring what's that string
 

35
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,069
longest substring what's that string
abc how many subjects

36
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079

 

37
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,270

six

38
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
six
 

39
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,750
six
oh quick that was quick a b c for one

40
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
oh quick that was quick a b c for one
 

41
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,389
oh quick that was quick a b c for one
one uh character substring a b b c and a

42
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
one uh character substring a b b c and a
 

43
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,670
one uh character substring a b b c and a
b c

44
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
b c
 

45
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,790
b c
yeah

46
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
yeah
 

47
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,590
yeah
so that's five oh six okay

48
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
so that's five oh six okay
 

49
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,030
so that's five oh six okay
continue

50
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
continue
 

51
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,590
continue
so how the longest substring

52
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
so how the longest substring
 

53
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,510
so how the longest substring
right we can find this is the longest

54
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
right we can find this is the longest
 

55
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,030
right we can find this is the longest
searching with two distinct characters

56
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
searching with two distinct characters
 

57
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,429
searching with two distinct characters
because it has b and c only two in this

58
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
because it has b and c only two in this
 

59
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,230
because it has b and c only two in this
here it will be only b and c only two

60
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
here it will be only b and c only two
 

61
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,149
here it will be only b and c only two
right we can't choose this one because

62
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
right we can't choose this one because
 

63
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,789
right we can't choose this one because
the a b c c how many

64
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
the a b c c how many
 

65
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,510
the a b c c how many
how many three yeah a b and c okay got

66
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
how many three yeah a b and c okay got
 

67
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,310
how many three yeah a b and c okay got
it

68
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
it
 

69
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,789
it
yeah okay so that's the question

70
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
yeah okay so that's the question
 

71
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,270
yeah okay so that's the question
so any idea how we're doing this

72
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
so any idea how we're doing this
 

73
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,310
so any idea how we're doing this
if the whole thing is only

74
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
if the whole thing is only
 

75
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,590
if the whole thing is only
meaning

76
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
meaning
 

77
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,950
meaning
all of it

78
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
all of it
 

79
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,310
all of it
uh

80
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320

 

81
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,670

what do you mean uh so again here a b c

82
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
what do you mean uh so again here a b c
 

83
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,270
what do you mean uh so again here a b c
c b

84
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
c b
 

85
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,270
c b
yeah

86
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
yeah
 

87
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,030
yeah
so how we doing this

88
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
so how we doing this
 

89
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,630
so how we doing this
first of all we can you know proof of it

90
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
first of all we can you know proof of it
 

91
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,950
first of all we can you know proof of it
we can if we blue first all the

92
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
we can if we blue first all the
 

93
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,350
we can if we blue first all the
substring how what's the term complexity

94
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
substring how what's the term complexity
 

95
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,429
substring how what's the term complexity
to proof of all assumptions

96
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
to proof of all assumptions
 

97
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,190
to proof of all assumptions
remember every time we proof of the

98
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
remember every time we proof of the
 

99
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,870
remember every time we proof of the
substring in a string we need o

100
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
substring in a string we need o
 

101
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,350
substring in a string we need o
what

102
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360

 

103
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,149

sorry

104
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
sorry
 

105
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,270
sorry
we need to

106
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
we need to
 

107
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,589
we need to
substring the left and the right right

108
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
substring the left and the right right
 

109
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,110
substring the left and the right right
we need to prove what's the left and the

110
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
we need to prove what's the left and the
 

111
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,790
we need to prove what's the left and the
right right

112
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
right right
 

113
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,150
right right
that's the index and the writing there

114
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
that's the index and the writing there
 

115
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,750
that's the index and the writing there
so what is it

116
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
so what is it
 

117
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,670
so what is it
how much complexity it takes look if i i

118
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
how much complexity it takes look if i i
 

119
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,710
how much complexity it takes look if i i
will be blend from 0 to n

120
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
will be blend from 0 to n
 

121
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,070
will be blend from 0 to n
all right

122
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
all right
 

123
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,510
all right
zero to n

124
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
zero to n
 

125
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,229
zero to n
zero to n yeah inclusive and then j will

126
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
zero to n yeah inclusive and then j will
 

127
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,350
zero to n yeah inclusive and then j will
be

128
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
be
 

129
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,869
be
from one

130
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
from one
 

131
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,070
from one
from

132
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
from
 

133
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,229
from
i to n time

134
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
i to n time
 

135
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,470
i to n time
what's the time complexity all right

136
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
what's the time complexity all right
 

137
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,869
what's the time complexity all right
if i use the loop to iterate from zero

138
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
if i use the loop to iterate from zero
 

139
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,070
if i use the loop to iterate from zero
to n minus one and i have a second loop

140
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
to n minus one and i have a second loop
 

141
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,309
to n minus one and i have a second loop
which iterates from i to n what's a term

142
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
which iterates from i to n what's a term
 

143
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,150
which iterates from i to n what's a term
complexity

144
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
complexity
 

145
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,110
complexity
i have a loop i have blue

146
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120

 

147
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,150

so if we each array proof of all the

148
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
so if we each array proof of all the
 

149
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,470
so if we each array proof of all the
substring we need one square and then to

150
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
substring we need one square and then to

to check if there are more than two if
 

155
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,470
to check if there are more than two if
there are two yeah

156
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
there are two yeah
 

157
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,949
there are two yeah
if at

how many distinct characters in this

160
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
how many distinct characters in this
 

161
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,750
how many distinct characters in this
state

162
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760

163
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,430
state
with two

164
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
with two
 

165
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,949
with two
uh in this uh substring how many

166
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
uh in this uh substring how many
 

167
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,790
uh in this uh substring how many
how many characters distinct characters

168
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
how many characters distinct characters
 

169
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,869
how many characters distinct characters
in this substring we missed our entire

170
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
in this substring we missed our entire
 

171
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,869
in this substring we missed our entire
america well right it needs another

172
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
america well right it needs another
 

173
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,030
america well right it needs another
intent so all time complexity is what

174
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
intent so all time complexity is what
 

175
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,630
intent so all time complexity is what
oem times two

176
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
oem times two
 

177
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,789
oem times two
and then we need uh

178
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
and then we need uh
 

179
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,110
and then we need uh
times ten that will be o and qp right

180
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
times ten that will be o and qp right
 

181
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,990
times ten that will be o and qp right
yeah

182
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
yeah
 

183
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,949
yeah
okay

184
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959

 

185
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,869

yeah got it

186
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
yeah got it
 

187
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,589
yeah got it
so we we can do better how can we do

188
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
so we we can do better how can we do
 

189
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,949
so we we can do better how can we do
better

190
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
better
 

191
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,830
better
how can we do better

192
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
how can we do better
 

193
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,990
how can we do better
how can we do better to do can we use

194
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
how can we do better to do can we use
 

195
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,430
how can we do better to do can we use
the

196
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
the
 

197
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,229
the
sliding window thingy so for example we

198
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
sliding window thingy so for example we
 

199
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,309
sliding window thingy so for example we
have a window and then

200
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
have a window and then
 

201
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,509
have a window and then
if we

202
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
if we
 

203
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,270
if we
uh

204
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
uh
 

205
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,429
uh
so we have a window like

206
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
so we have a window like
 

207
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,309
so we have a window like
you know the window abccp

208
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
you know the window abccp
 

209
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,190
you know the window abccp
so

210
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
so
 

211
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,350
so
at the beginning the window is a

212
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
at the beginning the window is a
 

213
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,869
at the beginning the window is a
okay so currently we have uh

214
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
okay so currently we have uh
 

215
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,630
okay so currently we have uh
we only have one

216
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
we only have one
 

217
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,869
we only have one
distinct parameter so we move on we add

218
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
distinct parameter so we move on we add
 

219
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,869
distinct parameter so we move on we add
explain the window ap right yeah now two

220
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
explain the window ap right yeah now two
 

221
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,270
explain the window ap right yeah now two
there are two which is okay now it's two

222
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
there are two which is okay now it's two
 

223
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,789
there are two which is okay now it's two
so now i add another if we if we satisfy

224
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
so now i add another if we if we satisfy
 

225
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,789
so now i add another if we if we satisfy
the requirement i keep adding

226
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
the requirement i keep adding
 

227
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,509
the requirement i keep adding
and now look this is the left this is

228
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
and now look this is the left this is
 

229
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,030
and now look this is the left this is
the right

230
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
the right
 

231
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,030
the right
so now what happened if this does not

232
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
so now what happened if this does not
 

233
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,189
so now what happened if this does not
satisfy right so the left tends to be

234
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
satisfy right so the left tends to be
 

235
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,270
satisfy right so the left tends to be
i move like that yeah

236
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
i move like that yeah
 

237
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,550
i move like that yeah
right

238
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
right
 

239
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,390
right
okay it says it's right that's okay and

240
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
okay it says it's right that's okay and
 

241
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,270
okay it says it's right that's okay and
then i reset if we satisfy i keep adding

242
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
then i reset if we satisfy i keep adding
 

243
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,430
then i reset if we satisfy i keep adding
to the right hand side now it's okay

244
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
to the right hand side now it's okay
 

245
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,150
to the right hand side now it's okay
yeah

246
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
yeah
 

247
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,430
yeah
pcc so

248
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
pcc so
 

249
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,590
pcc so
and at the meantime i'm like updating

250
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
and at the meantime i'm like updating
 

251
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,950
and at the meantime i'm like updating
the answer okay

252
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
the answer okay
 

253
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,110
the answer okay
and then look if i adding

254
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
and then look if i adding
 

255
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,070
and then look if i adding
uh

256
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
uh
 

257
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,790
uh
so the next is adding the b here okay

258
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
so the next is adding the b here okay
 

259
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,790
so the next is adding the b here okay
and then now this this is the maximum

260
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
and then now this this is the maximum
 

261
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,270
and then now this this is the maximum
substring we have got with two because

262
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
substring we have got with two because
 

263
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,270
substring we have got with two because
the the question is asking about the two

264
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
the the question is asking about the two
 

265
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,430
the the question is asking about the two
distinct characters yes if it's two

266
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
distinct characters yes if it's two
 

267
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,270
distinct characters yes if it's two
distinct characters

268
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
distinct characters
 

269
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,790
distinct characters
okay

270
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800

 

271
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,950

so what kind of the data structure we

272
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
so what kind of the data structure we
 

273
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,749
so what kind of the data structure we
can use to keep tracking the distinct

274
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
can use to keep tracking the distinct
 

275
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,230
can use to keep tracking the distinct
characters in a window

276
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240

 

277
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,950

what kind of data structure we can use

278
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
what kind of data structure we can use
 

279
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,110
what kind of data structure we can use
to keep tracking the distinct

280
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120

 

281
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,029

to keep tracking the distinct

282
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
to keep tracking the distinct
 

283
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,670
to keep tracking the distinct
characters in the window you know if we

284
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
characters in the window you know if we
 

285
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,670
characters in the window you know if we
only keep counting so we can use what

286
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
only keep counting so we can use what
 

287
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,469
only keep counting so we can use what
kind of data structure are we

288
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
kind of data structure are we
 

289
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,430
kind of data structure are we
um

290
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
um
 

291
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,510
um
call the weather notebook okay

292
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
call the weather notebook okay
 

293
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,430
call the weather notebook okay
so we can use the notebook

294
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
so we can use the notebook
 

295
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,590
so we can use the notebook
okay let's do it quickly

296
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
okay let's do it quickly
 

297
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,390
okay let's do it quickly
so

298
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
so
 

299
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,950
so
n equals length bands

300
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
n equals length bands
 

301
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,870
n equals length bands
so l r

302
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
so l r
 

303
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,749
so l r
equals zero zero okay at the beginning

304
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
equals zero zero okay at the beginning
 

305
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,590
equals zero zero okay at the beginning
then look the sliding window thing it

306
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
then look the sliding window thing it
 

307
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,550
then look the sliding window thing it
has this this kind of uh

308
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
has this this kind of uh
 

309
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,029
has this this kind of uh
format it would be something like wire

310
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
format it would be something like wire
 

311
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,189
format it would be something like wire
why the right pointer yeah why the right

312
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
why the right pointer yeah why the right
 

313
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,590
why the right pointer yeah why the right
point should be smaller than what

314
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
point should be smaller than what
 

315
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,749
point should be smaller than what
come on see which is smaller than one

316
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
come on see which is smaller than one
 

317
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,990
come on see which is smaller than one
while the r is not reaching the end yeah

318
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
while the r is not reaching the end yeah
 

319
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,670
while the r is not reaching the end yeah
so what should we put here

320
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
so what should we put here
 

321
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,350
so what should we put here
and we're done okay

322
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
and we're done okay
 

323
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,950
and we're done okay
now we we

324
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
now we we
 

325
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,430
now we we
the r is the we are in the position r

326
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
the r is the we are in the position r
 

327
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,469
the r is the we are in the position r
right

328
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
right
 

329
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,029
right
a a b c c b here we are air here r here

330
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
a a b c c b here we are air here r here
 

331
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,749
a a b c c b here we are air here r here
so now we need to add this r right

332
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
so now we need to add this r right
 

333
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,749
so now we need to add this r right
to the window okay so let's put a window

334
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:19,759
to the window okay so let's put a window
 

335
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,550
to the window okay so let's put a window
window here equals default dictionary

336
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
window here equals default dictionary
 

337
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,749
window here equals default dictionary
all right

338
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
all right
 

339
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,430
all right
different dictionary

340
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
different dictionary
 

341
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,189
different dictionary
yeah hint

342
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199

plus equals one right look
 

363
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,469
plus equals one right look
look at this

364
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
look at this
 

365
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,029
look at this
sr is the character a and i put it in a

366
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
sr is the character a and i put it in a
 

367
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,670
sr is the character a and i put it in a
wing plus equal one right and then now i

368
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
wing plus equal one right and then now i
 

369
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,830
wing plus equal one right and then now i
need to check the window if

370
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
need to check the window if
 

371
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,589
need to check the window if
y

372
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
y
 

373
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,909
y
if look it was

374
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
if look it was
 

375
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,990
if look it was
if air smaller equals r

376
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
if air smaller equals r
 

377
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,749
if air smaller equals r
n

378
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
n
 

379
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,230
n
and then length of the windows key yeah

380
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
and then length of the windows key yeah
 

381
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,629
and then length of the windows key yeah
because the windows key is the

382
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
because the windows key is the
 

383
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,270
because the windows key is the
is the number of in characters in it

384
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
is the number of in characters in it
 

385
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,230
is the number of in characters in it
right and i should i should do a bigger

386
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
right and i should i should do a bigger
 

387
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,629
right and i should i should do a bigger
than if this is bigger than two right if

388
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
than if this is bigger than two right if
 

389
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,990
than if this is bigger than two right if
this is bigger than two what does it

390
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
this is bigger than two what does it
 

391
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,309
this is bigger than two what does it
mean if if it's bigger than two it means

392
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
mean if if it's bigger than two it means
 

393
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,350
mean if if it's bigger than two it means
that uh

394
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
that uh
 

395
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,830
that uh
uh it means what it means that there are

396
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
uh it means what it means that there are
 

397
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,909
uh it means what it means that there are
more than two uh distinct characters in

398
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
more than two uh distinct characters in
 

399
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,990
more than two uh distinct characters in
the window right then we need to do what

the right right
 

463
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,269
the right right
we need to move the right class equal

464
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
we need to move the right class equal
 

465
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:50,150
we need to move the right class equal
one and then we turn one

r is smaller than n i knew as well i

514
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
r is smaller than n i knew as well i
 

515
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,670
r is smaller than n i knew as well i
think was here right it's smaller than n

516
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
think was here right it's smaller than n
 

517
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,630
think was here right it's smaller than n
then win r so it will be a with plus

518
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
then win r so it will be a with plus
 

519
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,230
then win r so it will be a with plus
equal one right that's what it means

520
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
equal one right that's what it means
 

521
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,269
equal one right that's what it means
this one

522
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
this one
 

523
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,630
this one
for the a

524
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
for the a
 

525
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,870
for the a
plus equal y

526
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
plus equal y
 

527
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,030
plus equal y
okay so now it doesn't get into the loop

528
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
okay so now it doesn't get into the loop
 

529
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,509
okay so now it doesn't get into the loop
because the windows key that they then

530
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
because the windows key that they then
 

531
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,430
because the windows key that they then
win key only one right so it doesn't go

532
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
win key only one right so it doesn't go
 

533
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,990
win key only one right so it doesn't go
to it okay now air is here

534
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
to it okay now air is here
 

535
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,750
to it okay now air is here
i is here right

536
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
i is here right
 

537
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,269
i is here right
yeah

538
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
yeah
 

539
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,870
yeah
i i

540
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
i i
 

541
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,430
i i
execute this one so what happened to

542
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
execute this one so what happened to
 

543
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,750
execute this one so what happened to
this wing

544
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760

 

545
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,150

this will turn into uh because there's a

546
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
this will turn into uh because there's a
 

547
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,430
this will turn into uh because there's a
a is one and now i have another a okay

548
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
a is one and now i have another a okay
 

549
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,670
a is one and now i have another a okay
okay so now the lens key is also one

550
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
okay so now the lens key is also one
 

551
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,150
okay so now the lens key is also one
because lens keys is how many keys here

552
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
because lens keys is how many keys here
 

553
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,069
because lens keys is how many keys here
there will be only one right so you keep

554
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
there will be only one right so you keep
 

555
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,790
there will be only one right so you keep
moving ah i'll keep moving there yeah

556
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
moving ah i'll keep moving there yeah
 

557
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,870
moving ah i'll keep moving there yeah
answer will keep up at updating answer

558
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
answer will keep up at updating answer
 

559
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,350
answer will keep up at updating answer
now will be three two two right end of

560
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
now will be three two two right end of
 

561
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,550
now will be three two two right end of
b2

562
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
b2
 

563
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,110
b2
yeah okay now see i added so that will

564
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
yeah okay now see i added so that will
 

565
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,430
yeah okay now see i added so that will
be c equals one here right

566
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
be c equals one here right
 

567
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,350
be c equals one here right
you see

568
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
you see
 

569
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,590
you see
c u equals one and then

570
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
c u equals one and then
 

571
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,750
c u equals one and then
is it bigger than one two no it's equals

572
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
is it bigger than one two no it's equals
 

573
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,590
is it bigger than one two no it's equals
two so it doesn't get into here as well

574
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
two so it doesn't get into here as well
 

575
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,670
two so it doesn't get into here as well
and answer equals this so answer will be

576
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
and answer equals this so answer will be
 

577
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,190
and answer equals this so answer will be
three right because

578
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
three right because
 

579
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,470
three right because
because c minus r a there will be three

580
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
because c minus r a there will be three
 

581
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,550
because c minus r a there will be three
characters okay so that next one is

582
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
characters okay so that next one is
 

583
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,470
characters okay so that next one is
interesting okay look

584
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
interesting okay look
 

585
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,829
interesting okay look
i add the e

586
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
i add the e
 

587
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,710
i add the e
either s e e will be equal as one here

588
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
either s e e will be equal as one here
 

589
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,790
either s e e will be equal as one here
right yeah

590
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
right yeah
 

591
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,110
right yeah
look but look air's smaller than up but

592
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
look but look air's smaller than up but
 

593
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,030
look but look air's smaller than up but
that lands the key so how many keys in

594
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
that lands the key so how many keys in
 

595
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,550
that lands the key so how many keys in
the wing

596
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
the wing
 

597
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,910
the wing
how many characters in the wind

598
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920

 

599
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,870

there are

600
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
there are
 

601
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,910
there are
four

602
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
four
 

603
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,430
four
what is well there are only three one

604
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
what is well there are only three one
 

605
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,030
what is well there are only three one
ace the keys the keys so look so i need

606
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
ace the keys the keys so look so i need
 

607
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,829
ace the keys the keys so look so i need
to air what's alpha s a right

608
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
to air what's alpha s a right
 

609
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,590
to air what's alpha s a right
yeah

610
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
yeah
 

611
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,710
yeah
yeah

612
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
yeah
 

613
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,110
yeah
keyboard that's one right

614
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
keyboard that's one right
 

615
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,750
keyboard that's one right
now become one reduce one one if it's

616
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
now become one reduce one one if it's
 

617
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,150
now become one reduce one one if it's
then zero no it's zero it's still one

618
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
then zero no it's zero it's still one
 

619
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,870
then zero no it's zero it's still one
okay l plus equals one

620
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
okay l plus equals one
 

621
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,350
okay l plus equals one
and plus is one so l is here

622
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
and plus is one so l is here
 

623
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,470
and plus is one so l is here
right

624
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
right
 

625
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,990
right
and what's the key it's still bigger

626
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
and what's the key it's still bigger
 

627
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,509
and what's the key it's still bigger
than two e3 right

628
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
than two e3 right
 

629
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,990
than two e3 right
so i still need to remove it so i i make

630
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
so i still need to remove it so i i make
 

631
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,230
so i still need to remove it so i i make
this to do a one reduce this to zero

632
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
this to do a one reduce this to zero
 

633
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,230
this to do a one reduce this to zero
eric look

634
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
eric look
 

635
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,069
eric look
i know what happened if this is zero

636
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
i know what happened if this is zero
 

637
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,670
i know what happened if this is zero
what happened

638
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
what happened
 

639
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,550
what happened
they did what does this mean did this

640
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
they did what does this mean did this
 

641
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,190
they did what does this mean did this
so they did it i just moved it yeah

642
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
so they did it i just moved it yeah
 

643
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,590
so they did it i just moved it yeah
and l will become here

644
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
and l will become here
 

645
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,670
and l will become here
okay so now it's satisfied because it

646
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
okay so now it's satisfied because it
 

647
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,750
okay so now it's satisfied because it
equals two not bigger than two okay so

648
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
equals two not bigger than two okay so
 

649
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,310
equals two not bigger than two okay so
now i can go and break the loop answer

650
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
now i can go and break the loop answer
 

651
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,310
now i can go and break the loop answer
equals answer r minus l is two

652
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
equals answer r minus l is two
 

653
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,949
equals answer r minus l is two
characters we already have three do you

654
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
characters we already have three do you
 

655
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,870
characters we already have three do you
get to understand this problem

656
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
get to understand this problem
 

657
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,110
get to understand this problem
yeah we will keep going

658
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
yeah we will keep going
 

659
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,030
yeah we will keep going
yeah

660
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
yeah
 

661
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,910
yeah
if

662
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
if
 

663
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,069
if
we have uh if

664
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
we have uh if
 

665
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,030
we have uh if
we're keeping adding the characters at

666
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
we're keeping adding the characters at
 

667
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,870
we're keeping adding the characters at
the right hand side expanding to the

668
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
the right hand side expanding to the
 

669
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,269
the right hand side expanding to the
right the window right and if it breaks

670
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
right the window right and if it breaks
 

671
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,350
right the window right and if it breaks
the condition that more than two

672
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
the condition that more than two
 

673
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,230
the condition that more than two
then we dedicate the characters at the

674
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
then we dedicate the characters at the
 

675
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,190
then we dedicate the characters at the
left

676
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
left
 

677
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,590
left
right and if we reduce to what zero we

678
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
right and if we reduce to what zero we
 

679
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,750
right and if we reduce to what zero we
take it out of the

680
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
take it out of the
 

681
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,790
take it out of the
map right the window map right

682
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
map right the window map right
 

683
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,949
map right the window map right
yeah yeah

684
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
yeah yeah
 

685
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,470
yeah yeah
do you see how how beauty this is yeah

686
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
do you see how how beauty this is yeah
 

687
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,829
do you see how how beauty this is yeah
do you get it

688
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
do you get it
 

689
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,910
do you get it
and the proof is just trying every

690
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
and the proof is just trying every
 

691
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,990
and the proof is just trying every
possibility of their

692
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
possibility of their
 

693
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,470
possibility of their
substrings and then checking right any

694
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
substrings and then checking right any
 

695
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,310
substrings and then checking right any
questions so far why

696
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
questions so far why
 

697
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,590
questions so far why
are you sure

698
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
are you sure
 

699
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,389
are you sure
can you explain to me

700
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
can you explain to me
 

701
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,269
can you explain to me
sorry i carry right

702
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
sorry i carry right
 

703
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,509
sorry i carry right
yeah yeah i know so so can you tell me

704
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
yeah yeah i know so so can you tell me
 

705
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,910
yeah yeah i know so so can you tell me
what's this part doing

706
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
what's this part doing
 

707
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,829
what's this part doing
what's this pattern

708
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839

 

709
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,509

what's this pattern what's this part

710
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
what's this pattern what's this part
 

711
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,829
what's this pattern what's this part
doing i'm trying to do

712
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
doing i'm trying to do
 

713
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:26,949
doing i'm trying to do
what's

714
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
what's
 

715
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,440
what's
this one

716
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:27,450
this one
 

717
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,069
this one
[Music]

718
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
[Music]
 

719
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,230
[Music]
right yeah yeah

720
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
right yeah yeah
 

721
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,389
right yeah yeah
now this bit what's this bit too trying

722
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
now this bit what's this bit too trying
 

723
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,389
now this bit what's this bit too trying
to do

724
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399

 

725
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,590

yeah what's this trying to do oh i'm

726
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
yeah what's this trying to do oh i'm
 

727
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,030
yeah what's this trying to do oh i'm
checking that

728
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
checking that
 

729
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,870
checking that
keys

730
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
keys
 

731
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,629
keys
yeah the key the number of keys is

732
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
yeah the key the number of keys is
 

733
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,550
yeah the key the number of keys is
number of distinct characters in the

734
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,560
number of distinct characters in the
 

735
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,790
number of distinct characters in the
window right in the substring if it's

736
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
window right in the substring if it's
 

737
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,350
window right in the substring if it's
more than two then we need to remove it

738
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
more than two then we need to remove it
 

739
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,509
more than two then we need to remove it
from the left hand side to take it out

740
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
from the left hand side to take it out
 

741
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,870
from the left hand side to take it out
of the window right

742
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
of the window right
 

743
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,230
of the window right
correct

744
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
correct
 

745
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,670
correct
yeah

746
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
yeah
 

747
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,069
yeah
let's keep moving the left inside to

748
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
let's keep moving the left inside to
 

749
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,670
let's keep moving the left inside to
make the window smaller to make the

750
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
make the window smaller to make the
 

751
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,310
make the window smaller to make the
substring smaller because now what i

752
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
substring smaller because now what i
 

753
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,350
substring smaller because now what i
have what we have got like abb

754
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
have what we have got like abb
 

755
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,189
have what we have got like abb
uh abc look

756
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
uh abc look
 

757
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,910
uh abc look
we want the two and those two we want to

758
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
we want the two and those two we want to
 

759
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,590
we want the two and those two we want to
substring uh distinct characters now we

760
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600
substring uh distinct characters now we
 

761
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,150
substring uh distinct characters now we
have three so what what happened if keep

762
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
have three so what what happened if keep
 

763
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,030
have three so what what happened if keep
moving this

764
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040

 

765
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,030

what happened it will you

766
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
what happened it will you
 

767
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,030
what happened it will you
if we keep moving at this point to the

768
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
if we keep moving at this point to the
 

769
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,870
if we keep moving at this point to the
right what happened

770
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
right what happened
 

771
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,629
right what happened
let's distinct characters will not

772
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
let's distinct characters will not
 

773
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,949
let's distinct characters will not
reduce right will not decrease right

774
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
reduce right will not decrease right
 

775
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,310
reduce right will not decrease right
yeah because we already have three

776
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
yeah because we already have three
 

777
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,629
yeah because we already have three
characters if you keep adding

778
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
characters if you keep adding
 

779
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,189
characters if you keep adding
yeah it will keep adding so how can we

780
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
yeah it will keep adding so how can we
 

781
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,710
yeah it will keep adding so how can we
fix this

782
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720
fix this
 

783
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,069
fix this
we move the left hand side right

784
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
we move the left hand side right
 

785
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,509
we move the left hand side right
you're looking at me a lot we keep

786
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
you're looking at me a lot we keep
 

787
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,150
you're looking at me a lot we keep
moving and then am i right yeah yeah

788
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,160
moving and then am i right yeah yeah
 

789
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,389
moving and then am i right yeah yeah
okay that's why i'm moving yeah

790
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
okay that's why i'm moving yeah
 

791
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,670
okay that's why i'm moving yeah
okay

792
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
okay
 

793
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,590
okay
and the eyes are updating here okay

794
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
and the eyes are updating here okay
 

795
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,839
and the eyes are updating here okay
that's it for today good job bye
