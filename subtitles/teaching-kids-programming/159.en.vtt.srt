5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,230
mr ryan how are you today good okay so
yeah today we talk about the maze

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
yeah today we talk about the maze
 

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,749
yeah today we talk about the maze
what is maze it's like you're in the

8
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
what is maze it's like you're in the
 

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,440
what is maze it's like you're in the
maze and you need to go

10
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:18,450

 

11
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:27,830

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,590
not easy okay so given look
um let's just try this how can how can

18
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
um let's just try this how can how can
 

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,069
um let's just try this how can how can
we

20
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
we
 

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,069
we
draw a maze good good one okay

22
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
draw a maze good good one okay
 

23
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,110
draw a maze good good one okay
hey the zero zeros are the party cooker

24
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
hey the zero zeros are the party cooker
 

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,110
hey the zero zeros are the party cooker
and the ones are the wolves

26
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
and the ones are the wolves
 

27
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,430
and the ones are the wolves
that that's gonna be super easy

28
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
that that's gonna be super easy
 

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,350
that that's gonna be super easy
yeah so zeros and uh empty space you can

30
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
yeah so zeros and uh empty space you can
 

31
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,470
yeah so zeros and uh empty space you can
walk one

32
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
walk one
 

33
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,069
walk one
the wall okay one wall

34
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079
the wall okay one wall
 

35
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,830
the wall okay one wall
and west engine engine is the top left

36
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
and west engine engine is the top left
 

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,830
and west engine engine is the top left
yeah yeah engine yeah

38
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
yeah yeah engine yeah
 

39
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,390
yeah yeah engine yeah
and when's the exit yeah the bottom

40
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
and when's the exit yeah the bottom
 

41
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,350
and when's the exit yeah the bottom
right

42
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
right
 

43
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,429
right
exit so here look you can go here

44
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
exit so here look you can go here
 

45
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,990
exit so here look you can go here
oh i can go here go here go ahead go

46
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
oh i can go here go here go ahead go
 

47
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,550
oh i can go here go here go ahead go
ahead go

48
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
ahead go
 

49
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,910
ahead go
go go yeah okay so

50
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
go go yeah okay so
 

51
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,190
go go yeah okay so
what's the shortest distance one two

52
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
what's the shortest distance one two
 

53
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,630
what's the shortest distance one two
three four five six seven eight okay

54
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
three four five six seven eight okay
 

55
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,270
three four five six seven eight okay
so eight steps the the shortest distance

56
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
so eight steps the the shortest distance
 

57
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,310
so eight steps the the shortest distance
is that

58
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
is that
 

59
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,670
is that
however however if i broke it

60
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
however however if i broke it
 

61
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,670
however however if i broke it
here there is no way now you need to

62
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
here there is no way now you need to
 

63
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,350
here there is no way now you need to
tell me it's minus one

64
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
tell me it's minus one
 

65
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,870
tell me it's minus one
right doesn't make sense if i block it

66
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
right doesn't make sense if i block it
 

67
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,630
right doesn't make sense if i block it
there's no path

68
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
there's no path
 

69
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,830
there's no path
yeah if if the

70
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
yeah if if the
 

71
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,109
yeah if if the
axis is one you always return minus one

72
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
axis is one you always return minus one
 

73
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,550
axis is one you always return minus one
or the entrance is my

74
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
or the entrance is my
 

75
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,230
or the entrance is my
one you'll return minus one as well

76
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
one you'll return minus one as well
 

77
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,270
one you'll return minus one as well
right because the ancient and uh

78
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
right because the ancient and uh
 

79
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,510
right because the ancient and uh
are blocked okay okay so is it clear

80
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
are blocked okay okay so is it clear
 

81
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,990
are blocked okay okay so is it clear
is it clear this problem is it clear yes

82
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
is it clear this problem is it clear yes
 

83
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,029
is it clear this problem is it clear yes
how do we solve this

84
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039

 

85
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,790

okay with a matrix magic okay

86
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
okay with a matrix magic okay
 

87
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,589
okay with a matrix magic okay
so one over is shortest distance okay we

88
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
so one over is shortest distance okay we
 

89
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,990
so one over is shortest distance okay we
want the shortest distance

90
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
want the shortest distance
 

91
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,350
want the shortest distance
and it's uh it's you can you can expand

92
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
and it's uh it's you can you can expand
 

93
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,470
and it's uh it's you can you can expand
it as like a

94
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
it as like a
 

95
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,070
it as like a
search graph search problem right

96
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
search graph search problem right
 

97
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,670
search graph search problem right
how do you search your graph with the

98
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
how do you search your graph with the
 

99
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,830
how do you search your graph with the
shortest distance

100
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840

 

101
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,880

uh

102
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:38,890

 

103
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:52,390

[Music]

104
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400

 

105
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,430

yeah yeah

106
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
yeah yeah
 

107
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,790
yeah yeah
and then i'll give you a hint okay so at

108
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
and then i'll give you a hint okay so at
 

109
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,750
and then i'll give you a hint okay so at
this point

110
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
this point
 

111
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,830
this point
at any point i can go to four direction

112
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840
at any point i can go to four direction
 

113
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,990
at any point i can go to four direction
right oh yeah i like

114
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
right oh yeah i like
 

115
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,110
right oh yeah i like
you you can be comfortable here okay

116
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
you you can be comfortable here okay
 

117
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,390
you you can be comfortable here okay
so so look if look look if

118
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
so so look if look look if
 

119
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,270
so so look if look look if
this entrance i can go to the four

120
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
this entrance i can go to the four
 

121
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,670
this entrance i can go to the four
directions right or two directions yeah

122
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
directions right or two directions yeah
 

123
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,110
directions right or two directions yeah
possibly four right even here okay so

124
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
possibly four right even here okay so
 

125
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,750
possibly four right even here okay so
look

126
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
look
 

127
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,190
look
you can expand it as the next four nodes

128
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
you can expand it as the next four nodes
 

129
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,509
you can expand it as the next four nodes
so what does it look like and i know

130
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
so what does it look like and i know
 

131
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,710
so what does it look like and i know
here you can have

132
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
here you can have
 

133
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,789
here you can have
another directions until we reach the

134
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
another directions until we reach the
 

135
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,589
another directions until we reach the
end

136
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
end
 

137
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,110
end
what does it look like every tree

138
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
what does it look like every tree
 

139
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,190
what does it look like every tree
yeah but how do we travel this look and

140
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
yeah but how do we travel this look and
 

141
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,309
yeah but how do we travel this look and
here you have

142
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
here you have
 

143
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,710
here you have
another four maybe or maybe three and

144
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
another four maybe or maybe three and
 

145
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,869
another four maybe or maybe three and
here you have another one four

146
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
here you have another one four
 

147
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,030
here you have another one four
and here you have another what what is

148
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
and here you have another what what is
 

149
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,350
and here you have another what what is
it and then go to the next level

150
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
it and then go to the next level
 

151
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,910
it and then go to the next level
the binary tree is actually like going

152
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
the binary tree is actually like going
 

153
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,869
the binary tree is actually like going
in quarters

154
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879

 

155
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,910

so what does it look like no so what

156
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
so what does it look like no so what
 

157
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,110
so what does it look like no so what
does it look like if i

158
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
does it look like if i
 

159
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,190
does it look like if i
push this one and then the next step and

160
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
push this one and then the next step and
 

161
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,309
push this one and then the next step and
then the next step

162
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
then the next step
 

163
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,270
then the next step
and the next step an alien so look this

164
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
and the next step an alien so look this
 

165
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,990
and the next step an alien so look this
is step one

166
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000

 

167
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,229

now this is a step one first step

168
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239

 

169
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,920

okay enough enough and whenever you

182
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
okay enough enough and whenever you
 

183
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,510
okay enough enough and whenever you
you visit let look the breakfast search

184
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
you visit let look the breakfast search
 

185
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,390
you visit let look the breakfast search
gives us the

186
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
gives us the
 

187
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,110
gives us the
guarantee of the shortest distance right

188
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
guarantee of the shortest distance right

guarantees the shutting this time right
 

191
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,990
guarantees the shutting this time right
yeah yeah because look i reached the

192
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
yeah yeah because look i reached the
 

193
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,790
yeah yeah because look i reached the
step one

194
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
step one
 

195
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,070
step one
with the step two if but the first

196
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
with the step two if but the first
 

197
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,430
with the step two if but the first
first time if i meet i am an exit

198
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
first time if i meet i am an exit
 

199
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,430
first time if i meet i am an exit
it i can guarantee is the shortest am

200
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
it i can guarantee is the shortest am
 

201
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,710
it i can guarantee is the shortest am
right

202
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
right
 

203
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,909
right
yeah doesn't make sense okay so let's

204
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
yeah doesn't make sense okay so let's
 

205
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,909
yeah doesn't make sense okay so let's
break research so we can we can treat

206
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
break research so we can we can treat
 

207
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,430
break research so we can we can treat
this as a graph okay

208
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
this as a graph okay
 

209
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,550
this as a graph okay
this is what it's like yeah okay let's

210
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
this is what it's like yeah okay let's
 

211
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,500
this is what it's like yeah okay let's
go

212

let's do this i'll give you already the

216
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
let's do this i'll give you already the
 

217
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,350
let's do this i'll give you already the
hint look a shortest distance square

218
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
hint look a shortest distance square
 

219
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,990
hint look a shortest distance square
graph and can we solve this using the

220
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
graph and can we solve this using the
 

221
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,310
graph and can we solve this using the
temperature yep

222
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
temperature yep
 

223
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,629
temperature yep
yes maybe but breakfast search is ideal

224
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
yes maybe but breakfast search is ideal
 

225
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,390
yes maybe but breakfast search is ideal
here because therefore search you always

226
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
here because therefore search you always
 

227
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,350
here because therefore search you always
go to the

228
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
go to the
 

229
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,670
go to the
right you always go as deep as you want

230
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
right you always go as deep as you want
 

231
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,430
right you always go as deep as you want
but you don't know if you let loads

232
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
but you don't know if you let loads
 

233
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,590
but you don't know if you let loads
these three exit right you might

234
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
these three exit right you might
 

235
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,670
these three exit right you might
spending time

236
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
spending time
 

237
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,430
spending time
trying uh impossible path i'm right yeah

238
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
trying uh impossible path i'm right yeah
 

239
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:47,350
trying uh impossible path i'm right yeah
doesn't make sense

240
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360

 

241
00:05:47,360 --> 00:06:05,029

this looks easy escape mix

242
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039

 

243
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,309

rules is length of metric right and

244
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
rules is length of metric right and
 

245
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,830
rules is length of metric right and
column

246
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
column
 

247
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,710
column
is length on the you know the first

248
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
is length on the you know the first
 

249
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,749
is length on the you know the first
metric so it's

250
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
metric so it's
 

251
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,950
metric so it's
m0 right right okay

252
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
m0 right right okay

column equals zero what does it mean it
 

267
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,390
column equals zero what does it mean it
means the main is empty

268
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
means the main is empty
 

269
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,510
means the main is empty

287
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,469

okay so look if m 0 so which element is

288
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
okay so look if m 0 so which element is
 

289
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,589
okay so look if m 0 so which element is
this

yeah minus one the last element yeah so

294
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
yeah minus one the last element yeah so
 

295
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,790
yeah minus one the last element yeah so
if either of them

296
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
if either of them
 

297
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,790
if either of them
is one it means the entrance or the axis

298
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
is one it means the entrance or the axis
 

299
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,469
is one it means the entrance or the axis
is blocked when we do ten minus one

how can you smash it okay
 

305
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,909
how can you smash it okay
smash what kind of data structure we

306
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
smash what kind of data structure we
 

307
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:57,150
smash what kind of data structure we
need to use to implement

pop in
 

323
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,670
pop in
okay okay now look so first of all we

okay okay now look so first of all we
 

325
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,149
okay okay now look so first of all we
need to

326
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
need to
 

327
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,990
need to
push the first element into the queue

328
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
push the first element into the queue
 

329
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,190
push the first element into the queue
right so which is the

330
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
right so which is the
 

331
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,230
right so which is the
look alright q q equals

332
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
look alright q q equals
 

333
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,590
look alright q q equals
d q okay

334
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
d q okay
 

335
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,310
d q okay
and i'll push the zero zero the first

336
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
and i'll push the zero zero the first
 

337
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,590
and i'll push the zero zero the first

minus one right and
 

379
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,829

this look
 

427
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,990
this look
zero one this is the offset yeah

428
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
zero one this is the offset yeah
 

429
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,269
zero one this is the offset yeah
zero one means that right right

430
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
zero one means that right right
 

431
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,470
zero one means that right right
one zero is what if zero one is y

432
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
one zero is what if zero one is y
 

433
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,310
one zero is what if zero one is y
one zero is one left no no no

434
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
one zero is one left no no no
 

435
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,310
one zero is one left no no no
zero one is right zero minus one is left

436
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
zero one is right zero minus one is left
 

437
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,629
zero one is right zero minus one is left
and one zero is one

438
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
and one zero is one
 

439
00:11:52,639 --> 00:12:03,509
and one zero is one
one zero down the bottom

440
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519

 

441
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,790

look because it's rows rows all right

442
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
look because it's rows rows all right
 

443
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,750
look because it's rows rows all right
this is rows this is columns yeah all

444
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
this is rows this is columns yeah all
 

445
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,949
this is rows this is columns yeah all
right

446
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
right
 

447
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,230
right
look zero one means what rows plus zero

448
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
look zero one means what rows plus zero
 

449
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,190
look zero one means what rows plus zero
columns plus one so it's on the right

450
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
columns plus one so it's on the right
 

451
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,750
columns plus one so it's on the right
right

452
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:19,760
right
 

453
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,870
right
yeah doesn't make sense

454
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
yeah doesn't make sense
 

455
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,269
yeah doesn't make sense
okay look and then nr equals

456
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
okay look and then nr equals
 

457
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,790
okay look and then nr equals
r plus dr can you tell me nc equals one

458
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800

 

459
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,829

c c plus pc

00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
c c plus pc
 

461
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:44,069
c c plus pc
dc

462
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079

 

463
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,150

464
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
smaller than rose right and
 

465
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,389
smaller than rose right and
and what

466
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
and what
 

467
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,350
and what
rows the new rows is between the size of

468
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
rows the new rows is between the size of
 

469
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,910
rows the new rows is between the size of
between 0 and rows and then

470
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
between 0 and rows and then
 

471
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,750
between 0 and rows and then
and then nc 0 smaller than

472
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
and then nc 0 smaller than
 

473
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,509
and then nc 0 smaller than
nc smaller than color right yeah

474
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
nc smaller than color right yeah
 

475
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,430
nc smaller than color right yeah
also also n and one

476
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
also also n and one
 

477
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,870
also also n and one
and m and r

478
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
and m and r
 

479
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,550
and m and r
and c is not the it's not the wall so

480
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
and c is not the it's not the wall so
 

481
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,829
and c is not the it's not the wall so
what what's your idea

482
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
what what's your idea
 

483
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,030
what what's your idea
if it a new the next picture is

484
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
if it a new the next picture is
 

485
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,629
if it a new the next picture is
not a wall so what should i put here

486
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
not a wall so what should i put here
 

487
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,829
not a wall so what should i put here
e m is n r and c is not

488
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
e m is n r and c is not
 

489
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,150
e m is n r and c is not
equal to one it's not equal to

490
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
equal to one it's not equal to
 

491
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,430
equal to one it's not equal to
and

492
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440

 

493
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,629

so i'm here at an r on the current

494
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
so i'm here at an r on the current
 

495
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,590
so i'm here at an r on the current
position rc

496
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
position rc
 

497
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,750
position rc
and the next partition is n r and c try

498
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
and the next partition is n r and c try
 

499
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,430
and the next partition is n r and c try
to try these four directions

500
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
to try these four directions
 

501
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,750
to try these four directions
and if the next direction is still in

502
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
and if the next direction is still in
 

503
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,350
and if the next direction is still in
this maze not brought

504
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
this maze not brought
 

505
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,470
this maze not brought
not outside the maze and also it's not

506
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
not outside the maze and also it's not
 

507
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,150
not outside the maze and also it's not

one
 

579
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,670
one
tiny problem

580
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680

 

581
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,230

it's like look if i'm here all right

582
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
it's like look if i'm here all right
 

583
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,870
it's like look if i'm here all right
yeah

584
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
yeah
 

585
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,030
yeah
if i'm here i push it next step here

586
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040
if i'm here i push it next step here
 

587
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,430
if i'm here i push it next step here
right but when i'm next step here

and what do we do we should push it
 

783
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,310

append it to the queue

784

append it to the queue
 

785
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,789
