1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,840
hello

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,960
hello mr mister right now you're right

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,399
yeah

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,880
yeah

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,719
so we're given an array so we want to

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,880
find out the increasing subsequence

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,199
increasing

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,600
increasing subsequence

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,080
what's the subsequence

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,720
triplet what's triplet

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,920
three numbers together three numbers

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,880
triple three numbers what's subsequent

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,320
is when you can any way you like

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,239
okay so let's say

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,399
one two three four five what's this how

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,520
many subsequent i mean let's say for the

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,800
triplet subsequently fifteen

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,879
how many of these

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,239
the subsequence of the what subsequence

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,239
by the way

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,399
you can pick from anyone

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,760
yeah subsequence is original this is the

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,640
original way

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,280
and we are allowed to remove

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,039
remove zero or more

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,719
elements from it and the remaining is

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,320
the subsequent for example if i remove

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,439
two and four the remaining is the one

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,280
three five

30
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,360
if i remove one two three the four five

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,439
is the substituent okay so as we can see

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,520
we remove the sum elements for the

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,159
original value

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,479
the remaining is a subsequence the order

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,880
right the relative order between

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,200
two elements do not change

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,799
the surplus on the other hand

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,080
is continuous right remember the sum

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,640
sundays

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
sublist

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,280
or some away sometimes

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,040
something is a separate right one single

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,240
any single animal is a service summary

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,320
and then otherwise we can pick two

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,240
index the left and right for example if

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,640
we pick the first index as

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,119
you know the first index here and the

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,439
second index here and then one to four

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,000
is a subsequent sub list

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,600
yeah two and five into service two and

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,920
four

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,920
okay so listen to me

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,240
is is service

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,840
uh also a subsequence

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
so can i say sundays

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,180
belongs to one of the subsequent is it

57
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,040
true

58
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,120
[Music]

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,840
it's at least true surplus is belongs to

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,400
subsequent

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,520
[Music]

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
yeah

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,040
yeah yeah of course this is true right

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,800
because subways you know

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,640
is also subsequent right okay

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,959
okay

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,680
what you doing

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,920
nothing stops okay so now please we want

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,840
to find out the three numbers

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,480
triplets right three numbers three

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,760
numbers and then they need to be

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,319
increasing okay so for example if this

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,920
is this true like we can find a triplet

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:59,280
which is increasing in this array

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,840
uh one two three yeah obviously or two

76
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,959
three five or one four five oh you know

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,360
and every sub uh every triplet

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,080
subsequent subsequent triplet

79
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,239
is increasing so that's true okay and

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
how about i write another one on the

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,800
other hand which is

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,360
five four three two one

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,560
can you find us increasing subsequent

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
trip in this array

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,599
uh

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,239
um no

87
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,599
no okay that's good because that none

88
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,959
you can't find anything that's already

89
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,840
stand for

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,840
okay

91
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,319
no

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,879
okay so what's your approach to solving

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,879
this problem

94
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,159
what's the approach of solving this

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,159
problem it's like he

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,439
what can we do about it

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,439
what can we do about it

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,959
through

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,959
rufus and yes we can prove

100
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,720
what's the time complexity if we want to

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,720
prove for the triplets

102
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,959
come on keyboard okay

103
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,059
[Music]

104
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,560
if we want the blue force

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,639
uh

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,080
what's what's the what's the name of

107
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,680
four numbers together

108
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,600
called jupiter yeah what's the temporary

109
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,919
thing oh

110
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,759
four to the power yeah you got it so how

111
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,600
can we prove us this one look we can do

112
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,600
this for i

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,720
in range m n is the number of the

114
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,240
the number of numbers yeah and then for

115
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,120
j can i not hear the noise please okay

116
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,680
in range we start from i

117
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,759
i cross one to n

118
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,000
and then for k

119
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,960
in ranges okay and then j plus 1 to n

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
right

121
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,600
so in this case look i is smaller than j

122
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,800
j is smaller than k and we just have to

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,960
check if

124
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,840
nums

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,880
i smaller than num j

126
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,520
smaller than numbers k okay

127
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,800
and then we return to why

128
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,720
easy right yes otherwise

129
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,960
yeah

130
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,960
is it

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,759
you understand do you understand why

132
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,639
this is i plus one start from i plus one

133
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,600
y k start from j j plus one so why are

134
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,360
we look i from zero to n minus one but

135
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,360
why j is from i plus one y k is from j

136
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,319
plus one

137
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,639
it's because um

138
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,199
we want to make sure what we

139
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,800
want to make sure that it's a triplet

140
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,680
and three and like in order

141
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,240
we only make sure i index i the numbers

142
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,199
are one at each other right i j k and

143
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,600
then these is the increasing okay

144
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,039
obviously this is very slow right yeah

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,720
yeah

146
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,840
so look what's the

147
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,240
so can we improve i mean can we improve

148
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,800
yeah obviously yeah otherwise there is

149
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,800
no point of doing this lesson right so

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,520
we want to improve this

151
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,319
so

152
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,600
what's the if if we can find the first

153
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,360
two numbers

154
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
right if let's say i can find two

155
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,120
numbers first two numbers okay two

156
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,800
two numbers

157
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,880
the smallest two numbers we found so far

158
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,919
which are increasing

159
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,080
so look i have i've look if i know one

160
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,840
three

161
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,520
is the

162
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,599
you know it's the first two number and

163
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,759
then i can just check if four is bigger

164
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,280
than both of them then it's true right

165
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,880
all right yeah so look if i know let's

166
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,120
say an another

167
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
less obvious example like

168
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,560
one zero

169
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,800
four

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,800
two

171
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,319
uh maybe let's say one zero

172
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,759
one two

173
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,960
uh zero

174
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,199
four

175
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,759
zero five okay can you find the

176
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,759
increasing subsequence uh stripless here

177
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,400
uh

178
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,919
is

179
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,599
are you sure it's very obvious

180
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,039
it's very obvious

181
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,639
can you find some number which are

182
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,080
increasing

183
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,160
um

184
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,520
[Music]

185
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,000
come on keep keep looking it's there

186
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,960
thirty four

187
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,840
zero two four yes all two four five okay

188
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,240
or one four five okay yeah

189
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,000
okay so now minus one

190
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,560
minus one zero

191
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,639
four yeah yeah many so look so let's say

192
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,319
i have to look at one one

193
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,720
and then this number is smaller than

194
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,240
that so now becomes zero so i have

195
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,199
smaller zero

196
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,280
zero minus one no okay so minus one yeah

197
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,160
minus one two okay

198
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,800
right so now 0 bigger than both no

199
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,360
because 0 is bigger than 1

200
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,479
uh bigger than 2 so i replace 2 with 0

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,440
so it's minus 1 0 okay then 4

202
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,320
4 is bigger than both minus 1 and 0 so i

203
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,839
return true right yeah so the key point

204
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,720
is i i keep tracking of the first two

205
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,600
numbers in order so i keep tracking look

206
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,920
look

207
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,399
okay let's say

208
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,959
let's say a equals infinity at the

209
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,839
beginning b equals infinity okay so how

210
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,839
do we get it look

211
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,080
one is smaller than infinity so i change

212
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,080
this to one

213
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:14,720
yeah zero is this smaller than one

214
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,040
yeah yeah so i change this to zero

215
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,519
minus one is it smaller than zero yeah

216
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,480
okay i change this to minus one

217
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,880
two is smaller than minus one

218
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,760
nine is it two smaller than infinity

219
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,560
yeah i change this to two okay so i have

220
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,480
one minus one two here all right

221
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,839
zero is this smaller than

222
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,760
minus one nine is it smaller than two

223
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,320
yes yes so i replace these two with the

224
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,399
other so now the the subsequence first

225
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,200
two is minus one zero yeah

226
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,360
four is it smaller than minus one

227
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,120
nine smaller than zero

228
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,279
what does it mean if it's not smaller

229
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,959
than a it's not smaller than b what does

230
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,399
it mean

231
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,680
yeah we can put it on that it's bigger

232
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,480
than a and b

233
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,320
a b here right so if it's not smaller

234
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,160
than a it's not smaller than b so it's

235
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,600
somewhere here so we find that

236
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,399
increasing substance

237
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,079
yeah

238
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,320
so this is one zero four minus one zero

239
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,000
minus one zero four yeah you see get get

240
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,920
it get it look

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,920
is it smaller than a

242
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,839
no is it smaller than b

243
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,839
no so where is it it's here

244
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,920
so a is smaller than b all right a is

245
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,519
smaller than b and it's somewhere here

246
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,680
so we find the c here

247
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,600
we can chew so what's the time what's

248
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,839
the time complexity

249
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,839
exactly what's the space for west b

250
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,120
are we using under additional in your

251
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,600
space no

252
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,600
what's that

253
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,519
it's better than this one right

254
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,600
obviously

255
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,079
okay so let's quickly write this and

256
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,079
then we'll be

257
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,160
okay can you tell me okay define

258
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,160
increasing

259
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,600
triplet

260
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,160
subsequent you know sometimes we use the

261
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,959
triplet you know you know like the twins

262
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,760
yeah yeah the two look the same right

263
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,240
yeah the triplets three

264
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,320
three kids look the same that's also

265
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,760
called triplet yeah

266
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,600
got it

267
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,560
so n okay let's say numbers here

268
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,839
not n equals the length of the numbers

269
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,399
yeah

270
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,160
and at the beginning a equals b equals

271
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,240
the biggest number you can think of

272
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,040
which is what infinite

273
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,800
mass dot infinity

274
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,320
and now we can go through the number

275
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,839
actually we don't need to

276
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,760
like this we just can go through the

277
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,200
numbers for i in numbers

278
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,279
if

279
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,240
i is smaller or equal a

280
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,240
come on are you okay

281
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,800
if i

282
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,040
if i is smaller or equal than a what

283
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,880
should we do

284
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,240
if i is smaller or equal than a what

285
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,480
should we do

286
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,480
um

287
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,480
a a

288
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,760
yeah and ask

289
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,839
a if

290
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,839
i is smaller than equal to b what do we

291
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,839
do
