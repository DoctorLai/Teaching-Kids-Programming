er today look yeah
 

241
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,230
er today look yeah
we find we go through look if they are

242
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
we find we go through look if they are
 

243
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,350
we find we go through look if they are
if they are n strings in the first place

244
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
if they are n strings in the first place
 

245
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,790
if they are n strings in the first place
and if they are m string in the second

246
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
and if they are m string in the second
 

247
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,590
and if they are m string in the second
base

248
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
base
 

249
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,710
base
okay and if the first first string the

250
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
okay and if the first first string the
 

251
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,189
okay and if the first first string the
length

252
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
length
 

253
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,469
length
is uh the average length i'm talking

254
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
is uh the average length i'm talking
 

255
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,390
is uh the average length i'm talking
about the average length okay so if

256
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
about the average length okay so if
 

257
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,909
about the average length okay so if
let's say uh t

258
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
let's say uh t
 

259
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,790
let's say uh t
and the second lens will be u then the

260
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
and the second lens will be u then the
 

261
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,909
and the second lens will be u then the
average okay

262
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
average okay
 

263
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,950
average okay
so now for each one you need to you need

264
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
so now for each one you need to you need
 

265
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,430
so now for each one you need to you need
to go

266
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
to go
 

267
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,029
to go
through this list right and t yeah

268
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
through this list right and t yeah
 

269
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,430
through this list right and t yeah
to find out if it's a prefix all right

270
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
to find out if it's a prefix all right
 

271
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,070
to find out if it's a prefix all right
yes

272
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
yes
 

273
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,670
yes
so the complexity is what look

274
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
so the complexity is what look
 

275
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,790
so the complexity is what look
they are m right m

276
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
they are m right m
 

277
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,309
they are m right m
yes and you need to search for n times

278
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
yes and you need to search for n times
 

279
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,230
yes and you need to search for n times
right yes all right

280
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
right yes all right
 

281
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,590
right yes all right
times n times and then each one

282
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
times n times and then each one
 

283
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,790
times n times and then each one
you need to you need to search what for

284
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
you need to you need to search what for
 

285
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,150
you need to you need to search what for
each one

286
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
each one
 

287
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,189
each one
you need to test if

288
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
you need to test if
 

289
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,230
you need to test if
if the if this is the prefix of that

290
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
if the if this is the prefix of that
 

291
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,469
if the if this is the prefix of that
right so you need to test what we how

292
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
right so you need to test what we how
 

293
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,749
right so you need to test what we how
many times if that you

294
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
many times if that you
 

295
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,710
many times if that you
you average you let the length of you

296
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
you average you let the length of you
 

297
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,430
you average you let the length of you
okay

298
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
okay
 

299
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,629
okay
then you need to test times you so this

300
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
then you need to test times you so this
 

301
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,790
then you need to test times you so this
is the complexity okay

302
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
is the complexity okay
 

303
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,909
is the complexity okay
got it yeah yeah because there are

304
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
got it yeah yeah because there are
 

305
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,390
got it yeah yeah because there are
m strings and then for each one i need

306
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
m strings and then for each one i need
 

307
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,029
m strings and then for each one i need
to test

308
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
to test
 

309
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,270
to test
any string and for each one because i

310
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
any string and for each one because i
 

311
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,309
any string and for each one because i
use m

312
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
use m
 

313
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,990
use m
o n or u a lot yeah yeah

314
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
o n or u a lot yeah yeah
 

315
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,909
o n or u a lot yeah yeah
yeah that's complexity and the u is the

316
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
yeah that's complexity and the u is the
 

317
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,830
yeah that's complexity and the u is the
side is the size of these for example

318
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
side is the size of these for example
 

319
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,710
side is the size of these for example
they are all

320
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
they are all
 

321
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,350
they are all
size two for example okay size two okay

322
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
size two for example okay size two okay
 

323
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,990
size two for example okay size two okay
so look

324
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
so look
 

325
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,710
so look
this is one two three four five four

326
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
this is one two three four five four
 

327
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,270
this is one two three four five four
times

328
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
times
 

329
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,790
times
one two three four four times what two

330
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
one two three four four times what two
 

331
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,070
one two three four four times what two
so like how many times 32 times got it

332
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
so like how many times 32 times got it
 

333
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,909
so like how many times 32 times got it
you need for computer you need to

334
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
you need for computer you need to
 

335
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,749
you need for computer you need to
compare 32 times

336
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
compare 32 times
 

337
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,790
compare 32 times
got it yes can we do better

338
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
got it yes can we do better
 

339
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,430
got it yes can we do better
that's the beauty of a try so we can we

340
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
that's the beauty of a try so we can we
 

341
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,990
that's the beauty of a try so we can we
can be

342
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
can be
 

343
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,309
can be
we can be it has more letters than that

344
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
we can be it has more letters than that
 

345
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,670
we can be it has more letters than that
it's not it's a look

346
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
it's not it's a look
 

347
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,469
it's not it's a look
we are we are checking the prefix okay

348
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
we are we are checking the prefix okay
 

349
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,430
we are we are checking the prefix okay
if we are

350
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
if we are
 

351
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,629
if we are
unsufficient yeah if suffix is similar

352
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
unsufficient yeah if suffix is similar
 

353
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,870
unsufficient yeah if suffix is similar
if we are not checking prefix if we are

354
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
if we are not checking prefix if we are
 

355
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,189
if we are not checking prefix if we are
going to find out how many of these

356
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
going to find out how many of these
 

357
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,309
going to find out how many of these
strings are in the in the

358
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
strings are in the in the
 

359
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,270
strings are in the in the
in this dictionary so can we do better

360
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
in this dictionary so can we do better
 

361
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,830
in this dictionary so can we do better
we can

362
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
we can
 

363
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,150
we can
obviously do better because we can use a

364
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
obviously do better because we can use a
 

365
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,950
obviously do better because we can use a
notebook

366
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
notebook
 

367
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,990
notebook
right we remember these

368
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
right we remember these
 

369
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,189
right we remember these
words in the notebook right got it and

370
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
words in the notebook right got it and
 

371
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,029
words in the notebook right got it and
then we just need to

372
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
then we just need to
 

373
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,110
then we just need to
go through these m times

374
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
go through these m times
 

375
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,909
go through these m times
right and then look because there are

376
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
right and then look because there are
 

377
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,990
right and then look because there are
you can

378
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
you can
 

379
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,270
you can
supposed to be together no there are

380
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
supposed to be together no there are
 

381
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,430
supposed to be together no there are
different forwards for dictionaries so

382
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
different forwards for dictionaries so
 

383
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,550
different forwards for dictionaries so
i'm asking

384
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
i'm asking
 

385
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,950
i'm asking
how many of these characters how many of

386
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
how many of these characters how many of
 

387
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,830
how many of these characters how many of
these strings

388
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
these strings
 

389
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,710
these strings
appear in here so it's not perfect

390
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
appear in here so it's not perfect
 

391
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,189
appear in here so it's not perfect
enough

392
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
enough
 

393
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,150
enough
then we can record the words in a

394
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
then we can record the words in a
 

395
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,430
then we can record the words in a
notebook

396
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
notebook
 

397
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,790
notebook
right and then

398
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
right and then
 

399
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,670
right and then
we can just look it up so so the the

400
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
we can just look it up so so the the
 

401
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,469
we can just look it up so so the the
timing

402
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
timing
 

403
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,790
timing
would be these will be removed so the

404
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
would be these will be removed so the
 

405
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,909
would be these will be removed so the
timing will appear

406
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
timing will appear
 

407
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,990
timing will appear
because it needs to if there are new

408
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
because it needs to if there are new
 

409
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,190
because it needs to if there are new
characters for each one

410
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
characters for each one
 

411
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,990
characters for each one
it needs the u times to calculate the

412
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
it needs the u times to calculate the
 

413
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,469
it needs the u times to calculate the
key

414
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
key
 

415
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,149
key
hash key and i'm looking for so you know

416
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
hash key and i'm looking for so you know
 

417
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,909
hash key and i'm looking for so you know
when we're looking for the notebook we

418
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
when we're looking for the notebook we
 

419
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,509
when we're looking for the notebook we
need to hash it we need to

420
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
need to hash it we need to
 

421
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,269
need to hash it we need to
have a key right so this key function

422
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
have a key right so this key function
 

423
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,310
have a key right so this key function
key function of this string like uh a

424
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
key function of this string like uh a
 

425
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,829
key function of this string like uh a
string

426
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
string
 

427
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,070
string
you know and this will give me a key and

428
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
you know and this will give me a key and
 

429
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,710
you know and this will give me a key and
then i i go to this dictionary

430
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
then i i go to this dictionary
 

431
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,949
then i i go to this dictionary
go to the notebook to find out if

432
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
go to the notebook to find out if
 

433
00:08:58,959 --> 00:08:59,990
go to the notebook to find out if
there's a if

434
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
there's a if
 

435
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,350
there's a if
there's a an entry can be

436
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
there's a an entry can be
 

437
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,310
there's a an entry can be
can be opened by this key okay so it's a

438
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
can be opened by this key okay so it's a
 

439
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,350
can be opened by this key okay so it's a
one time

440
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
one time
 

441
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,509
one time
a one-time lookup but for to calculate

442
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
a one-time lookup but for to calculate
 

443
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,430
a one-time lookup but for to calculate
the key because there are new characters

444
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
the key because there are new characters
 

445
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,110
the key because there are new characters
for each each string

446
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
for each each string
 

447
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,430
for each each string
then it needs to owe you time to

448
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
then it needs to owe you time to
 

449
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,310
then it needs to owe you time to
calculate the key

450
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
calculate the key
 

451
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,230
calculate the key
okay got it let's find the complexity

452
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
okay got it let's find the complexity
 

453
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,350
okay got it let's find the complexity
with the hash book

454
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
with the hash book
 

455
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,750
with the hash book
if you are looking for the words in the

456
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
if you are looking for the words in the
 

457
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,230
if you are looking for the words in the
dictionary is omu okay

458
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
dictionary is omu okay
 

459
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,670
dictionary is omu okay
but now we're talking about different

460
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
but now we're talking about different
 

461
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,910
but now we're talking about different
problems which is the prefix prefix if

462
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
problems which is the prefix prefix if
 

463
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,910
problems which is the prefix prefix if
you are you're going to list the

464
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
you are you're going to list the
 

465
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,110
you are you're going to list the
profile search is all m times n times u

466
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
profile search is all m times n times u
 

467
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,750
profile search is all m times n times u
right

468
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
right
 

469
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,269
right
right let me repeat for each they are m

470
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
right let me repeat for each they are m
 

471
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,750
right let me repeat for each they are m
string

472
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
string
 

473
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,070
string
you need to end string right and you

474
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
you need to end string right and you
 

475
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,350
you need to end string right and you
need to look it for

476
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
need to look it for
 

477
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,990
need to look it for
in the end string right for each one you

478
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
in the end string right for each one you
 

479
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,550
in the end string right for each one you
need to

480
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
need to
 

481
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,389
need to
check you characters right you need to

482
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
check you characters right you need to
 

483
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,590
check you characters right you need to
check your characters

484
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
check your characters
 

485
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,470
check your characters
for example look er right and i need to

486
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
for example look er right and i need to
 

487
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,110
for example look er right and i need to
check here

488
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
check here
 

489
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,230
check here
okay e r okay then it's a prefix okay

490
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
okay e r okay then it's a prefix okay
 

491
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,470
okay e r okay then it's a prefix okay
right okay if this is not arrogant then

492
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
right okay if this is not arrogant then
 

493
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,150
right okay if this is not arrogant then
if this is ms

494
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
if this is ms
 

495
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,670
if this is ms
okay m not equal like next one

496
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
okay m not equal like next one
 

497
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,870
okay m not equal like next one
m not equal m equal but u is not equal

498
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
m not equal m equal but u is not equal
 

499
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,750
m not equal m equal but u is not equal
then it jumps

500
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
then it jumps
 

501
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,790
then it jumps
so that's n times n times u okay

502
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
so that's n times n times u okay
 

503
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,870
so that's n times n times u okay
yes so the three let's try we

504
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
yes so the three let's try we
 

505
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,269
yes so the three let's try we
come back to the concept try why we need

506
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
come back to the concept try why we need
 

507
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,670
come back to the concept try why we need
to try

508
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
to try
 

509
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,710
to try
why we need to try we built it look so

510
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
why we need to try we built it look so
 

511
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,509
why we need to try we built it look so
look here

512
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
look here
 

513
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,350
look here
this is an uh look

514
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
this is an uh look
 

515
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,110
this is an uh look
this e-i-e-i-c so we built a tree look

516
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
this e-i-e-i-c so we built a tree look
 

517
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,230
this e-i-e-i-c so we built a tree look
this is the root okay empty okay

518
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
this is the root okay empty okay
 

519
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,590
this is the root okay empty okay
this is empty okay and then i e

520
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
this is empty okay and then i e
 

521
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,480
this is empty okay and then i e
so i have an e here ah

522
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:39,490
so i have an e here ah
 

523
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,750
so i have an e here ah
[Music]

524
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760

 

525
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,269

c e i z

526
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279

 

527
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,389

nothing starting point nothing a dude we

528
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
nothing starting point nothing a dude we
 

529
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:52,949
nothing starting point nothing a dude we
call it

530
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
call it
 

531
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,630
call it
okay and then r e r i c okay

532
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
okay and then r e r i c okay
 

533
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,710
okay and then r e r i c okay
so okay and then now ah

534
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
so okay and then now ah
 

535
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,990
so okay and then now ah
why so basically it's a tree like

536
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
why so basically it's a tree like
 

537
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,670
why so basically it's a tree like
this is a dictionary right hey

538
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680

 

539
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,069

okay okay maybe i have another one

540
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
okay okay maybe i have another one
 

541
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,350
okay okay maybe i have another one
say the red uh

542
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
say the red uh
 

543
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,470
say the red uh
red okay red okay just to compare red so

544
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
red okay red okay just to compare red so
 

545
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,590
red okay red okay just to compare red so
what will happen

546
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
what will happen
 

547
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,110
what will happen
ah e

548
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120

 

549
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:37,829

d okay okay

550
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839

 

551
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,030

this is a tree remember the tree

552
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
this is a tree remember the tree
 

553
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,030
this is a tree remember the tree
it's not fine on the tree remember but

554
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
it's not fine on the tree remember but
 

555
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,190
it's not fine on the tree remember but
it has many many many characters it's

556
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
it has many many many characters it's
 

557
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,310
it has many many many characters it's
the prefix

558
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
the prefix
 

559
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,350
the prefix
got it this is a loot upside down a tree

560
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
got it this is a loot upside down a tree
 

561
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,590
got it this is a loot upside down a tree
okay prefecture mommy it could be

562
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
okay prefecture mommy it could be
 

563
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:03,990
okay prefecture mommy it could be
okay mommy mom

564
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000

 

565
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,509

another one uh let's say uh

566
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
another one uh let's say uh
 

567
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,470
another one uh let's say uh
ethan okay for the eastern i got e here

568
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
ethan okay for the eastern i got e here
 

569
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,190
ethan okay for the eastern i got e here
so

570
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
so
 

571
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,190
so
egg oh okay

572
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200

 

573
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,710

okay so basically we use this

574
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
okay so basically we use this
 

575
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,350
okay so basically we use this
three data structure to recall a tree

576
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
three data structure to recall a tree
 

577
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,310
three data structure to recall a tree
right

578
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
right
 

579
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,350
right
so how does this have i

580
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360
so how does this have i
 

581
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,430
so how does this have i
let me build this build building and

582
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
let me build this build building and
 

583
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,190
let me build this build building and
then i can look i want to look for the

584
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
then i can look i want to look for the
 

585
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,750
then i can look i want to look for the
prefix

586
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
prefix
 

587
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,110
prefix
e i got e yeah

588
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
e i got e yeah
 

589
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,990
e i got e yeah
ah i got the r okay so this is the

590
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
ah i got the r okay so this is the
 

591
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,590
ah i got the r okay so this is the
prefix

592
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
prefix
 

593
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,590
prefix
okay so the length is remember the

594
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
okay so the length is remember the
 

595
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,430
okay so the length is remember the
length is you okay the length is

596
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,440
length is you okay the length is
 

597
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,030
length is you okay the length is
you know the height of the tree is u

598
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
you know the height of the tree is u
 

599
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,190
you know the height of the tree is u
right and then

600
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
right and then
 

601
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,790
right and then
r y yes

602
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
r y yes
 

603
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,150
r y yes
m s it doesn't have s

604
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
m s it doesn't have s
 

605
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,190
m s it doesn't have s
okay it doesn't have s so s is none

606
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200
okay it doesn't have s so s is none
 

607
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,230
okay it doesn't have s so s is none
here none so this is not t

608
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
here none so this is not t
 

609
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,350
here none so this is not t
it doesn't have t t in

610
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
it doesn't have t t in
 

611
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,710
it doesn't have t t in
d c doesn't have c okay so what's the

612
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
d c doesn't have c okay so what's the
 

613
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,710
d c doesn't have c okay so what's the
time complexity how about c

614
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
time complexity how about c
 

615
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,389
time complexity how about c
i i n times n

616
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
i i n times n
 

617
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,030
i i n times n
times u look this is m characters yeah

618
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
times u look this is m characters yeah
 

619
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,150
times u look this is m characters yeah
and then the length of the is

620
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
and then the length of the is
 

621
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,870
and then the length of the is
so what's the term complexity oh and

622
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
so what's the term complexity oh and
 

623
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,470
so what's the term complexity oh and
something

624
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,480

 

625
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,509

it definitely wins something oh and what

626
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
it definitely wins something oh and what
 

627
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,590
it definitely wins something oh and what
let's how many u o and u right

628
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
let's how many u o and u right
 

629
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,389
let's how many u o and u right
yeah look at this is the same as the

630
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
yeah look at this is the same as the
 

631
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,190
yeah look at this is the same as the
very tiny efficiency

632
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
very tiny efficiency
 

633
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,310
very tiny efficiency
remember the first approach we look for

634
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
remember the first approach we look for
 

635
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,350
remember the first approach we look for
the first one yeah

636
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
the first one yeah
 

637
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,910
the first one yeah
remember it needs how many times times

638
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
remember it needs how many times times
 

639
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,670
remember it needs how many times times
another m here right

640
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
another m here right
 

641
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,230
another m here right
yeah so we basically reducing the time

642
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,240
yeah so we basically reducing the time
 

643
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,670
yeah so we basically reducing the time
contaxion from l

644
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
contaxion from l
 

645
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,790
contaxion from l
n times n times u to o

646
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
n times n times u to o
 

647
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,430
n times n times u to o
and u so which is better which is better

648
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
and u so which is better which is better
 

649
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,269
and u so which is better which is better
this one the less the better yeah

650
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
this one the less the better yeah
 

651
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,470
this one the less the better yeah
because look it needs

652
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
because look it needs
 

653
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,790
because look it needs
this much of time but now we're reducing

654
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
this much of time but now we're reducing
 

655
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,750
this much of time but now we're reducing
it

656
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
it
 

657
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,990
it
yeah we need we need just a new time

658
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000
yeah we need we need just a new time
 

659
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,870
yeah we need we need just a new time
because we

660
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
because we
 

661
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,670
because we
we can look it up in a try prefix tree

662
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
we can look it up in a try prefix tree
 

663
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,389
we can look it up in a try prefix tree
right

664
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
right
 

665
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,910
right
do you see the beauty of it right yeah

666
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
do you see the beauty of it right yeah
 

667
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,629
do you see the beauty of it right yeah
yeah look i want to check if ms is in

668
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
yeah look i want to check if ms is in
 

669
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,269
yeah look i want to check if ms is in
the in

670
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
the in
 

671
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,269
the in
in the in the prefix of any of these

672
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
in the in the prefix of any of these
 

673
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,269
in the in the prefix of any of these
words right previously i need to go

674
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
words right previously i need to go
 

675
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,710
words right previously i need to go
through each one right

676
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
through each one right
 

677
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,829
through each one right
yeah and this is m times c yeah

678
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
yeah and this is m times c yeah
 

679
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,629
yeah and this is m times c yeah
y yeah now i don't because i have at

680
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
y yeah now i don't because i have at
 

681
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,990
y yeah now i don't because i have at
least tried three

682
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
least tried three
 

683
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,110
least tried three
then i can look it up okay if the root

684
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
then i can look it up okay if the root
 

685
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,470
then i can look it up okay if the root
next one does it have a ah m

686
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
next one does it have a ah m
 

687
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,949
next one does it have a ah m
yes we have n and i go to m does it have

688
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
yes we have n and i go to m does it have
 

689
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:39,509
yes we have n and i go to m does it have
a

690
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519
a
 

691
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,870
a
s no i don't have s so i return fourth

692
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:42,880
s no i don't have s so i return fourth
 

693
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,310
s no i don't have s so i return fourth
okay yeah so how

694
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
okay yeah so how
 

695
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,350
okay yeah so how
then now we can implement this define

696
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
then now we can implement this define
 

697
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,710
then now we can implement this define
yeah define yeah

698
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
yeah define yeah
 

699
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,829
yeah define yeah
look the surface so how can we find this

700
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:55,839
look the surface so how can we find this
 

701
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,790
look the surface so how can we find this
service

702
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
service
 

703
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,509
service
remember eric if if we are looking for

704
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
remember eric if if we are looking for
 

705
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,269
remember eric if if we are looking for
the if any

706
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
the if any
 

707
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,629
the if any
i i give you a question this is to

708
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
i i give you a question this is to
 

709
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,590
i i give you a question this is to
fear the prefix and how about if we want

710
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
fear the prefix and how about if we want
 

711
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,470
fear the prefix and how about if we want
to find the surface

712
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
to find the surface
 

713
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,470
to find the surface
do we still can you can we still use

714
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
do we still can you can we still use
 

715
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,230
do we still can you can we still use
this try

716
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
this try
 

717
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,470
this try
if we want to build a cervix all right

718
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
if we want to build a cervix all right
 

719
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,310
if we want to build a cervix all right
can we check for example if i want to

720
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
can we check for example if i want to
 

721
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,590
can we check for example if i want to
check ic i have

722
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
check ic i have
 

723
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,949
check ic i have
ic here i see here

724
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
ic here i see here
 

725
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,389
ic here i see here
this is the surface can we how can we

726
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
this is the surface can we how can we
 

727
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,430
this is the surface can we how can we
feel this

728
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
feel this
 

729
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,110
feel this
tree uh try how can we build this try so

730
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
tree uh try how can we build this try so
 

731
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,949
tree uh try how can we build this try so
we can look it up like

732
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
we can look it up like
 

733
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,749
we can look it up like
you are you just turn it upside down

734
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
you are you just turn it upside down
 

735
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,629
you are you just turn it upside down
turn it upside

736
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
turn it upside
 

737
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,150
turn it upside
quite close not exactly this is a choice

738
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
quite close not exactly this is a choice
 

739
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,350
quite close not exactly this is a choice
you come upside down but we can

740
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
you come upside down but we can
 

741
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,430
you come upside down but we can
live upside down no no no what we can do

742
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
live upside down no no no what we can do
 

743
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,629
live upside down no no no what we can do
is what we reverse this

744
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
is what we reverse this
 

745
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,749
is what we reverse this
yeah so we can reverse this then we put

746
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
yeah so we can reverse this then we put
 

747
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,629
yeah so we can reverse this then we put
it there that would be

748
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
it there that would be
 

749
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,990
it there that would be
c i r e right

750
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
c i r e right
 

751
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,870
c i r e right
and then we're looking up even if i see

752
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
and then we're looking up even if i see
 

753
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,110
and then we're looking up even if i see
if

754
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
if
 

755
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,670
if
i c is a suffix then we just look it up

756
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
i c is a suffix then we just look it up
 

757
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,310
i c is a suffix then we just look it up
if c i

758
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
if c i
 

759
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,509
if c i
then look ci is here so you see

760
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
then look ci is here so you see
 

761
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,910
then look ci is here so you see
look at it when we want to check the

762
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
look at it when we want to check the
 

763
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,790
look at it when we want to check the
surface

764
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
surface
 

765
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,150
surface
we reverse these words and build a try

766
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
we reverse these words and build a try
 

767
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,829
we reverse these words and build a try
in reverse order so you'll be c-i-r-e

768
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
in reverse order so you'll be c-i-r-e
 

769
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,670
in reverse order so you'll be c-i-r-e
and now we will want to check if there's

770
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
and now we will want to check if there's
 

771
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,509
and now we will want to check if there's
a surface ic

772
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
a surface ic
 

773
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,150
a surface ic
we reverse this becomes ci then we can

774
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
we reverse this becomes ci then we can
 

775
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,350
we reverse this becomes ci then we can
find c

776
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
find c
 

777
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,389
find c
i okay so laser surface do you

778
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
i okay so laser surface do you
 

779
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,189
i okay so laser surface do you
understand

780
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
understand
 

781
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,310
understand
yeah okay so now this this is so try

782
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,320
yeah okay so now this this is so try
 

783
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,990
yeah okay so now this this is so try
it's better to

784
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
it's better to
 

785
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,949
it's better to
eat so actually it's called prefix tree

786
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
eat so actually it's called prefix tree
 

787
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,110
eat so actually it's called prefix tree
but you can also call it surface tree

788
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
but you can also call it surface tree
 

789
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,150
but you can also call it surface tree
you know you can

790
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
you know you can
 

791
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,189
you know you can
make surface tree

792
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
make surface tree
 

793
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:53,430
make surface tree
become a prefix okay yeah do you get it

794
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440

 

795
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,100

sorry listen funny

796
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,110

 

797
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,470

[Music]

798
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:00,480
[Music]
 

799
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,749
[Music]
first thing first off q yeah but the

800
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759
first thing first off q yeah but the
 

801
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,429
first thing first off q yeah but the
dry one it's a tree it's not it's a tree

802
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
dry one it's a tree it's not it's a tree
 

803
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:07,750
dry one it's a tree it's not it's a tree
so

804
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
so
 

805
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,909
so
it you're going to find a tree yeah this

806
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
it you're going to find a tree yeah this
 

807
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,189
it you're going to find a tree yeah this
tree is

808
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
tree is
 

809
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,909
tree is
this is the prefix or surface tree but

810
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
this is the prefix or surface tree but
 

811
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,110
this is the prefix or surface tree but
we call it try

812
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
we call it try
 

813
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,829
we call it try
with with different notes right now we

814
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
with with different notes right now we
 

815
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,750
with with different notes right now we
look it up it's used to look it up

816
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
look it up it's used to look it up
 

817
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,470
look it up it's used to look it up
look at look at look up a prefix or a

818
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
look at look at look up a prefix or a
 

819
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:22,949
look at look at look up a prefix or a
word

820
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
word
 

821
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,110
word
in a dictionary but usually is the

822
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
in a dictionary but usually is the
 

823
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,549
in a dictionary but usually is the
prefix of surface

824
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:26,559
prefix of surface
 

825
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,110
prefix of surface
because if you we are simply if we

826
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
because if you we are simply if we
 

827
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,230
because if you we are simply if we
simply want to look

828
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240
simply want to look
 

829
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,789
simply want to look
look to find if a word it is an

830
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
look to find if a word it is an
 

831
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,549
look to find if a word it is an
additional what kind of

832
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
additional what kind of
 

833
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,590
additional what kind of
better data structure can we use

834
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600

 

835
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,750

notebook exactly because the notebook is

836
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
notebook exactly because the notebook is
 

837
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,950
notebook exactly because the notebook is
we can just saw the

838
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
we can just saw the
 

839
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,870
we can just saw the
words in the notebook and we can look it

840
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
words in the notebook and we can look it
 

841
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,430
words in the notebook and we can look it
up in constant time right

842
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
up in constant time right
 

843
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,590
up in constant time right
yes okay so now

844
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
yes okay so now
 

845
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,150
yes okay so now
so the brief let's try is better it is

846
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
so the brief let's try is better it is
 

847
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,710
so the brief let's try is better it is
very powerful if it comes to the prefix

848
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
very powerful if it comes to the prefix
 

849
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,430
very powerful if it comes to the prefix
or surface search yeah like the star

850
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
or surface search yeah like the star
 

851
00:17:59,440 --> 00:17:59,750
or surface search yeah like the star
wars

852
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760
wars
 

853
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,950
wars
you know the the python look if this

854
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
you know the the python look if this
 

855
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,669
you know the the python look if this
e-r-i-c if we want to search if

856
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:06,679
e-r-i-c if we want to search if
 

857
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,510
e-r-i-c if we want to search if
e-r-i-e-r-i-c starts with e-r-i

858
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
e-r-i-e-r-i-c starts with e-r-i
 

859
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,870
e-r-i-e-r-i-c starts with e-r-i
then we can do this e-r-i-c

860
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:12,880
then we can do this e-r-i-c
 

861
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,870
then we can do this e-r-i-c
okay this is string and we can use this

862
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
okay this is string and we can use this
 

863
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,750
okay this is string and we can use this
top star

864
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760

 

865
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,270

start with okay

866
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
start with okay
 

867
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,390
start with okay
and then look start with e-r okay

868
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:24,400
and then look start with e-r okay
 

869
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,110
and then look start with e-r okay
this return true okay do you still get

870
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
this return true okay do you still get
 

871
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,070
this return true okay do you still get
it

872
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
it
 

873
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,430
it
and look stars okay this this we can

874
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
and look stars okay this this we can
 

875
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,110
and look stars okay this this we can
choose and then

876
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
choose and then
 

877
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,270
choose and then
and if e t this will return y

878
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
and if e t this will return y
 

879
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,710
and if e t this will return y
e i see that this star is e t

880
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
e i see that this star is e t
 

881
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,750
e i see that this star is e t
then this will return fourth okay okay

882
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
then this will return fourth okay okay
 

883
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,789
then this will return fourth okay okay
return first

884
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799

 

885
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,110

okay now now we're implementing this try

886
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
okay now now we're implementing this try
 

887
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,590
okay now now we're implementing this try
okay

888
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
okay
 

889
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,390
okay
look class class

890
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:55,400
look class class
 

891
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,630
look class class
p-r-i-e class okay this is a try not a

892
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640
p-r-i-e class okay this is a try not a
 

893
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,630
p-r-i-e class okay this is a try not a
note of try

894
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
note of try
 

895
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,150
note of try
column okay and then now define

896
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
column okay and then now define
 

897
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,390
column okay and then now define
and store in underscore and then self

898
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
and store in underscore and then self
 

899
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,510
and store in underscore and then self
let's see and then we can do this

900
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
let's see and then we can do this
 

901
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,430
let's see and then we can do this
self color dot data

902
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,440
self color dot data
 

903
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,669
self color dot data
it's gonna be a lot of writing

904
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679
it's gonna be a lot of writing
 

905
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,870
it's gonna be a lot of writing
dictionary okay

906
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
dictionary okay
 

907
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,510
dictionary okay
because dictionary key value pair okay

908
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
because dictionary key value pair okay
 

909
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,230
because dictionary key value pair okay
key value pair remember key value player

910
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,240
key value pair remember key value player
 

911
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,510
key value pair remember key value player
yeah and we need a ver uh

912
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
yeah and we need a ver uh
 

913
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,549
yeah and we need a ver uh
pulling tuning true or false to to

914
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
pulling tuning true or false to to
 

915
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,669
pulling tuning true or false to to
to say if it's uh ending if the

916
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679
to say if it's uh ending if the
 

917
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,270
to say if it's uh ending if the
if this is the note for a word ending

918
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
if this is the note for a word ending
 

919
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,470
if this is the note for a word ending
like e-i-i-c

920
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,480
like e-i-i-c
 

921
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,830
like e-i-i-c
okay e-r-i-c then what's it guys he got

922
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
okay e-r-i-c then what's it guys he got
 

923
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,590
okay e-r-i-c then what's it guys he got
e r i

924

e r i
 

925
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,909
e r i
c and here this we need to set this to

926
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
c and here this we need to set this to
 

927
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,950
c and here this we need to set this to
true because

928
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960
true because
 

929
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,990
true because
the word a word ends here right

i create a note and put it there i'm

996
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:15,760
i create a note and put it there i'm
 

997
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,720
i create a note and put it there i'm
right

998
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:16,730
right
 

999
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,470

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,630
[Music]
good question very good question look

1002
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
good question very good question look
 

1003
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,590
good question very good question look
then look

1004
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
then look
 

1005
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,630
then look
if i

1006
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
if i
 

1007
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,470
if i
in if i in current

1008
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
in if i in current
 

1009
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,310
in if i in current
dot yeah

1010
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,320

 

1011
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,190

then if it's already e is already here

1012
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200
then if it's already e is already here
 

1013
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,830
then if it's already e is already here
okay if

1014
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840
okay if
 

1015
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,950
okay if
e is already here look then i need to

1016
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
e is already here look then i need to
 

1017
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,390
e is already here look then i need to
this is current i need to move the

1018
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:40,400
this is current i need to move the
 

1019
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,990
this is current i need to move the
current to here right

1020
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
current to here right
 

1021
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,350
current to here right
yeah so that would be current equals

1022
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
yeah so that would be current equals
 

1023
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,390
yeah so that would be current equals
current

1024
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
current
 

1025
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,230
current
dot theta

1026
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
dot theta
 

1027
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,590
dot theta
bracket i right if not

1028
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600
bracket i right if not
 

1029
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,710
bracket i right if not
if not then we need to do this

1030
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,720
if not then we need to do this
 

1031
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,110
if not then we need to do this
current the data

1032
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,120

 

1033
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,549

i equals try create a node

1034
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
i equals try create a node
 

1035
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,549
i equals try create a node
and put it here and put it here right

1036
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
and put it here and put it here right
 

1037
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,990
and put it here and put it here right
look yeah

1038
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,000
look yeah
 

1039
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,990
look yeah
and then i i need to copy this line here

1040
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
and then i i need to copy this line here
 

1041
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,029
and then i i need to copy this line here
right current equals current

1042
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
right current equals current
 

1043
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,070
right current equals current
dot theta i

1044
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
dot theta i
 

1045
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,470
dot theta i
okay so actually you can you can make

1046
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
okay so actually you can you can make
 

1047
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,750
okay so actually you can you can make
this simple array look

1048
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:19,760
this simple array look
 

1049
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,909
this simple array look
you can reverse the logic here you can

1050
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
you can reverse the logic here you can
 

1051
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,110
you can reverse the logic here you can
reverse this logic

1052
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
reverse this logic
 

1053
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,430
reverse this logic
not and then i need to remove this

1054
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
not and then i need to remove this
 

1055
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,750
not and then i need to remove this
and then i can i can i can move this a

1056
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
and then i can i can i can move this a
 

1057
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,270
and then i can i can i can move this a
little bit here okay

1058
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280
little bit here okay
 

1059
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,310
little bit here okay
so this belongs to that this then i

1060
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
so this belongs to that this then i
 

1061
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,110
so this belongs to that this then i
if not in if not here then i create a

1062
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
if not in if not here then i create a
 

1063
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,710
if not in if not here then i create a
node

1064
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
node
 

1065
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,549
node
and i move it to least no i create the

1066
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
and i move it to least no i create the
 

1067
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,070
and i move it to least no i create the
node and move it to here

1068
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080
node and move it to here
 

1069
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,430
node and move it to here
right and after that

1070
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
right and after that
 

1071
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,230
right and after that
the end is what current dot leave

1072
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
the end is what current dot leave
 

1073
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,990
the end is what current dot leave
because we are inserting the e

1074
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
because we are inserting the e
 

1075
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,149
because we are inserting the e
r i c right and then currently equals

1076
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
r i c right and then currently equals
 

1077
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,430
r i c right and then currently equals
what

1078
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
what
 

1079
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,070
what
he was what equals what

1080
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080

 

1081
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,909

this is the two of our two of us

1082
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919

 

1083
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,630

leave now

1084
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,640

 

1085
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,710

yeah we're done we're done okay so

1086
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:12,720
yeah we're done we're done okay so
 

1087
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,710
yeah we're done we're done okay so
that's it let's say answer

1088
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
that's it let's say answer
 

1089
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,630
that's it let's say answer
what's the time complexity of inserting

1090
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
what's the time complexity of inserting
 

1091
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,070
what's the time complexity of inserting
a word if at least

1092
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080

 

1093
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,870

n characters in the world oh when where

1094
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:22,880
n characters in the world oh when where
 

1095
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,350
n characters in the world oh when where
where

1096
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
where
 

1097
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,390
where
what's the space complexity we're done

1098
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
what's the space complexity we're done
 

1099
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,029
what's the space complexity we're done
good job

1100
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:27,039
good job
 

1101
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,070
good job
yeah so this is insane okay now

1102
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
yeah so this is insane okay now
 

1103
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,710
yeah so this is insane okay now
let's implement the search okay

1104
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:34,720
let's implement the search okay
 

1105
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,510
let's implement the search okay
searching will be

1106
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
searching will be
 

1107
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,590
searching will be
similar define search

1108
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
similar define search
 

1109
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,789
similar define search
search self what

1110
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
search self what
 

1111
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,909
search self what
okay say what we are searching the word

1112
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919
okay say what we are searching the word
 

1113
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:46,710
okay say what we are searching the word
okay okay

1114
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:46,720
okay okay
 

1115
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,990
okay okay
it's the same look c you are

1116
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
it's the same look c you are
 

1117
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,390
it's the same look c you are
equal self okay start with the current

1118
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
equal self okay start with the current
 

1119
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,549
equal self okay start with the current
note it's going to be

1120
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
note it's going to be
 

1121
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,470
note it's going to be
for i in what

1122
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,480
for i in what
 

1123
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,590
for i in what
is not i

1124
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:01,600
is not i
 

1125
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,669
is not i
in if it doesn't find enough in the

1126
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:03,679
in if it doesn't find enough in the
 

1127
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,750
in if it doesn't find enough in the
current dot triad what happens

1128
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
current dot triad what happens
 

1129
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,590
current dot triad what happens
what should we return return false yes

1130
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
what should we return return false yes
 

1131
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,430
what should we return return false yes
where we're done okay and what should we

1132
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
where we're done okay and what should we
 

1133
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,110
where we're done okay and what should we
do what should we do

1134
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,120
do what should we do
 

1135
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,710
do what should we do
what should we do we should jump to the

1136
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
what should we do we should jump to the
 

1137
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,630
what should we do we should jump to the
next one yeah so current equals current

1138
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
next one yeah so current equals current
 

1139
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,669
next one yeah so current equals current
dot data i right

1140
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
dot data i right
 

1141
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,230
dot data i right
all right and then here what should we

1142
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
all right and then here what should we
 

1143
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,789
all right and then here what should we
return

1144
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:24,799
return
 

1145
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,110
return
search return one reason why

1146
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
search return one reason why
 

1147
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,950
search return one reason why
current current dollar

1148
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960

 

1149
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,310

search we are searching so

1150
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
search we are searching so
 

1151
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,310
search we are searching so
look we want to search e-i-c yeah

1152
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,320
look we want to search e-i-c yeah
 

1153
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,990
look we want to search e-i-c yeah
yeah here at this point i could be a

1154
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,000
yeah here at this point i could be a
 

1155
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,230
yeah here at this point i could be a
e-i-c-o-e-r-i-c-k

1156
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
e-i-c-o-e-r-i-c-k
 

1157
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,870
e-i-c-o-e-r-i-c-k
for example so what's the difference if

1158
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
for example so what's the difference if
 

1159
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,630
for example so what's the difference if
there's only one e-i-c-k

1160
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
