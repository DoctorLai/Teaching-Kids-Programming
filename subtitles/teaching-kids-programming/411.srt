1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,000
hello

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,760
hello

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,279
okay so today

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,679
today we're going to talk about this

5
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,440
problem okay the eco 2175

6
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,519
767 okay five three consecutive what's

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,480
consecutive numbers

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,720
it means

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,960
can you give me uh three examples of

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,119
three consecutive integers integer you

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,119
know

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
one two yeah one two three okay so it

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,560
adds up to six okay so we are finding we

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
given the number 33 then we want to find

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,719
out if there are three numbers that

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,480
added up to these 33 and these three

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,480
numbers needs to be consecutive so

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,280
they're next to each other right so you

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,640
see

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,840
three things

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,000
and if it can't be made such way so then

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,879
we return this empty array okay and then

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,559
the input is a very huge number

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,239
okay so

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,840
okay so what's your thoughts i mean so

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,840
okay so let's see

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,600
i

28
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,920
mean um

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,080
so yeah so we have a number three

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,920
numbers yes so let's say a okay so

31
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,520
what's this previous number let's say

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,240
let's assume the middle number is a

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,119
what's its previous number a minus one

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,280
yeah and a plus one okay so if you added

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,720
all these together what happened

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,520
how many is

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,240
three yeah because minus one and plus

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,159
one comes out so that's three eighths

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,320
okay so that's three a is equals this

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,159
time let's say we have a tablet so what

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,520
does it mean here

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,439
if these t can be what so what's your

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,520
approach okay

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,400
any idea how do we do it how do we solve

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,560
it

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,240
so let's say okay it's 27 can you find

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,520
the three numbers added up to 27

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,840
consecutive

49
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
um

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,759
come on like nine ten

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,880
okay

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,040
okay okay and then how about

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,560
45

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:02,240
empty probably well not really 45 14 15

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,520
16 yeah 40 50 60.

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,040
okay so what

57
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,040
what can you get from these two

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,360
did examples divide it by three yeah but

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,800
if it can be divided by three then

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
that's the middle number if you can't be

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,840
divided by three like 16 so can we find

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,000
any three numbers yes

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,840
yeah okay so we can just do yeah so

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,959
first of

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,959
all each number can be divided by three

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,440
divided by three then

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,680
it can't be divided by three okay then

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,200
when we just return empty

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,879
yeah and then let's say the middle

70
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,519
number is

71
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,200
number divided by three okay so i'm

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,360
gonna do ten

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,879
meet minus one mid and what's next

74
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,200
minus two

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,879
numbers last one

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,599
i know that's it yeah got it yeah submit

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,200
you see accept it when we passed

78
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,800
yeah what's the time complexity if you

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,480
look at this do we have any dude what's

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
the term complexity so what's the time

81
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,840
complexity

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,599
a one constant where that one

83
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,159
yeah because it's we just do the

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,920
mathematical calculation we can actually

85
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,599
prove us but it's take taking a lot of

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,519
time so let's just comment it out a

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,760
little bit so look at this three cheaper

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,920
quote means the comment uh

89
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,720
multiple lines of code is common okay so

90
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,239
we can just try for from the first we

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,319
improve what's the first number and then

92
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,239
we'll try from one so let's say from

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,720
first in red

94
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,159
so start from one and up to let's say up

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,840
to

96
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,519
meter yeah because they can't go beyond

97
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,519
me though that's not sure yeah

98
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,400
then if first class first plus one

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,120
that's the middle number plus first plus

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,360
two that's the third number equal equal

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,159
number then we do ten

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,560
first number first plus one first plus

103
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,200
two right yeah otherwise we can

104
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,439
empty yeah yeah this is blue force yeah

105
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,599
okay if we click on that look

106
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,439
what happened you take too much time to

107
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,080
run right because it's too slow because

108
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,760
we have to try

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,840
you know a lot of

110
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,680
different options

111
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,519
so i think it's taking time look time

112
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,519
limit excited

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,840
yeah because look when the input number

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,359
is

115
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,440
73 i don't know what's new 376.

116
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,040
okay what how how big is it seven

117
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,240
million

118
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,479
yeah seven minutes 369 000 if this is

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,440
the input then it takes

120
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,120
you know

121
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,120
about half half of it to dry yeah

122
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,560
for the computers just to iterate what's

123
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
the time complexity if you look at this

124
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,560
oh and yes because we just iterating

125
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,360
which is faster look you go wrong

126
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,800
yeah

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,880
okay that's the previous one yeah yeah

128
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,400
yeah that's the previous year okay so

129
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,919
did you get it what have you learned so

130
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,199
far today

131
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,199
about how did they go to record youtube

132
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,000
i think i think the input range look it

133
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,560
says input oh it's zero so it's a same

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,479
yeah so it'll be

135
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,080
okay minus one okay so it's the same

136
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,720
yeah because zero divided by three is

137
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,520
zero the previous one is negative one

138
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
yeah

139
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,680
got it

140
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
oh

141
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,280
this is not right okay so this this this

142
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,120
is not right right

143
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,280
because look we try from the first

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
number so let's say minus one plus zero

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
plus one

146
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,360
uh okay so this blue force is not right

147
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,440
okay because okay good point that's a

148
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,360
that's a very good test cases because

149
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
this this algorithm is not quite right

150
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,240
why is that because the input is you

151
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,160
know it will return empty but

152
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,560
so why is it because we try the first

153
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,639
number right so we try the first number

154
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,479
from zero but

155
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,960
but the first number is negative one

156
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,680
right got it yeah

157
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,759
so we can we need to try try let's say

158
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,319
we need to try

159
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,720
i don't know if because we need to try

160
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,759
from

161
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,800
minus one

162
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,400
the first quick fix is to do this try

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,080
the first one and they will be okay

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
right yeah because the first number

165
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,280
could be minus one right yeah

166
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,280
accents okay

167
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,039
okay that's it for today

168
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,240
bye bye

169
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,240
bye bye
