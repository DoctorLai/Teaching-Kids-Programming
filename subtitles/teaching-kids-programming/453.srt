1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,520
yeah yeah okay so let's say we have a

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,960
container container

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,920
like a container water container yeah

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,559
a vertical lines once again we have a

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,840
few vertical parts what color yes so

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,199
vertical lines

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,359
like that

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,439
so our task is to pick two

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,519
and with these two

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,880
chosen vertical bars

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,119
and we want to find out we want to

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,960
maximize the water like the container

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,719
can hold okay so for example if i pick

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
this one and this one

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,160
right so look let's just look at these

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,879
two lines yeah so if i pour you know pop

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,200
p-o-u-i how do you pronounce this one

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,320
par-4 yeah it means you don't have much

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,879
money no no no not poor p-o-u-i means

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,640
that you pour it in yeah pour the water

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,879
in yeah

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,039
yeah pour the water in and then

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,559
you would be determined by the lower bar

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,520
right because the

25
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,520
the more

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,880
you put the water in moving it and then

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,680
you will always get it towards the other

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,680
the other one will make it worse yep

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,240
yeah it makes sense yeah and you are not

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,320
allowed to slang the slang slang the

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,799
the container yes

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,640
so you put the water in and the volume

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,280
is determined by the lower back it

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,439
doesn't make sense yeah okay so

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,759
so okay another thing is these what

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,119
these wording paths are separate equally

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,680
so we can think of it as system one okay

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,880
so we have given this h away

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,920
actually which is the represent the

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,159
height

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,880
represent the height of each bar and we

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,560
want to maximize we also maximize the

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,880
water by choosing two any two

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,439
i need two vertical paths okay

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,880
yeah so how do we solve this problem you

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,200
know one easy way would be to do what

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,000
if look there are n bars and we want to

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,719
find out two bars so what we can what

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,719
actually can we use

50
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,760
yes that's a very uh obvious thing right

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,239
i'm saying that empath and pass and i'm

52
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,400
going to find out which two right so so

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,480
basically i'm saying is that there are

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,120
anything i want to pick two

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,160
so the how many ways is c

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,879
n two

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,160
means picking two out of n

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,319
okay so

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,000
three apples picking two apples out of

60
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,519
three how many ways

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,560
how many ways

62
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,800
uh

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,640
okay three efforts picking one up how

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,720
many ways three yeah exactly so

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,400
basically it's the same right picking

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,519
picking

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,840
picking

68
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,400
x out of n is equal picking

69
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,160
picking x items out of n is the same is

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,920
picking n minus x out of n right because

71
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,840
because what is mean because look there

72
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,920
are n items yeah if i pick x items and

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,400
this is the same thing as

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,319
picking a minus x items right when we

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
pick one apple

76
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,760
we also get the way of picking two

77
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,080
vectors and vice versa okay

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,760
okay okay come on cn2

79
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,280
cn2 equals n times n minus 1 divided by

80
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,680
two yeah we learned about that in a

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,360
combination right so look obviously look

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,400
this is n square

83
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,040
i'm right

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,920
yeah yeah okay so now we can prove us

85
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,120
let's prove us yeah blue first is very

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,879
useful yeah

87
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,000
but you know what's the time complexity

88
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,400
yeah yeah i'm just writing here

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,200
look at all in square n times n here

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,000
yeah one square so let's do first

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,360
answer at the beginning we hold no water

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,239
which is zero and equals length height

93
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,680
h is the height for each vertical bar

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,959
and then four

95
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,280
the left right the left the bar

96
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,560
the index of the left one

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,319
in range and

98
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,439
okay four

99
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,920
right back in range okay so can you give

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,000
me the parameters for the right bar

101
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,879
the way that come on anybody

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,359
right bar start with one

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,160
the air bar is from zero to n and y bar

104
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,639
is

105
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,960
is what from the

106
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,160
what's the first parameter

107
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,160
what look if i have a determinant

108
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,479
we want to maximize the answer of what

109
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,520
come on can you tell me this

110
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,400
this is very easy yeah okay

111
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,600
okay bye anybody so if i have an air and

112
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,040
r okay so if this is air

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,280
this is air

114
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
this is r okay

115
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,000
so what's what's the volume what's the

116
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,120
volume of if this is air this is the

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,919
height here is h air the height of this

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,160
one is hr so what's that what's the

119
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,400
volume of this what's the volume you

120
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,520
know the volume is the rectangle yeah

121
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,360
what's this bit how much is this

122
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,160
yeah but you don't know which one is

123
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,600
bigger yeah so we picked that one

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,240
yeah i know i'm just giving you an

125
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,400
example of a computer this is the value

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,360
sr so you are basically saying this is

127
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,520
mean

128
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,520
of h air

129
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,919
h r right

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,000
yeah okay so this is this times what

131
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,320
what's this bar

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,639
this is the we know this and then what's

133
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,120
this a one

134
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,120
now a and r is not necessarily separate

135
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,039
by one so what's the distance between a

136
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,280
and f r

137
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,800
well done exactly okay

138
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,280
yeah

139
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,440
okay yeah so look

140
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,440
this is the come on come on ryan what

141
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
you doing so

142
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,800
what i'm saying here is that this is

143
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,759
help this is the volume of the

144
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,039
of the rectangle yeah for this this uh

145
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,319
water if we we chose an iron okay

146
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,720
so this

147
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,600
so you have uh

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,360
so

149
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,880
so yeah the

150
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,160
min or

151
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,440
because

152
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,360
the smaller one is vitamin b

153
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,440
right yeah so

154
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,840
this is the minimum

155
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,039
of these two yeah yeah

156
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,120
and times

157
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,800
times the length of this which is r

158
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,960
minus five we're done

159
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,960
right you get it

160
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,720
okay pull first oh n square okay oh n

161
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,880
squared

162
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,039
it's a bit slow okay but we can do it

163
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,479
better we can use the two pointers see

164
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,560
but how can we do these two points i

165
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,120
think look okay so let's look at this

166
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,199
example yeah if we are air at the

167
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,000
beginning we set it to zero r set it to

168
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,639
n minus one which is the uh you know

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,960
left most and the right mouse if we say

170
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,400
air the height

171
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,319
if we say air is smaller than r right

172
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,360
so how do we move the point we are

173
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,319
supposed to move one right so

174
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,199
is it

175
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,680
is better we move the lower bar or move

176
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,800
the higher bar so now we are we know

177
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,160
that air bar is smaller than the

178
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,000
ah right

179
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,599
so we want to move the

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,599
the answer is we want to move the

181
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,520
shorter part towards the

182
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,680
towards the center right

183
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,360
let's say if we move the bigger one

184
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,400
towards the smaller one what would

185
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,479
happen let's say it might be so tiny

186
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,160
that it might be

187
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,440
that

188
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,000
that it might be only like this

189
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,880
yeah yeah no no look here this is r here

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,960
right

191
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,400
this is longer than air and if we move

192
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,319
here towards the left what will happen

193
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,800
will come like

194
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,319
the lens will be shorter okay so let's

195
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,879
try so let's say

196
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,280
let's see if we

197
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,000
okay so if this is air right so let's

198
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,280
say

199
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,639
currently the volume is mean

200
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,080
air r

201
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,400
times t okay so look this is t okay

202
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,840
let's say this the distance here is t

203
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,720
right if we move the r towards the left

204
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,879
the longer one so let's say if we move

205
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,479
it somewhere here and then the distance

206
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,440
is t1 which is shorter right e1 here t1

207
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,680
and

208
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,960
and the height height is what is mean

209
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,200
l and r1 okay we know we are not sure

210
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,360
how big how tall is r1 right it could be

211
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,399
very tall it could be very small okay so

212
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,039
let's look at this t1 is smaller than t

213
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,200
right smaller or smaller than t right

214
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,040
yeah because it moves towards towards

215
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,120
each other is smaller than the original

216
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:52,399
places but look at this one mean a r

217
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,800
mean a r okay so mean a r and min air

218
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,240
are one okay so look if this is very

219
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,279
tall

220
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,480
r1 is very tall and the min air r1 will

221
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,519
be a right if it's very short

222
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,880
min air r1 is r1 which is smaller than l

223
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,040
so in

224
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,560
in so what does this mean it means that

225
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,080
means

226
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,720
l r1 is always smaller or equal than

227
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,200
mean a r am i right because it's always

228
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,440
determined by the small smaller

229
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,720
by the smaller vertical bar right so

230
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,440
originally

231
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,120
originally the smaller bar is air a and

232
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,080
r right because it's smaller and if we

233
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,440
keep moving to the left right so

234
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,399
so if this r is very tall then

235
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,680
the mean of l and r one is f if this is

236
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,800
very short the mean of air and r1 is r1

237
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,040
r1 is smaller than air yeah so in both

238
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,120
cases the first case is

239
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,760
is equal to air the second case is is

240
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,800
smaller than air right so so that the

241
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,360
volume yeah if we keep moving left we

242
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,000
don't get a better volume am i right

243
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,279
yeah okay so what does it mean look

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,200
if i move a taller bar to towards the

245
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,360
left

246
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,600
we don't get a better choice

247
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,720
right so what does it mean in other

248
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,120
words it means means that we have

249
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,680
we don't need to try

250
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,839
these r right because we know we don't

251
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,320
get better

252
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,320
ah so we don't move it so in that case

253
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,839
we just move the air to the towards to

254
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,519
the right

255
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,519
right because because look if

256
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,200
this thing will get

257
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,000
squishy

258
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,680
in both yeah

259
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,240
at the beginning is on the right on the

260
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,240
right you see they will be

261
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,920
squeezed anyway right they'll be

262
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,560
squeezed they're moving towards each

263
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,560
other i said what did i say if i moved

264
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,800
out towards longer one towards the

265
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,360
shorter one we don't find any choice we

266
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,920
just pull that well on any better one we

267
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,720
saw we just pulled it right so if we

268
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,360
find out if we know already there is no

269
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,320
point there is no better gain if we move

270
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,760
longer towards the center then we just

271
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,240
don't move it right

272
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,279
yeah what's proof of him so we with each

273
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
air

274
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,279
we try each other right

275
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,560
but now i'm playing with this is with

276
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,720
this air we don't find any better choice

277
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,200
than these are the longer one

278
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,480
right because the distance is shorter

279
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,880
right so we we are actually blue forcing

280
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,560
already but we don't and we don't try it

281
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,480
it will be like blue force with some

282
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,240
optimization right

283
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,279
by moving the left to the right what

284
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,120
will happen

285
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,480
we could get something like that right

286
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,200
look

287
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,600
what did there just look

288
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,440
yeah what did they say come on if i move

289
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
the left to the right i could find

290
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,480
something here

291
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,560
and then which

292
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,440
which is longer and what is that how

293
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,160
does that matter the volume will be

294
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,519
potentially bigger do you get it

295
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,079
yeah

296
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,800
this is not a strictly true of the

297
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,399
solution the two-pointer thing okay but

298
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,399
if we want to actually prove it we need

299
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,959
to use the mathematic the contradiction

300
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,639
to do it but this is a little bit out of

301
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,360
scope of this uh

302
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,200
today's talk okay so um

303
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
i'm not going to talk about it so let's

304
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,079
talk about this uh the two pointer thing

305
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,120
okay so air at equals zero

306
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,519
r equals n minus one and equals the

307
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,560
length of the h right the answer at the

308
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,200
beginning would be zero like why look

309
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,839
these two points i think yeah

310
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,680
we talk about the two-pointer thing

311
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
do we still remember we have a look we

312
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,240
have a thoughty number

313
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,120
one three five six nine 11.

314
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,600
once this is the salted numbers yeah

315
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,639
can we find the two numbers added up to

316
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,000
uh to 10

317
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,760
um

318
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,480
[Music]

319
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,560
how do you find the nine one i need my

320
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,560
number ones eric

321
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,160
how do you find nine and one added to

322
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,079
ten

323
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,040
and a on here

324
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,959
and ah here you use two pointers yeah

325
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,600
one one plus eleven twelve come on one

326
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,440
plus 11 12 which is bigger than 10 so

327
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,240
which point which which side should i

328
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,399
move

329
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,120
smaller

330
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,120
right right yeah because it's bigger and

331
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,880
i have to move it to the left yeah okay

332
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,519
so yeah

333
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,920
exactly okay you get it okay this is

334
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,240
probably not a good example let's say do

335
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,040
you find any any

336
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,440
two numbers that add it up to eight

337
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,720
okay so can you simulate this again add

338
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,040
it up to eight

339
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,630
so look one eleven twelve what's your

340
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,440
eyeball

341
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,839
[Music]

342
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,320
never had no right hand so i move

343
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,639
right okay i'm here ten

344
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,440
right right

345
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,399
then

346
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,160
left

347
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,839
yeah because seven is more than an a

348
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,519
right so

349
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,639
wrong nine

350
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,160
right

351
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,240
yeah and then you've got it yes you get

352
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,079
it this is the two point thing right

353
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,760
yeah so now here

354
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,560
why why

355
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,199
left is smaller than r right

356
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,199
answer this is the same we are trying to

357
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,040
maximize our answer

358
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,959
and then there will be mean

359
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,160
of h error

360
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,720
the

361
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,160
the volume that the determined by the

362
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,160
lower part

363
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:27,199
times r minus a right and then look

364
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,040
if h air is smaller or equal to h r

365
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,600
what should we do else what should we do

366
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,760
come on we're talking about if the lower

367
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,000
bar look away

368
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,760
from the air the height is smaller than

369
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,240
one which where we should move hr h is

370
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,199
smaller than r so which one we should we

371
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,920
should move

372
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,240
left left yeah because i was just

373
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,480
talking about that for 10 minutes why

374
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,480
moving the right does not give us a

375
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,360
better choice do we get it

376
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,120
so exactly so that would be air plus

377
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,360
equals one and then s ah minus equal one

378
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,639
okay and then we can answer okay what's

379
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,160
the tango next thing come on um

380
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,040
yeah yes

381
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,959
that's what i was about to say well okay

382
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,880
all right yeah because look y is

383
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,680
allowing we can prove we have two

384
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,839
pointers at one step

385
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,079
one pointer moves towards

386
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,880
the the other one you know you pick this

387
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,560
one or this one so when they meet how

388
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,040
many iterations

389
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,720
how many steps both yeah and exactly

390
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,519
yeah yeah it's like arrogant ryan you

391
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,000
you stand 10 meters apart

392
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,199
right and one

393
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,320
one step

394
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,839
yeah either eric or ryan what the words

395
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,440
one meter towards each other yeah

396
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,000
and then when you meet in the middle

397
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,079
somewhere in the middle the total step

398
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,360
would be 10 right

399
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,440
yeah you get it okay so that's the time

400
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,839
time capacity i'll win okay stay

401
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,040
complexity with one constant space okay

402
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,440
uh

403
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,440
and yeah that will be for today good job

404
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,800
you
