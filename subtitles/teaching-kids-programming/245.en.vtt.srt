don't next uh
actually i need to save this n equals

358
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
actually i need to save this n equals
 

359
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,670
actually i need to save this n equals
not the next

360
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
not the next
 

361
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,270
not the next
this value yeah and now it's this one

362
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
this value yeah and now it's this one
 

363
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,589
this value yeah and now it's this one
and then i can say no the value

364
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
and then i can say no the value
 

365
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,589
and then i can say no the value
equals what and the value right

366
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
equals what and the value right
 

367
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,629
equals what and the value right
yeah right so what does

368
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
yeah right so what does
 

369
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,550
yeah right so what does
mean this will become three okay

370
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
mean this will become three okay
 

371
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,589
mean this will become three okay
okay know the value equals end of value

372
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
okay know the value equals end of value
 

373
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,790
okay know the value equals end of value
and then i need to do what no dot

374
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
and then i need to do what no dot
 

375
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,150
and then i need to do what no dot
next no dot next equals to

376
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
next no dot next equals to
 

377
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,230
next no dot next equals to
what here yeah so what's that

378
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
what here yeah so what's that
 

379
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,029
what here yeah so what's that
what's this value what's this note no

380
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
what's this value what's this note no
 

381
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,749
what's this value what's this note no
don't x equals one

382
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
don't x equals one
 

383
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,710
don't x equals one
what's next now no no no this note is

384
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
what's next now no no no this note is
 

385
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,670
what's next now no no no this note is
what

386
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
what
 

387
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,270
what
this is n what's this b what's this

388
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
this is n what's this b what's this
 

389
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,189
this is n what's this b what's this
and the next okay right then i set it to

390
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
and the next okay right then i set it to
 

391
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,589
and the next okay right then i set it to
here

392
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
here
 

393
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,270
here
and then all the next thing is i wanted

394
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
and then all the next thing is i wanted
 

395
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,869
and then all the next thing is i wanted
to do this yeah

396
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
to do this yeah
 

397
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,070
to do this yeah
and d e l yeah did it

398
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
and d e l yeah did it
 

399
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,670
and d e l yeah did it
and that's it okay so what do we do

400
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
and that's it okay so what do we do
 

401
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,550
and that's it okay so what do we do
now what what do we do with n equals

402
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
now what what do we do with n equals
 

403
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,589
now what what do we do with n equals
node next

404
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
node next
 

405
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,110
node next
okay n is here right this node

406
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
okay n is here right this node
 

407
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,750
okay n is here right this node
the value i copy from the next node this

408
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
the value i copy from the next node this
 

409
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,150
the value i copy from the next node this
node

410
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
node
 

411
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,430
node
next next i say

412
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
next next i say
 

413
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,470
next next i say
i point it to n the next right another

414
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
i point it to n the next right another
 

415
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,750
i point it to n the next right another
complete this now

416
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
complete this now
 

417
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,870
complete this now
that's one way another way what's the

418
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
that's one way another way what's the
 

419
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,950
that's one way another way what's the
term complexity for this one

420
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:00,960
term complexity for this one
 

421
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,590
term complexity for this one
[Music]

422
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
[Music]
 

423
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,949
[Music]
come on what

424
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
come on what
 

425
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,070
come on what
why is the end why is that

426
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
why is the end why is that
 

427
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,790
why is the end why is that
all i do is just rearrange this what's a

428
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
all i do is just rearrange this what's a
 

429
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,550
all i do is just rearrange this what's a
one come on

430
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
one come on
 

431
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,630
one come on
yeah make sense that common sense okay

432
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
yeah make sense that common sense okay
 

433
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,670
yeah make sense that common sense okay
so another one

434
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
so another one
 

435
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,269
so another one
is what another way another way

436
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
is what another way another way
 

437
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,430
is what another way another way
let me think another one another way

438
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
let me think another one another way
 

439
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,389
let me think another one another way
okay so if

440
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
okay so if
 

441
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,310
okay so if
okay i tell you look one two

442
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
okay i tell you look one two
 

443
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,070
okay i tell you look one two
three four five

444
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
three four five
 

445
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,590
three four five
okay no i want you to do

446
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
okay no i want you to do
 

447
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
okay no i want you to do
this one so you become

448
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:37,690
this one so you become
 

449
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,030
this one so you become
[Music]

450
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
[Music]
 

451
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,790
[Music]
one you become one three four

452
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
one you become one three four
 

453
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,430
one you become one three four
five no

454
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440

 

455
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,870

wait can you delete can you even leave

456
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
wait can you delete can you even leave
 

457
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:59,350
wait can you delete can you even leave
this one at any moment any um

458
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360

 

459
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,550

wait so it's quite similar but

460
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
wait so it's quite similar but
 

461
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,829
wait so it's quite similar but
what we do is what look here look at

462
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
what we do is what look here look at
 

463
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,230
what we do is what look here look at
look at my hand

464
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240

 

465
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,509

what does that tell you two pointers

466
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
what does that tell you two pointers
 

467
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,870
what does that tell you two pointers
no no no look i i this bit is the pit i

468
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
no no no look i i this bit is the pit i
 

469
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,670
no no no look i i this bit is the pit i
want to keep how about i move it one

470
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
want to keep how about i move it one
 

471
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,710
want to keep how about i move it one
position to the left 61

472
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
position to the left 61
 

473
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,630
position to the left 61
so every time 2 equals 3 3 equals 4

474
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
so every time 2 equals 3 3 equals 4
 

475
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,829
so every time 2 equals 3 3 equals 4
4 equals 5 and i did the last one right

476
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
4 equals 5 and i did the last one right
 

477
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,710
4 equals 5 and i did the last one right
yeah every note is equal the value

478
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
yeah every note is equal the value
 

479
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,150
yeah every note is equal the value
equals its next node

480
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
equals its next node
 

481
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,590
equals its next node
right last one

482
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
right last one
 

483
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,069
right last one
now but the next last one and i will

484
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
now but the next last one and i will
 

485
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,990
now but the next last one and i will
just delete it but i have to keep a

486
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
just delete it but i have to keep a
 

487
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,590
just delete it but i have to keep a
previous one to the last one and the

488
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
previous one to the last one and the
 

489
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,509
previous one to the last one and the
previous tone next

490
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
previous tone next
 

491
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,949
previous tone next
equals num and i think it's equal

492
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
equals num and i think it's equal
 

493
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,230
equals num and i think it's equal
sorry that's the point five i would

494
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
sorry that's the point five i would
 

495
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,949
sorry that's the point five i would
defeat it

496

defeat it
 

497
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,310
defeat it
it doesn't matter i would remove it

498
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
it doesn't matter i would remove it
 

499
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,750
it doesn't matter i would remove it
right okay okay i write the code so you

500
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
right okay okay i write the code so you
 

501
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,430
right okay okay i write the code so you
probably know okay

502
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
probably know okay
 

503
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,350

node okay you will give it a no you are

506
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
node okay you will give it a no you are
 

507
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,110
node okay you will give it a no you are
not given anything else

508
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
not given anything else
 

509
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,670
not given anything else
so first of all you have a previous now

510
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
so first of all you have a previous now
 

511
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,030
so first of all you have a previous now
equals noun

512
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
equals noun
 

513
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,790
equals noun
the previous point the second to the

514
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
the previous point the second to the
 

515
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,069
the previous point the second to the
last right

516
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
last right
 

517
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,790
last right
so wire while no

518
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
so wire while no
 

519
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,310
so wire while no
dot next okay then i can say

520
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
dot next okay then i can say
 

521
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,750
dot next okay then i can say
no dot value equals one

522
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
no dot value equals one
 

523
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,470
no dot value equals one
no the value equals the next value no

524
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
no the value equals the next value no
 

525
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,389
no the value equals the next value no
don't next

526
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
don't next
 

527
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,550
don't next
value the value and then i have to save

528
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
value the value and then i have to save
 

529
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,750
value the value and then i have to save
the node previous

530
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
the node previous
 

531
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,870
the node previous
the node current no previous equals no

532
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
the node current no previous equals no
 

533
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,069
the node current no previous equals no
and then node equals

534
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
and then node equals
 

535
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,670
and then node equals
no the next right

536
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
no the next right
 

537
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,350
no the next right
right and then the previous one the

538
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
right and then the previous one the
 

539
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,030
right and then the previous one the
previous is now on the second knot

540
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
previous is now on the second knot
 

541
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,949
previous is now on the second knot
right because previous is second now

542
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
right because previous is second now
 

543
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,509
right because previous is second now
previous stop next

544
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
previous stop next
 

545
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,949
previous stop next
