1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,319
hello

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,880
hello mr mr ryan okay okay okay come on

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,880
come on okay

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,320
okay so today we still talk about uh

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,719
uh probability yeah probability of

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,800
rowing three dices and we want to you

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,800
know she's growing three dices here

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,920
growing three dioceses

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,840
but we want we want to calculate we want

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,000
to calculate

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,279
the probability

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,640
of increasing crisis okay increasing

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,520
numbers well what does it mean for

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,840
example one two three or two three four

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,719
yes strictly increasing yeah all right

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
yeah

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,760
uh four five six okay so this is the

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,760
kind of five six seven yeah no no

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,640
there's no seven right because the

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,960
thighs

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,920
yeah there could be one there's one up

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,920
to 12. why is one or twelve the dice is

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,920
only six six points yeah but they're

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,680
different times one of them goes from

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,079
there

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,239
okay okay original come color can you

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,520
sit tight please come on

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,840
okay so what's your thought

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,080
you um

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,880
first thing is that we want to so these

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,280
these three uh sequence yeah they are

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,360
unique right so like each number is each

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,200
size is unique all right yeah

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,320
okay so what's the probability of rowing

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
the

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,240
three

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,680
unique

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,000
numbers for the first one the

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,040
probability is we can pick any right

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,119
yeah

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
one what's the second if we pick the

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,439
first one what's this

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,119
probability of picking a second

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,520
number which is not the same as the

45
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,520
first one

46
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,920
what is it

47
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,320
so look what i realized i wrote a number

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,799
what's the problem

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,320
and what's the third one

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,600
which is not the same yeah for six okay

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,320
yeah so now after this i i will have we

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,520
will have we will have three unique

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,560
numbers yeah

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,719
numbers yeah this probability yeah yeah

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,660
yeah so three numbers how many

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,000
permutations it how many permutation

57
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,520
[Music]

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,959
three three numbers one two three how

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,080
many kind of permutations you remember

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:16,319
permutation six yeah which is what three

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,319
times two times one yeah three bacteria

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,879
so what we need to do is that

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
this probability just needs to divide it

64
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,280
by light right so

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,840
so let's calculate it to see

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,000
to see okay to see what's the value okay

67
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,959
let's just do this

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,239
uh

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,440
print

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,519
queen okay 0.1 put in this and this is

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,840
the probability of rolling three unique

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,239
dices yeah and then we need to divide it

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,800
by six yeah because this is the uh

74
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,120
permutation because look why we divided

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,800
by c pixel that the probability of

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,080
having three unique numbers there's only

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,640
one sequence which is squishy

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,879
yeah like two three one you can only

79
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,319
find one strictly increasing number

80
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,760
which is one two three all right because

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,840
they're different right

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,120
can you have

83
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,239
two no right

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,080
no right am right okay so let's do to

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,879
check this and see if

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,280
yeah

87
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:17,200
baby okay so see what's this number

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,360
okay so this is around

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,280
point two percentage okay okay nine

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
point two percent okay again

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,519
we put it the most boring way we can

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,080
iterate we can emulate all the possible

93
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,840
situations we just check if the first is

94
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,720
smaller than the second and then smaller

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
than the third one right

96
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,840
range one seven yeah can you tell me

97
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,799
what's the next four seconds in what

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,480
yeah

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,200
range one seven

100
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,519
four third one

101
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,799
again in range one seven yeah

102
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
yeah and then

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,720
look if

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,000
first smaller than

105
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,760
what

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,519
all right come on can you can you remind

107
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,280
me what to do next the first smaller

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,519
than second

109
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,680
smaller

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,159
yeah and then we want to call this

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,280
count plus equal one okay

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,840
cnt what's the total number

113
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,519
what's the total number of the situation

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,000
what's the total number if wrong three

115
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,680
status what's the total number of

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,960
possibilities

117
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,600
how many kind of choice is six three

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,160
three one is six two is one

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,680
five

120
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
no what i mean total number of

121
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,240
possibilities rolling one dice is six

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,639
six possibilities rolling another dice

123
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,759
to two two numbers

124
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,759
six times one

125
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,600
what huh okay two what do you mean two

126
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,680
what's the number of possibilities of

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,600
rolling one dice is six what's the

128
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,960
number probably 36. what's the number of

129
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,960
possibilities in three dices

130
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,040
yeah 260.

131
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,360
yeah okay i know we can print cnt

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,440
divided by total so this should give me

133
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,560
the roughly the same number yeah you see

134
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
what's the first

135
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,520
one

136
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,720
the last one is different yeah

137
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,400
okay

138
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,240
okay let's see okay look at look it's uh

139
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,680
different yeah okay so this number

140
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
rounded up to that you know the

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,600
mathematic calculation the floating

142
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,840
point calculation in computer has these

143
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
rounding errors all right because we're

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,320
using uh

145
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,400
using like four bytes or eight bytes

146
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,320
yeah to represent

147
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,919
a floating point number so for example

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,479
if i say print 1.2 minus

149
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,440
0.2 is it equal to

150
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,560
1.0 you will tell me first i believe

151
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,560
oh it will tell me true

152
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,520
yeah that's true

153
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,080
that's true okay let's try this one

154
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,720
okay so why is it two

155
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,400
13 point hours

156
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,919
14 point error

157
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,759
is 1.2 minus 1.0

158
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,440
0.2 1.2 minus 1.0 equal

159
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,440
yeah yeah

160
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,400
okay okay yeah yeah okay you're right

161
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,280
yeah okay

162
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,600
so

163
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,680
so sometimes it has these uh floating

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,039
point arrows yeah floating point errors

165
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,919
we have four there but this in

166
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,759
mathematics is is true why is that

167
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,720
because we can go

168
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,280
we can just check these uh you know

169
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,759
running flow python floating point error

170
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,360
okay price and floating around error

171
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,400
and then maybe we have a

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,319
better

173
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,080
uh

174
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,240
okay so one per better understanding

175
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,400
yeah you see

176
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,080
okay this is literally much more how the

177
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
underlying platform handling from for

178
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,919
okay this is normal case is an ultimate

179
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,880
performance international it's a problem

180
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,560
causes when the internet okay when uh

181
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,639
when the internal representation of

182
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,120
protein power which use a fixed number

183
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,280
of binary digital event to represent a

184
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,000
decimal number okay

185
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,000
yeah i see okay so

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,720
maybe we can search another one which is

187
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,160
called uh ieee floating point uh then

188
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,199
you will tell me how

189
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,160
i

190
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,280
i e i triple e okay so what does it look

191
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,479
like

192
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,639
so yes you see so this gives the

193
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,639
how do we represent uh 32 bit is 32 bit

194
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,639
is 4 bytes how do we represent a

195
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,039
floating point number so we are not

196
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,639
representing a number like minus

197
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:29,199
248.75 this is a string and we represent

198
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,039
it something like minus something to the

199
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,240
power of something yeah do you

200
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,840
understand yeah

201
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,639
okay so so it has these four uh

202
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,919
arrows yeah errors look the first bit is

203
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,960
sign positive or negative exponential

204
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,960
meant inside

205
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,599
okay

206
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,560
okay so that explained that that is

207
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:55,680
something that we might come into

208
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,759
you know we might discuss a bit in more

209
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,440
details later okay but you for now you

210
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,440
just have to know that

211
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,759
the the number of the ways that computer

212
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,759
handles the floating point numbers is it

213
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,680
has this position errors right because

214
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,759
they only have these four bytes or eight

215
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,199
bytes four bytes for a single closing

216
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,400
number eight bytes for double numbers to

217
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,080
to store the the numbers yeah yeah do

218
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,000
you get it because look for for the

219
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,479
integer for the integer same as the

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
integer like integer has

221
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,800
one by f

222
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,599
one bar is eight b it's if it's if it's

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,360
uh one bike it's 255

224
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,440
right zero to two hundred fifty so it's

225
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,599
one one one one this is 15 right all

226
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,320
right and then one one one one okay

227
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,719
there are eight ones one a ones the so

228
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,040
this is what this is what this is 255

229
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,600
okay if i print it

230
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,120
if i print it it would be 255 this is

231
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,440
actually one bite

232
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,720
one bite okay yeah one bite has eight

233
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,279
bits right it's big each bit is zero and

234
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,200
one there are two yeah do you understand

235
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,440
okay so if it's one bit what's the how

236
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
many numbers we can store if it's one

237
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
bit

238
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,120
two right zero and one how about two

239
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,800
bits

240
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,800
what's the maximum number we can stop

241
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,120
two bits you know one zero one

242
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,360
zero zero zero one one zero one one how

243
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,519
many four yeah yeah

244
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,399
how many how about three bits

245
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,279
you know one zero zero zero zero zero

246
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,760
one zero one zero two do you get it

247
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,440
so it's can't remember the pattern

248
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,920
you don't need to remember a pattern the

249
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,399
thing is that each one look each one

250
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,920
each one has two possibilities

251
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,560
so it is a

252
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,560
two times two times two so right so how

253
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,160
many eight common

254
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,000
ones are there they are eight so it's

255
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,519
two to the power of eight

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,760
right so that's 250 do you get it yeah

257
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,519
so it's like that we have eight buckets

258
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,839
each one has

259
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,720
has has two choice

260
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,760
right

261
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,600
all right

262
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,200
it's the same it's quite similar than

263
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,000
rolling a dices

264
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,399
right the first the first size you have

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,839
six sixth possibility right

266
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,240
the second one you have another six

267
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,399
possibility the third one has another

268
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,279
six probability so how many total number

269
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,839
we can represent using the

270
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,839
a dice

271
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,480
six times six seven six yeah yeah that's

272
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,640
the that's the multiplication and it's

273
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,360
the same thing here yeah okay

274
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,839
okay so look at these we are iterating

275
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,720
the dice yeah we just simulating the

276
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,720
situation so then we we try to roll the

277
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,399
first dice and we roll the second dice

278
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,079
and then we roll the third eyes and we

279
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,360
check if the first day is smaller than

280
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,440
the second dice is smaller than the

281
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,120
third day then we increment this counter

282
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,079
and we divided by the total number of

283
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,640
occurrence which is 216 and that gives

284
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,519
us the possibility yeah okay so which is

285
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,040
around 9.2 percentage am right what's

286
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,519
the time complexity if you look in this

287
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,519
for loop

288
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,399
what's the tank of

289
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,079
velocity

290
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,399
what's the time commercially

291
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,320
uh what oh what whether because the

292
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,079
input are fixed yeah input are fixed

293
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,560
there's no n here right it's all one

294
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:14,240
constant the total number of iterations

295
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,680
we are going to simulate is 216 am i

296
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,160
yeah

297
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,330
yeah okay that's it for today come on

298
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,450
bye bye
