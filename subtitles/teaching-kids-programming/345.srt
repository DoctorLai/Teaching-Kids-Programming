1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
go

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,000
hello mr are you all right

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,839
mr ryan are you right yeah okay so we

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,519
have talked about uh

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,599
we talked about the link list before how

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,719
about let's say we have a link list one

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,320
three

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,560
five

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,520
seven okay and that's it

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,720
and if the first note has the index like

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,960
an array

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,279
okay and then this is index one and

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,160
that's two index three

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,000
given

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,519
how about let's say we want to insert a

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,880
new node

17
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,600
nine

18
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,079
just right before the index two so index

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,760
two is this node number five we want to

20
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,520
insert the new node

21
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,000
between the number five between uh

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,760
before the number five okay so it will

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,920
become like this yeah so one three

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,200
nine this is the new note yeah this is a

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,000
new note

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,199
uh

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,879
five

28
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,879
seven okay

29
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,920
yeah

30
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,399
makes sense

31
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
so this this note okay can i have your

32
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,160
attention please this now is the

33
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,000
inserted neuron

34
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,519
and how about look i have a noun here

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,080
and i

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,159
can you draw a link list with the number

37
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,240
two insert and the zero index zero

38
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,799
before index zero yeah perfect okay so

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,720
because look at this because this is a

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,280
very special case why is that because we

41
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,960
are returning the note the inserted note

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,080
as a new head

43
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,000
make sense

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,920
this head is not changing but this this

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,640
has been changing yeah we are inserting

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,079
a new note which becomes the head of the

47
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
linkage right

48
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,759
he is he's the leader yeah yeah okay so

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,400
look if i want to have a put look this

50
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,399
isn't english uh this is a node yeah one

51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,640
points to two if i want to put a new

52
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,880
node three

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,159
right between these ones two

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
what do you think

55
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,000
what's the steps

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
if there are three two nodes one point

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,520
two two and i want to be inside that no

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,360
three okay

59
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,719
so you pretend to present this guy is

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,640
great

61
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,640
yeah

62
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,360
and just you ain't

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,679
too bad okay that's one way that's one

64
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,920
way yeah but you don't know what

65
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,760
happened next right you have to yeah

66
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,680
that's one way but how about they're

67
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:22,160
fine i know how about it okay so you

68
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,400
so you just cut this yeah yeah cut it um

69
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,879
yeah but how how to cut it

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,879
oh yes

71
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,080
i'm just splitting it with no arrow yeah

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,239
yeah that's first step yeah and then you

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,760
put the three in the middle and then you

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,680
want it back okay you don't need to put

75
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,000
a three meter you just you you just do

76
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,160
this one and points to three and then

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,599
three points to two

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,480
make sense

79
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,800
yeah okay so that's one step so but

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,280
overall we need to do what

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
we need to do what overall

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
sorry

83
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,480
all right

84
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,680
i can twist my head

85
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,760
okay so

86
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,400
so because we are changing the head

87
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,280
right so we are not sure

88
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,360
yeah we are not sure if the new hat new

89
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,360
new value we inserted is going to be the

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,319
head come on listen to me

91
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,319
yeah what did you say he said they gave

92
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,319
me a new head yeah yeah okay so

93
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,799
okay so look

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,680
for the link please if we want to do it

95
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,040
we can have a dummy head dummy here what

96
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,040
does it mean so means

97
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,720
that which which is

98
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,560
we are not going to use it

99
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,879
yeah it's just a temporary note we are

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,720
creating everybody call it dummy okay

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,480
okay oh extra okay and then we pointed

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,640
to the neck to the head this is the head

103
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,879
yeah this is the head

104
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,879
okay

105
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,729
[Music]

106
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,759
but we also need to remember

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,720
remember the previous note which is this

108
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,800
one right this is the previous now right

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,840
so what should i do now i have a this

110
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,720
value value i i have this value

111
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,400
so how look this is the exactly the

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,240
situation once we insert the value

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,440
between these three the previous and

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
ahead

115
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,680
right

116
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,280
so

117
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,440
the first step is i previously had

118
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,199
previous.next equals the i need to save

119
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,280
this value first okay i need to save

120
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,160
this value

121
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,520
yeah

122
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,240
so previous previous value previous to

123
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,360
next equals value and the variable down

124
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,360
next

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,400
will be equals the head right yeah

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,360
makes sense

127
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,320
look so if so because look these

128
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,960
previous the next is this at this one

129
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,440
so i reassign to value so i basically

130
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,479
it's the same as cutting cutting these

131
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,880
and reassigning to value and values next

132
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,840
so in this way we are actually putting a

133
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:31,199
new value a note between these two now

134
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,199
make sense yeah make sense yes you sure

135
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,240
is here

136
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,320
okay so let's do it

137
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,320
let's do it

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,560
any questions

139
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,080
okay

140
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,400
defy

141
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,639
nope define uh

142
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,960
let's say insert

143
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,199
and we have a head

144
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,600
and we have a value

145
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,639
and a position no no no no yeah

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,680
so look

147
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,080
look if not if we are not we are not

148
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,280
giving anything empty we just return

149
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,880
this area return a new node no

150
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,440
no

151
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,280
no value right we don't care right we

152
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,639
don't care about the position because if

153
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,880
the if the original linked list is empty

154
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,120
we just return it right and then as i

155
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,000
said we have a dummy

156
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,560
equals note

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,520
and minus one minus one minus two it

158
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,520
doesn't matter yeah or zero

159
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,000
the second value will be the next yeah

160
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,800
so you actually you can say fatah me

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,960
equals note and feta me the next equals

162
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,520
head okay the second parameter is the

163
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,919
the next one okay so let's say we have

164
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,280
this note can english no

165
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,800
and then define

166
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,520
in it

167
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,520
itself

168
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,479
yeah yeah yeah can you can you listen to

169
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,479
me very oh and then

170
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,840
but do you understand

171
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,520
do you understand huh

172
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,919
yeah i'm going to close these okay i'm

173
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,199
not looking right you're not looking but

174
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,199
you're you're shouting

175
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,400
okay

176
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,960
so this is the

177
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,639
this is the definition of a linked list

178
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,919
now come on look at me long look at this

179
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,440
thing

180
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,319
yeah wow

181
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,039
any question for this one

182
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,440
okay so look the the first parameter is

183
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,440
the value the second parameter is the

184
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,000
pointer to the next number okay

185
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,000
so this one is the next node

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,919
and now

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,599
now we just need to find out the place

188
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,080
here so let's say previous equals

189
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,479
also equals damian by dummy

190
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,479
dummy

191
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,120
and now we can say 4

192
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,360
in range we want to find out where it is

193
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,360
yeah

194
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,639
so head

195
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,440
equals head

196
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,440
dot

197
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,240
next

198
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,399
high equal equal next and

199
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,479
and then we previous equals heavy and we

200
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,919
need to store the previous one

201
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,800
remember

202
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,959
yeah

203
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,000
and now we have to put we can we can

204
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,680
insert it here so we can say

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,839
previous

206
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,080
previous dot next equals

207
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,920
note now the value yeah we are inserting

208
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,880
this new node

209
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,720
right

210
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,120
yeah look this is previous

211
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,120
this is a head

212
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,959
there's a link and then we are inserting

213
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
as the value here

214
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,560
right

215
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,279
yeah so look three

216
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,440
previous the next equals no don't next

217
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,560
so that that will become here all right

218
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,560
so what's what's your idea

219
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,200
okay so i need to save this the previous

220
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,839
uh

221
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,959
same same this yeah so previous

222
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,920
previous dot next dot next

223
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,480
equal as head next one yeah

224
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,959
yeah previous so next is this one

225
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,200
and dot next is head

226
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,880
next okay and then we turn off return

227
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,480
what can you tell me

228
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,399
fat dummy

229
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,800
phenomenal retaining freedom or

230
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,800
photometer next

231
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,800
yeah

232
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,519
so

233
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,920
so totally okay so we are finding that

234
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,160
the places which is we are finding a

235
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,160
place which is this bit okay this bit

236
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,880
we repeat position time we actually we

237
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,120
walk position times and then with every

238
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,200
time before we walk to the next we

239
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,880
remember its previous equals hat right

240
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,200
so i when this ends when this loop ends

241
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,040
over here the previous is one note

242
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,160
before the head right

243
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,720
yeah so previously it was like that yeah

244
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,320
yeah look we want to insert

245
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,640
oh no

246
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,519
yeah the previous look so they're not

247
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,959
previous to next equals node value which

248
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,839
is this one

249
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,920
all right

250
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,160
and then previous the next the next

251
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,800
equals the head all right

252
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,800
all right so return certainly the next

253
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,800
right

254
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,959
constant time space or linear space are

255
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,959
we using any

256
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,880
what space are we using at this time

257
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:26,320
we're using a phantom let's see

258
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:30,320
a one a one yeah because that is

259
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,320
supposed to be oh fat dummy

260
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,079
okay

261
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,480
okay that's it for today good job let's

262
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,480
see bye bye
