is six yeah okay how about

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
is six yeah okay how about
 

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,870
is six yeah okay how about
five factorial what five

12
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:29,880

how many zeros how many zeros
 

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,110
how many zeros how many zeros
one one zero okay so the question today

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
one one zero okay so the question today
 

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,790
one one zero okay so the question today
is very simple

20
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
is very simple
 

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,389
is very simple
n factorial called how many zeros at the

22
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
n factorial called how many zeros at the
 

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,150
n factorial called how many zeros at the
end

24
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
end
 

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,549
end
yeah think about it look five factorial

26
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:58,559
yeah think about it look five factorial
 

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,670
yeah think about it look five factorial
is 120

28
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
is 120
 

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,590
is 120
so one zero it should be 21.

30
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
so one zero it should be 21.
 

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,210
so one zero it should be 21.
and then maybe

32
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:05,220
and then maybe
 

33
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,710
and then maybe

six bacteria equals 720
 

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,270
six bacteria equals 720
is still one zero so do you do you see

38
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
is still one zero so do you do you see
 

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,910

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
quicker
 

47
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,469

without just getting to count of course

48
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
without just getting to count of course
 

49
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,990
without just getting to count of course
all you just

50
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000

 

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,830

first of all the solution would be you

52
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
first of all the solution would be you
 

53
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,910
first of all the solution would be you
can't you calculate this actual value

54
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
can't you calculate this actual value
 

55
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,469
can't you calculate this actual value
yeah

yeah
 

57
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,950
yeah
and then count how many of these yeah

58
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
and then count how many of these yeah
 

59
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,030
and then count how many of these yeah
yeah it's really slow yes you're right

60
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
yeah it's really slow yes you're right
 

61
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,389
yeah it's really slow yes you're right
let's see we're now

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,069
let's see we're now
doing it i'll count in 24 times five

00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
doing it i'll count in 24 times five
 

65
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,910
doing it i'll count in 24 times five
okay count zero let's add bacteria okay

66
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
okay count zero let's add bacteria okay
 

67
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,749
okay count zero let's add bacteria okay
look answer let's say bacteria okay f

68
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
look answer let's say bacteria okay f

75
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,910
two to the n plus one right column yeah
and f1 f1 times

76
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
and f1 f1 times
 

77
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,190
and f1 f1 times
equals what f times equal

78
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
equals what f times equal
 

79
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,869
equals what f times equal
n every time yes you're right

80
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
n every time yes you're right
 

81
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,229
n every time yes you're right
now with f is the n factorial now

82
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
now with f is the n factorial now
 

83
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,710
now with f is the n factorial now
f is n factorial now we want to count

84
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
f is n factorial now we want to count
 

85
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,550
f is n factorial now we want to count
how many zero right

86
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
how many zero right
 

87
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,150
how many zero right
yeah we want to count how many zero

88
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
yeah we want to count how many zero
 

89
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,830
yeah we want to count how many zero
right

90
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
right
 

91
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,630
right
equals one yes right we want to call how

92
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
equals one yes right we want to call how
 

93
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,350
equals one yes right we want to call how
many zero

94
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
many zero
 

95
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,190
many zero
right right so now look we can have

96
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
right right so now look we can have
 

97
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,309
right right so now look we can have
these

98
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
these
 

99
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,750
these
zeros let's zeros equals zero first

100
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
zeros let's zeros equals zero first
 

101
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,949
zeros let's zeros equals zero first
yeah first then look why

102
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959

 

103
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:55,509

why what what are you doing

104
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519

 

105
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,949

now what f modulus 10 is

106
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
now what f modulus 10 is
 

107
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,790
now what f modulus 10 is
0 is still 0 then f divided

108
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
0 is still 0 then f divided
 

109
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,470
0 is still 0 then f divided
equals 10 remove one zero and zeros

110
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
equals 10 remove one zero and zeros
 

111
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,550
equals 10 remove one zero and zeros
plus equals one right and then return

112
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
plus equals one right and then return
 

113
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,830
plus equals one right and then return
zero am right

114
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
zero am right
 

115
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,990
zero am right
yeah is it is it is it true

116
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
yeah is it is it is it true
 

117
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,229
yeah is it is it is it true
what's the time complexity what's the

118
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
what's the time complexity what's the
 

119
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,200
what's the time complexity what's the

look do you understand this look if this

124
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
look do you understand this look if this
 

125
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,270
look do you understand this look if this
120f is 120 yeah

126
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
120f is 120 yeah
 

127
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,309
120f is 120 yeah
why 180 divided by 10

128
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
why 180 divided by 10
 

129
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,670
why 180 divided by 10
remain is what zero right yeah

130
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
remain is what zero right yeah
 

131
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,190
remain is what zero right yeah
and then i i f f is least then

132
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
and then i i f f is least then
 

133
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,270
and then i i f f is least then
divided by is 10 it will become l

134
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
divided by is 10 it will become l
 

135
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,750
divided by is 10 it will become l
becomes 12. i take away zero

136
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
becomes 12. i take away zero
 

137
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,390
becomes 12. i take away zero
and i put one increment one zero right

138
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
and i put one increment one zero right
 

139
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,309
and i put one increment one zero right
so it's one return right to get it

140
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
so it's one return right to get it
 

141
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,270
so it's one return right to get it
yeah yeah what's the term complexity

142
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280

 

143
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,509

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,630
one no a1 not a1 and
another you say

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,950
squares
i think think about that way yes if you

172
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
i think think about that way yes if you
 

173
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,870
i think think about that way yes if you
if each eye had each each multiplication

174
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
if each eye had each each multiplication
 

175
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,230
if each eye had each each multiplication
as one more zero

176
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
as one more zero
 

177
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,749
as one more zero
right yeah so how many years

178
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
right yeah so how many years
 

179
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,469
right yeah so how many years
at most

180
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479

 

181
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,749

yeah how many zeros at most

182
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
yeah how many zeros at most
 

183
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,990
yeah how many zeros at most
yeah yeah one i think

184
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
yeah yeah one i think
 

185
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,270
yeah yeah one i think
one yeah one

186
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,280
one yeah one
 

187
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,749
one yeah one
[Music]

188
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759

 

189
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,870

ten thousand ten thousand

190
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
ten thousand ten thousand
 

191
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,629
ten thousand ten thousand
ten thousand no just kidding

192
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
ten thousand no just kidding
 

193
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,070
ten thousand no just kidding
three what why we want one thing

194
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
three what why we want one thing
 

195
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,110
three what why we want one thing
okay okay anyway this one is very very

196
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
okay okay anyway this one is very very
 

197
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,390
okay okay anyway this one is very very
slow am i right this is very slow yeah

198
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
slow am i right this is very slow yeah
 

199
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:28,840
slow am i right this is very slow yeah
is it very slow so can we do better

200
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:28,850

 

201
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,110

[Music]

202
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
[Music]
 

203
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,670
[Music]
this the com complexity for this one is

204
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
this the com complexity for this one is
 

205
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,790
this the com complexity for this one is
all n square right it's a bit

206
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
all n square right it's a bit
 

207
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,629
all n square right it's a bit
complicated we

208
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
complicated we
 

209
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,909
complicated we
leave it later okay uh so can we do

210
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
leave it later okay uh so can we do
 

211
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,110
leave it later okay uh so can we do
better

212
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
better
 

213
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,070
better
how do you know why we get the zero at

214
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
how do you know why we get the zero at
 

215
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,629
how do you know why we get the zero at
the end

216
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
the end
 

217
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,909
the end
what what times what is equal to zero

218
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
what what times what is equal to zero
 

219
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,670
what what times what is equal to zero
can you think about it zero normally

220
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
can you think about it zero normally
 

221
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,230
can you think about it zero normally
things

222
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
things
 

223
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,629
things
no no but effectively look n factorial

224
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
no no but effectively look n factorial
 

225
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,070
no no but effectively look n factorial
there's no zero in there

226
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
there's no zero in there
 

227
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,790
there's no zero in there
right so anything as a path from zero

228
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
right so anything as a path from zero
 

229
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,430
right so anything as a path from zero
so how do we get 120 what comes what

230
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
so how do we get 120 what comes what
 

231
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,629
so how do we get 120 what comes what
times

232
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
times
 

233
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,350
times
one twenty two times three times four

234
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
one twenty two times three times four
 

235
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,909
one twenty two times three times four
times five

236
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
times five
 

237
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,870
times five
and four times five which which which

238
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
and four times five which which which
 

239
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,670
and four times five which which which
numbers

240
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
numbers
 

241
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,270
numbers
make ten make a zero at the end

242
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
make ten make a zero at the end
 

243
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,670
make ten make a zero at the end
two times five yeah we're done two times

244
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
two times five yeah we're done two times
 

245
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,350
two times five yeah we're done two times
right yeah

246
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
right yeah
 

247
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,469
right yeah
okay so now these actually 4 is also 2

248
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
okay so now these actually 4 is also 2
 

249
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,749
okay so now these actually 4 is also 2
times 2 right

250
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
times 2 right
 

251
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,029
times 2 right
yes the factor we call talk about factor

252
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
yes the factor we call talk about factor
 

253
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,270
yes the factor we call talk about factor
so actually we want to count the vector

254
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
so actually we want to count the vector
 

255
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,710
so actually we want to count the vector
2 and 5.

256
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
2 and 5.
 

257
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,390
2 and 5.
yeah so to these 2 could go with

258
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
yeah so to these 2 could go with
 

259
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,430
yeah so to these 2 could go with
two times table yeah yeah at least it

260
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
two times table yeah yeah at least it
 

261
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,749
two times table yeah yeah at least it
would be

262
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
would be
 

263
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,029
would be
five times table right yes

264
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039

 

265
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,150

yes so look any of these

266
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
yes so look any of these
 

267
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,150
yes so look any of these
comes together you reside a zero at the

268
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
comes together you reside a zero at the
 

269
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,670
comes together you reside a zero at the
end right

270
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
end right
 

271
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,670
end right
this is two times table five factor

272
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
this is two times table five factor
 

273
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,150
this is two times table five factor
right yeah so we just want to count how

274
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
right yeah so we just want to count how
 

275
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,749
right yeah so we just want to count how
many

276
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
many
 

277
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,469
many
factors of two and how many factors of

278
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
factors of two and how many factors of
 

279
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,510
factors of two and how many factors of
five yeah

280
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
five yeah
 

281
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,570
five yeah
and the minimum will be

282
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:00,580
and the minimum will be
 

283
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,550
and the minimum will be
[Music]

284
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560

 

285
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,950

so do you think we need to count both or

286
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
so do you think we need to count both or
 

287
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,870
so do you think we need to count both or
we can just count one of it which one is

288
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
we can just count one of it which one is
 

289
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,469
we can just count one of it which one is
definitely more

290
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479

 

291
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,870

which one yeah which one is definitely

292
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
which one yeah which one is definitely
 

293
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,550
which one yeah which one is definitely
more the

294
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
more the
 

295
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,870
more the
factors number of two or number five

296
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
factors number of two or number five
 

297
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,589
factors number of two or number five
which one

298
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
which one
 

299
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,950
which one
has more is more two

300
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
has more is more two
 

301
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,870
has more is more two
yes of course look yeah each even number

302
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
yes of course look yeah each even number
 

303
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,150
yes of course look yeah each even number
has two right but this is every five has

304
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
has two right but this is every five has
 

305
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,749
has two right but this is every five has
one right this is

306
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
one right this is
 

307
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,670
one right this is
this is and this has two right five

308
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
this is and this has two right five
 

309
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,950
this is and this has two right five
times five yes

310
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
times five yes
 

311
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,990
times five yes
yes yes so we just need to count how

312
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
yes yes so we just need to count how
 

313
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,110
yes yes so we just need to count how
many fives

314
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
many fives
 

315
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,670
many fives
right yeah how many fives we don't need

316
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
right yeah how many fives we don't need
 

317
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,309
right yeah how many fives we don't need
to

318
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
to
 

319
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,749
to
tell a calculate h of factorial

320
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
tell a calculate h of factorial
 

321
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,390
tell a calculate h of factorial
we just need to count how many fives in

322
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
we just need to count how many fives in
 

323
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,950
we just need to count how many fives in
each number fact factorial right

324
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
each number fact factorial right
 

325
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,270
each number fact factorial right
so how we can do this

326
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280

 

327
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,629

we can do this zero

328
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
we can do this zero
 

329
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,909
we can do this zero
because first of all is zero okay now

330
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919
because first of all is zero okay now
 

331
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,950
because first of all is zero okay now
four i in when we start from five right

332
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
four i in when we start from five right
 

333
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,230
four i in when we start from five right
because because from one to one times

334
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
because because from one to one times
 

335
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,390
because because from one to one times
two times three times four

336
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
two times three times four
 

337
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,909
two times three times four
seven produce zero right yes

338
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
seven produce zero right yes
 

339
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,710
seven produce zero right yes
so five and then this will be m plus one

340
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
so five and then this will be m plus one
 

341
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,510
so five and then this will be m plus one
and

342
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
and
 

343
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,550
and
every five every step five

344
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
every five every step five
 

345
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,070
every five every step five
right and now we can say current equals

346
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
right and now we can say current equals
 

347
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,630
right and now we can say current equals
i y current

348
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640

 

349
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,949

so now we need to count how many fives

350
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
so now we need to count how many fives
 

351
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:35,909
so now we need to count how many fives
in this number

352
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
in this number
 

353
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,389
in this number
well column is five sorry uh

354
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
well column is five sorry uh
 

355
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,990
well column is five sorry uh
what do you mean counterfeit huh what do

356
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
what do you mean counterfeit huh what do
 

357
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,589
what do you mean counterfeit huh what do
you mean

358
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
you mean
 

359
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,990
you mean
we want to count how many five so how do

360
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
we want to count how many five so how do
 

361
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,350
we want to count how many five so how do
we do this

362
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
we do this
 

363
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,150
we do this
how many five no zero yeah we have how

364
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
how many five no zero yeah we have how
 

365
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,030
how many five no zero yeah we have how
many five

366
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
many five
 

367
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,230
many five
so if if current five current

368
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
so if if current five current
 

369
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,190
so if if current five current
divided by five is zero can be divided

370
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
divided by five is zero can be divided
 

371
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,389
divided by five is zero can be divided
by five

372
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
by five
 

373
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,150
by five
then we added this zero plus equals one

374
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
then we added this zero plus equals one
 

375
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,590
then we added this zero plus equals one
and then current divided by five

376
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
and then current divided by five
 

377
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,509
and then current divided by five
right and then return zero y divided by

378
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
right and then return zero y divided by
 

379
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,030
right and then return zero y divided by
equal five we

380
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040

 

381
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,790

need this current this thing

382
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
need this current this thing
 

383
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,470
need this current this thing
is the same as current equals current

384
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
is the same as current equals current
 

385
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,829
is the same as current equals current
divided by phi integer to to divide

386
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
divided by phi integer to to divide
 

387
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,910
divided by phi integer to to divide
is means i want the integer only the

388
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
is means i want the integer only the
 

389
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,509
is means i want the integer only the
integer yes

390
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
integer yes
 

391
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,150
integer yes
all right what's the time complexity

392
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160

 

393
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,740

what's this term complexity

394
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:34,750
what's this term complexity
 

395
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,310
what's this term complexity
[Music]

396
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320

 

397
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,310

[Applause]

398
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
[Applause]
 

399
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,070
[Applause]
yeah this is n this looks like

400
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
yeah this is n this looks like
 

401
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,310
yeah this is n this looks like
looks like possibly i mean because

402
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
looks like possibly i mean because
 

403
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,590
looks like possibly i mean because
everything divided by five so i'll log n

404
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
everything divided by five so i'll log n
 

405
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,630
everything divided by five so i'll log n
but actually this is quite

406
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
but actually this is quite
 

407
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,829
but actually this is quite
quite small because look it could be

408
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
quite small because look it could be
 

409
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,269
quite small because look it could be
any number divided by 5 will be 5

410
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
any number divided by 5 will be 5
 

411
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,190
any number divided by 5 will be 5
25 125

412
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
25 125
 

413
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,190
25 125
600 what 25 yes

414
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
600 what 25 yes
 

415
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,790
600 what 25 yes
i need at least this will be

416
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
i need at least this will be
 

417
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,870
i need at least this will be
a very very very uh small okay so

418
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
a very very very uh small okay so
 

419
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,030
a very very very uh small okay so
actually you can say oh and lock

420
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
actually you can say oh and lock
 

421
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,150
actually you can say oh and lock
five base n yeah yeah yes

422
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
five base n yeah yeah yes
 

423
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,110
five base n yeah yeah yes
yeah yeah okay so this is the same same

424
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
yeah yeah okay so this is the same same
 

425
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,550
yeah yeah okay so this is the same same
as uh i can

426
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
as uh i can
 

427
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,870
as uh i can
i can do it the other way so current i

428
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
i can do it the other way so current i
 

429
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,870
i can do it the other way so current i
can say

430
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
can say
 

431
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,590
can say
power of 5 power 5 equals what 5

432
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
power of 5 power 5 equals what 5
 

433
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,630
power of 5 power 5 equals what 5
right and then i can say this

434
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
right and then i can say this
 

435
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,990
right and then i can say this
is the same current multiply

436
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
is the same current multiply
 

437
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,910
is the same current multiply
power 5 and a nice and powerful

438
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
power 5 and a nice and powerful
 

439
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,389
power 5 and a nice and powerful
e times equals five right this is the

440
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
e times equals five right this is the
 

441
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,110
e times equals five right this is the
same thing yeah

442
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
same thing yeah
 

443
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,269
same thing yeah
is it the same thing is it the same

444
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
is it the same thing is it the same
 

445
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,350
is it the same thing is it the same
thing

446
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
thing
 

447
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,949
thing
is that something yes it's the same

448
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
is that something yes it's the same
 

449
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,870
is that something yes it's the same
thing here yeah

450
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
thing here yeah
 

451
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,310
thing here yeah
so look first of all is five i divided

452
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
so look first of all is five i divided
 

453
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,710
so look first of all is five i divided
five

454
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
five
 

455
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,110
five
and then five times five twenty five i

456
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
and then five times five twenty five i
 

457
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,310
and then five times five twenty five i
checked how many fives

458
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
checked how many fives
 

459
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,350
checked how many fives
how many fives yeah like because 25 has

460
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
how many fives yeah like because 25 has
 

461
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,509
how many fives yeah like because 25 has
two five and the next one is

462
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
two five and the next one is
 

463
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,509
two five and the next one is
125 has three fives yes yeah got it

464
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
125 has three fives yes yeah got it
 

465
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,509
125 has three fives yes yeah got it
got it yes

466
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519

 

467
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,870

so can we do even better yeah

468
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
so can we do even better yeah
 

469
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,870
so can we do even better yeah
can we do it even better

470
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880

 

471
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,030

so we just want to count how many fives

472
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
so we just want to count how many fives
 

473
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,550
so we just want to count how many fives
right yes

474
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
right yes
 

475
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,110
right yes
we just want how many five this has one

476
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
we just want how many five this has one
 

477
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,750
we just want how many five this has one
five

478
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
five
 

479
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,350
five
so let's say let's say

480
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
so let's say let's say
 

481
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,949
so let's say let's say
okay look 30

482
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
okay look 30
 

483
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,470
okay look 30
factorial it equals 1 times 2 times 3

484
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
factorial it equals 1 times 2 times 3
 

485
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,870
factorial it equals 1 times 2 times 3
times 4 times 5

486
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
times 4 times 5
 

487
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,550
times 4 times 5
yeah and then

488
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
yeah and then
 

489
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,990
yeah and then
10

490
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000

 

491
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,030

20 15

492
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,040
20 15
 

493
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,110
20 15
20 25 30.

494
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120

 

495
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,870

how many fives how many fives

496
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
how many fives how many fives
 

497
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,110
how many fives how many fives
how many five

498
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
how many five
 

499
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,269
how many five
probably six five

500
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
probably six five
 

501
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,590
probably six five
not exactly look this is six five yes

502
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
not exactly look this is six five yes
 

503
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,629
not exactly look this is six five yes
six five

504
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
six five
 

505
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,990
six five
you need to 30 divided by five that's

506
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
you need to 30 divided by five that's
 

507
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,590
you need to 30 divided by five that's
six five at least look

508
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
six five at least look
 

509
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,870
six five at least look
this is this is another this is another

510
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
this is this is another this is another
 

511
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,470
this is this is another this is another
one

512
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
one
 

513
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,670
one
five times five okay so that

514
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
five times five okay so that
 

515
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,550
five times five okay so that
means i need to plus 30 divided by 25

516
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
means i need to plus 30 divided by 25
 

517
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,750
means i need to plus 30 divided by 25
this is one right

518
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
this is one right
 

519
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,870
this is one right
only integer one so it'd be six plus one

520
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
only integer one so it'd be six plus one
 

521
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,150
only integer one so it'd be six plus one
equals seven yeah yeah yeah yeah

522
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
equals seven yeah yeah yeah yeah
 

523
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,350
equals seven yeah yeah yeah yeah
so again if i go to 125 go to

524
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
so again if i go to 125 go to
 

525
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,829
so again if i go to 125 go to
250 what and here would be

526
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839

 

527
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,509

250

528
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519

 

529
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,670

yeah so 5 25 so basically

530
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
yeah so 5 25 so basically
 

531
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,150
yeah so 5 25 so basically
the number of 5 is what n divided by 5

532
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
the number of 5 is what n divided by 5
 

533
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,509
the number of 5 is what n divided by 5
plus 10 divided by 25 plus n divided by

534
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
plus 10 divided by 25 plus n divided by
 

535
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,829
plus 10 divided by 25 plus n divided by
125 plus n divided by

536
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:10,839
125 plus n divided by
 

537
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:13,829
125 plus n divided by
625 plus yeah

538
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
625 plus yeah
 

539
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,949
625 plus yeah
do you get it am i right yeah

540
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
do you get it am i right yeah
 

541
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,790
do you get it am i right yeah
yeah so how can we write this code

542
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800

 

543
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,150

how can we write this code and place the

544
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
how can we write this code and place the
 

545
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,190
how can we write this code and place the
answer my answer is yellow

546
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
answer my answer is yellow
 

547
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,870
answer my answer is yellow
yes and then why at the end

548
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880

 

549
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,829

okay so think about it what how do we

550
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
okay so think about it what how do we
 

551
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,189
okay so think about it what how do we
how do we calculate this

552
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
how do we calculate this
 

553
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,949
how do we calculate this
divided by n divided by and divide by

554
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
divided by n divided by and divide by
 

555
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,150
divided by n divided by and divide by
five sorry and divide by

556
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
five sorry and divide by
 

557
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,430
five sorry and divide by
five yeah and divided by five yes now

558
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
five yeah and divided by five yes now
 

559
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,470
five yeah and divided by five yes now
when n is bigger than zero

560
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
when n is bigger than zero
 

561
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,509
when n is bigger than zero
then

562
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519

 

563
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,069

and divided by five and divided by

564
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
and divided by five and divided by
 

565
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,110
and divided by five and divided by
five that's right and answer plus

566
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
five that's right and answer plus
 

567
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,590
five that's right and answer plus
equals one

568
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600

 

569
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,870

left back yeah wait time how do you know

570
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
left back yeah wait time how do you know
 

571
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,750
left back yeah wait time how do you know
first thing what i need to answer yeah

572
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
first thing what i need to answer yeah
 

573
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,949
first thing what i need to answer yeah
you'll be single look

574
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
you'll be single look
 

575
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,430
you'll be single look
if it's zero i divide it by five and

576
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
if it's zero i divide it by five and
 

577
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,150
if it's zero i divide it by five and
then i can

578
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
then i can
 

579
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,430
then i can
count it add it right why

580
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
count it add it right why
 

581
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,509
count it add it right why
why this helps why this is okay

582
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
why this helps why this is okay
 

583
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,030
why this helps why this is okay
why this is okay you don't know

584
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
why this is okay you don't know
 

585
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,629
why this is okay you don't know
look if it's 25 look 25

586
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
look if it's 25 look 25
 

587
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,990
look if it's 25 look 25
you should give me how many five 25

588
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
you should give me how many five 25
 

589
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,470
you should give me how many five 25
one two one times two times times 25

590
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
one two one times two times times 25
 

591
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,829
one two one times two times times 25
will be three five yes

592
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
will be three five yes
 

593
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,350
will be three five yes
25 divided by 5 is 5

594
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
25 divided by 5 is 5
 

595
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,790
25 divided by 5 is 5
answer plus 2 yeah look

596
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
answer plus 2 yeah look
 

597
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,189
answer plus 2 yeah look
25 25 divided by

598
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
25 25 divided by
 

599
00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:04,069
25 25 divided by
5 is 5.

600
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079

 

601
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,629

n is 25 n is 25 factorial

602
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:08,639
n is 25 n is 25 factorial
 

603
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,550
n is 25 n is 25 factorial
so how many fives are in there 10

604
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
so how many fives are in there 10
 

605
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,949
so how many fives are in there 10
no i mean the whole answer one times two

606
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
no i mean the whole answer one times two
 

607
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,710
no i mean the whole answer one times two
times three times four

608
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
times three times four
 

609
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,230
times three times four
times five one there they are

610
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
times five one there they are
 

611
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,269
times five one there they are
five ten fifteen twenty

612
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
five ten fifteen twenty
 

613
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,150
five ten fifteen twenty
twenty five they are one two three four

614
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
twenty five they are one two three four
 

615
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,949
twenty five they are one two three four
five so at

616
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
five so at
 

617
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,590
five so at
25 divided by five is five i answer add

618
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600
25 divided by five is five i answer add
 

619
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,230
25 divided by five is five i answer add
to five

620
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
to five
 

621
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,430
to five
okay so that's and then five divided by

622
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
okay so that's and then five divided by
 

623
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,470
okay so that's and then five divided by
five equals one

624
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
five equals one
 

625
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,790
five equals one
i answer add one more plus one so it's

626
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
i answer add one more plus one so it's
 

627
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,110
i answer add one more plus one so it's
six

628
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120

 

629
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,629

is it how disgust yeah look at the first

630
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
is it how disgust yeah look at the first
 

631
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,189
is it how disgust yeah look at the first
thing

632
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
thing
 

633
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,230
thing
i divided by five and then

634
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
i divided by five and then
 

635
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,430
i divided by five and then
i can see how many how many count

636
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
i can see how many how many count
 

637
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,710
i can see how many how many count
how many five time table right and then

638
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720
how many five time table right and then
 

639
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:52,949
how many five time table right and then
i

640
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
i
 

641
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,389
i
again divided by five the last 25 time

642
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
again divided by five the last 25 time
 

643
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:56,870
again divided by five the last 25 time
table

644
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
table
 

645
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,790
table
yes yes and i again divided by five

646
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:00,800
yes yes and i again divided by five
 

647
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,949
yes yes and i again divided by five
that's what time table 125

648
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
that's what time table 125
 

649
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,710
that's what time table 125
times table so these these were

650
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
times table so these these were
 

651
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,150
times table so these these were
and do we have another way of doing it

652
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
and do we have another way of doing it
 

653
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,189
and do we have another way of doing it
is the similar the same

654
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
is the similar the same
 

655
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,749
is the similar the same
so we can say this math we can say

656
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
so we can say this math we can say
 

657
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,710
so we can say this math we can say
current multiple

658
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
current multiple
 

659
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,990
current multiple
okay so answer answer equals

660
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
okay so answer answer equals
 

661
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,350
okay so answer answer equals
zero and now we we have let's say power

662
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,360
zero and now we we have let's say power
 

663
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,069
zero and now we we have let's say power
of five

664
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
of five
 

665
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,590
of five
power of five equals what five

666
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
power of five equals what five
 

667
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,949
power of five equals what five
why why what

668
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
why why what
 

669
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,990

power five and then power five
times equals five and then return

684
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
times equals five and then return
 

685
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,389
times equals five and then return
written one

686
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:02,399

 

687
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,829

answer yes answer so it's the same thing

688
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
answer yes answer so it's the same thing
 

689
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,870
answer yes answer so it's the same thing
as look look

690
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
as look look
 

691
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,990
as look look
it's previously start from uh

692
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000

 

693
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,110

look this is five and then i

694
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
look this is five and then i
 

695
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,309
look this is five and then i
answer and divided by five and then

696
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
answer and divided by five and then
 

697
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,350
answer and divided by five and then
n divided by 25 and

698
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
n divided by 25 and
 

699
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,710
n divided by 25 and
n divided by 125 yeah this goes in yeah

700
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
n divided by 125 yeah this goes in yeah
 

701
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,630
n divided by 125 yeah this goes in yeah
yeah yeah yeah again and again yeah

702
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
yeah yeah yeah again and again yeah
 

703
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,390
yeah yeah yeah again and again yeah
so this complexity is better is better

704
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
so this complexity is better is better
 

705
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,750
so this complexity is better is better
so what what's the complexity

706
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760

 

707
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,350

what's the complexity what's the combat

708
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
what's the complexity what's the combat
 

709
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,190
what's the complexity what's the combat
when the complexity you can ignore this

710
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
when the complexity you can ignore this
 

711
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,710
when the complexity you can ignore this
you just ignore this yeah

712
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
you just ignore this yeah
 

713
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,870
you just ignore this yeah
look yeah so the complexities is oh

714
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
look yeah so the complexities is oh
 

715
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,110
look yeah so the complexities is oh
what

716
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120

 

717
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,470

log five base n right because this

718
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
log five base n right because this
 

719
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,830
log five base n right because this
yeah yeah because look times five times

720
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
yeah yeah because look times five times
 

721
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,710
yeah yeah because look times five times
five and here

722
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
five and here
 

723
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,470
five and here
bigger than that right is it

724
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
bigger than that right is it
 

725
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,830
bigger than that right is it
no five ten no base

726
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
no five ten no base
 

727
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,029
no five ten no base
five and and yeah is it true

728
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
five and and yeah is it true
 

729
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:31,830
five and and yeah is it true
let me just think about it yes yes

730
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840

 

731
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,190

yes because because that was a long time

732
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
yes because because that was a long time
 

733
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,630
yes because because that was a long time
away

734
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:36,640
away
 

735
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,070
away
uh this is basically the same as look

736
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
uh this is basically the same as look
 

737
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,190
uh this is basically the same as look
because every time 5 5

738
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
because every time 5 5
 

739
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,669
because every time 5 5
and then the next one is 25 and the next

740
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
and then the next one is 25 and the next
 

741
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,230
and then the next one is 25 and the next
one is 125 right

742
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
one is 125 right
 

743
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,669
one is 125 right
so it's every time is 5 to the power of

744
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
so it's every time is 5 to the power of
 

745
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,150
so it's every time is 5 to the power of
x should be smaller

746
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,160
x should be smaller
 

747
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,190
x should be smaller
is equal to n right so this

748
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
is equal to n right so this
 

749
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,950
is equal to n right so this
n this n

750
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
n this n
 

751
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,430
n this n
5 to the power of x equals n then what

752
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
5 to the power of x equals n then what
 

753
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,630
5 to the power of x equals n then what
can we do

754
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
can we do
 

755
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,230
can we do
so x is log phi

756
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,240
so x is log phi
 

757
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,350
so x is log phi
n right yeah yeah so the complexity is

758
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
n right yeah yeah so the complexity is
 

759
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,510
n right yeah yeah so the complexity is
is this one it's the same as previous

760
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
is this one it's the same as previous
 

761
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,190
is this one it's the same as previous
log

the one
 

771
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,909

00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
previously like answer equals zero
 

773
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,750
previously like answer equals zero
y we divided by

774
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
y we divided by
 

775
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,070
y we divided by
divided by five what how do you get this

776
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
divided by five what how do you get this
 

777
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,669
divided by five what how do you get this
n yeah and

778
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679

779
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,430

781
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,830

answer plus equal one

782
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:50,840
answer plus equal one
 

783
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,990
answer plus equal one
and

784
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000

 

785
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,150

actually it should be n it should be

786
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
actually it should be n it should be
 

787
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,669
actually it should be n it should be
divided by five first

788
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
divided by five first
 

789
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,909
divided by five first
yeah yeah and and yeah return

790
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
yeah yeah and and yeah return
 

791
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,710
yeah yeah and and yeah return
return answer it's the same thing yeah

792
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
return answer it's the same thing yeah
 

793
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,430
return answer it's the same thing yeah
so this is

794
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
so this is
 

795
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,149
so this is
also every time divided every time i

796
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
also every time divided every time i
 

797
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,510
also every time divided every time i
divide it by five

798
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
divide it by five
 

799
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,710
divide it by five
and then

800
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:12,720

 

801
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,350

yeah and then because look only n is

802
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
yeah and then because look only n is
 

803
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,350
yeah and then because look only n is
five if divided by five will be one and

804
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
five if divided by five will be one and
 

805
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,110
five if divided by five will be one and
the plus equals one okay

806
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
the plus equals one okay
 

807
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,909
the plus equals one okay
so written answer so let that complexity

808
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
so written answer so let that complexity
 

809
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:22,149
so written answer so let that complexity
is

810
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:22,159
is
 

811
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,950
is
still the same all right okay okay so

812
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
still the same all right okay okay so
 

813
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,750
still the same all right okay okay so
now

814
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:25,760
now
 

815
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,710
