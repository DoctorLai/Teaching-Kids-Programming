1
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:10,580
you know the browser right you visit the

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,580
internet your browser right

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,599
is that software

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,940
you open the browser right that's how

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,380
you spell it yes what blouse are you

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,720
using

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,220
is it

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,460
ping is a search engine

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,740
so what's the name of the software Edge

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,560
yes and also

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,640
what's that browser from Google what is

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:39,180
it called Shrine Chrome yeah Chrome yeah

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,460
okay so these are two popular browsers

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,719
five songs when did you use the Firefox

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,180
never

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,840
how do you know a Firefox

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,840
Island okay

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,200
Safari yes

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,680
I don't know how to spray it okay but

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,320
anyway browser is the software

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,020
[Music]

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,840
s-a-a-f-a-r-i okay so browser right

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,780
so there's a close button right let's

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,460
maximize button there's a minimize

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,380
button so what's here usually

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,920
https what do you call it it's a dress

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,920
bar right

28
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:24,799
so you put HTTP s column

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,520
www.google for example like Google or

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,520
microsoft.com

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:40,680
we call this thing u r l u r i right the

32
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,119
very minimum difference between these

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,579
two terms so URL what's that uniform

34
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,200
resource location uniform resource

35
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,540
identifier

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,659
uniform

37
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,079
they're wearing clothes or unified it's

38
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,579
a uniform or unified you need five I

39
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,619
think it's Unified

40
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,040
which one makes more sense uniformal

41
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,600
unified unified unified unified resource

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,720
resource

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,420
get back okay anyway it's just a termite

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,420
and this is identified

45
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,360
okay so let's talk about this Uriah

46
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,360
http

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,360
www.bing

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,280
dot com

49
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,020
slash

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:35,040
a slash b c dot PSP

51
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:40,560
question mark a equals one and

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:43,500
okay b equals two hashtag V okay

53
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,500
so this is a more complex example okay

54
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,420
so when you put these in a address bars

55
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,000
of a browser and the browser knows where

56
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,700
to locate this content okay and display

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,140
it in your browser okay so let's look at

58
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,099
these first

59
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:02,280
as TTP

60
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:04,620
HTTP is a protocol is a schema

61
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,720
protocol so what does this stand for

62
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,360
there's also yahoo.com

63
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,429
yes it's a difference

64
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,429
[Music]

65
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:17,700
it's also a search engine

66
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,700
nowadays it's not as popular as Google

67
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,760
Google has at least 97 market share of

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,819
the all the social engine and pin has

69
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,920
like three percent Okay Yahoo maybe less

70
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:33,420
than you know small amount of people

71
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:37,860
using these days HTTP hyper test I don't

72
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:41,300
like Yahoo hypertext twice full okay

73
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,300
transfer protocol

74
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:52,519
yeah look that's a good question Ash

75
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:56,280
t t p okay hypertext transfer

76
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:58,920
okay yeah what are the Alternatives this

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,440
is not usually when you want to view a

78
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,459
website you know type in a browser lots

79
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,159
of case HTTP or https

80
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,220
a skewer version secure version okay

81
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,700
usually it's https most of the case

82
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:19,220
okay I love FTP

83
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,220
fire transfer protocol

84
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,080
protocol what's the what's the meaning

85
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,520
of protocol

86
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,800
is that protocol okay so I want to talk

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,139
to you in secret so for example Ryan is

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,419
here I want to talk to you in secret

89
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,580
he's listening as well right I want to

90
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,919
send you a message talk to you a message

91
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,320
but in the meantime only you understand

92
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,880
right and don't understand so this is

93
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,440
there is a protocol secret protocol

94
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,919
between you and remember we talk about

95
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:51,720
this rods 13 right notation

96
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:53,400
you mean they to end okay half is so

97
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,199
thirteen each and then they swap around

98
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,060
yeah yes well right something like that

99
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,020
right I send you something I you

100
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,600
understand this is the original text

101
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:06,000
with Ryan crap because yeah that's the

102
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,160
thing so secure we have a skill version

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,100
uh we talk about it's more complex skill

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,960
version is that I encrypt the message

105
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,940
you know here is message I say hello

106
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,419
hello this is I want to talk to you Ryan

107
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,419
is here

108
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,620
the name

109
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,660
yes okay hello I want to say hello hello

110
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,620
Eric

111
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,900
okay but why is also mayor but I don't

112
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,419
want Ryan to understand this message so

113
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,280
I will have uh I will have your public

114
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:41,699
key right you have a public key you have

115
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,220
a private key in pairs yeah public key

116
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,780
you have a private key

117
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,280
so you're probably I know your public

118
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,560
key right so I probably

119
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,740
the king takes the message takes the

120
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,440
message and also your public key

121
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,060
and then this will give me uh some in

122
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,340
quickly text

123
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,340
right so this encrypted text

124
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,180
reach your side because you have private

125
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,520
key you'll be able to decode this

126
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,800
message Ryan doesn't have a private key

127
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,320
of yours this is your private only you

128
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,699
and you know you have it no other people

129
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,320
have it that they don't have your

130
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,360
private key right and don't have your

131
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,120
private key you have your private key

132
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,000
but everybody knows your public key so I

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,160
use your public key and what's my public

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,680
key I don't know it's just a publicly

135
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,400
and private piece is in pairs right only

136
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,280
this private key can see the message

137
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,139
which is being encoded using or public

138
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,500
key okay so that's very complex I don't

139
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,500
know what's my

140
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:51,319
Minecraft me like translated to like a

141
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:56,100
regular like like if you say uh like ABS

142
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:59,639
SDS one two four eight dollars convert

143
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:03,180
uh your message into uh like

144
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,680
um a code and then you send it that's my

145
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,560
private key

146
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,220
does my private key conver translated

147
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,940
back so I know yeah yeah the problem of

148
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,940
this one is what if it's Dwayne guess a

149
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,120
to n b to o or he will be able to decode

150
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:23,639
the message right because it's two-way

151
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,300
right you get the a you translate to n

152
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,979
and I send it n to you you know n so

153
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,699
it's a bit back to a

154
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:36,180
am I so it's kind of like a very simple

155
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:38,280
protocol right to guess

156
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,900
but with this approach

157
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,000
Ryan come

158
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,860
to decoy because Brian doesn't have your

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,580
private key private key could be a very

160
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:50,639
big thing uh you know a key that nobody

161
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:53,940
can decode your message without it okay

162
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,340
okay so let's protocol so FTP and also

163
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,380
we have a skilled version what's my

164
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,419
public key though

165
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,120
it could be any you can make up a public

166
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,580
Republic equipment it could be a limited

167
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,620
number like it just comes in pair okay

168
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,039
we talk about that later it's quite

169
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,539
complex it's about the encryption

170
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:15,240
cryptographic okay cryptographic this is

171
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:17,400
the foundation of blockchain okay so

172
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,979
this is a schema or we call it protocol

173
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,660
schema

174
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,940
www what's that

175
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,139
[Music]

176
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:31,280
worldwide website okay so this could be

177
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,280
it could be something else

178
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:39,260
technically www is a supplement so it

179
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:41,700
could be you know I could say video

180
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:45,000
video.bing.com so people know this

181
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,980
video.bing.com is a sub domain sub

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,320
domain of bing.com this is the main

183
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,240
domain everything before the mentorman

184
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,240
is the supplement so videos

185
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:01,399
no HTTP this is the protocol this is the

186
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,399
domain here this is

187
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:08,760
okay okay technically after this right

188
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,820
this is the schema protocol this is a

189
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:15,420
domain man domain subtle man okay

190
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,700
okay and why.com what's.com company

191
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:21,899
company okay originally the one that

192
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:24,899
domain was invented uh.com is the uh top

193
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:28,740
level government TRD okay so.com company

194
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:31,380
right but nowadays the mods

195
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:36,000
TRD is coming right we could have duck

196
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:39,000
UK Taco dot UK dot io.net right

197
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,519
anything right

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,380
and then these are the paths right so it

199
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,019
means that where to find

200
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:49,740
what weighs the past a no you can

201
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:52,800
imagine as a photo structure a photo

202
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:56,339
goes into a folder and then B photo and

203
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:00,360
then in a for the B photo there's a c do

204
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:04,980
php5 so this is the nude right so load

205
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,980
laser photo a and let's further B and in

206
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,860
photo B I have at least see the PHP so

207
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,320
this is just to tell the uh browser

208
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,519
Telltale server where to locate the zero

209
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:21,120
PHP is at the server of bing.com at

210
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,360
photo a for the BN okay location PHP

211
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,660
okay so this is a file okay any

212
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,940
questions so far and that is one part

213
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,600
one pass yes one pass yes it could be

214
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,600
any pass right

215
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,220
and how do I know my private key without

216
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,380
telling it to you

217
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,000
you have your primary key okay so you

218
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,000
don't share your private key to anybody

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,399
else you don't tell me okay this is so

220
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,860
perfect it only belongs to you yeah but

221
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,860
how would I know where to look without

222
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,140
you helping me Ah that's a good question

223
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,620
yeah because when you are uh and you are

224
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:07,920
18 I'm your official you know Guardian

225
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,580
so I deserve to know everything yeah

226
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,860
sometimes even your password

227
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,779
[Music]

228
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,500
okay

229
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:19,740
okay what was the question again sorry

230
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,760
there's only one part so you can find it

231
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,760
okay yes

232
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:30,120
you only can go to B okay okay maybe I

233
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,480
have another C and I have another T and

234
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,980
I have another E and I have a f okay so

235
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,700
we don't know the structure of the

236
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,019
server but if you put it this way then

237
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:44,220
you'll actually be telling people that

238
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:46,260
okay on my server a b c the PHP you need

239
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,740
to find it okay most of the case but

240
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,360
actually this is the case we serve the

241
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,220
fire is there in most cases but

242
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,399
sometimes we can save it okay now let's

243
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,519
totally another story okay

244
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,579
so look this is the question mark and

245
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,040
after this before the hashtag this is

246
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:07,440
the core query string

247
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,399
clear history why do you need a question

248
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,399
mark

249
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,380
this is just the format right before the

250
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,720
question mark this is the file name this

251
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,640
is the task after the question mark is

252
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,519
the it's optional by the way okay this

253
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,980
is optional and this is optional as well

254
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,800
if we don't specify left

255
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,660
anything so what to look for is by

256
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,519
default right the server can configure

257
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,060
it as well the by default is looking for

258
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,060
index

259
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,500
index.html dot PHP or whatever right so

260
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,920
we don't know buy before we can

261
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,600
configure the server to go to a default

262
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,200
fire

263
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,000
when the past is not given okay so after

264
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,519
the question mark we can give a credit

265
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,860
string query string look a DOT one a

266
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,839
equals one and b equals two basically

267
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,540
we're just passing two variables to say

268
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:01,620
a equals one and b equals two to release

269
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,839
C dot PHP so instead of PHP we we know a

270
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,540
equals one and b equals two that could

271
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,180
be multiple right so you could say a

272
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:12,360
equals one and b equals two and C equals

273
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,959
three and D equals four whatever blah

274
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,779
blah blah okay and hashtag hashtag

275
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:21,540
this is just taking so when you open the

276
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,040
browser right when you have a page HTML

277
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,680
page

278
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,320
right so so for example right you have

279
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,079
uh something here blah blah blah you

280
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,779
guys you know some text some text some

281
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,899
text so if I'm saying here I want to tag

282
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:40,519
it as V here right this is a there's a

283
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:44,160
tagging V here so if you type in

284
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:46,079
the browser or when you open it

285
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,100
you were jumped

286
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:53,000
immediately to this section V okay make

287
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,160
sense they all we call it anchor

288
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,320
a-n-c-h-o-r Okay so

289
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,320
the only thing you need to know is that

290
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,680
this is for the browsers to jump to the

291
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,360
corresponding section if there's a tag

292
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,440
here

293
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,120
okay

294
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,510
so any questions so far what have you

295
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,820
learned today

296
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,740
[Music]

297
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,899
no we are not in your browser we're

298
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,899
learning about that whatever web

299
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:21,420
computer thingy blah blah that uh blah

300
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:24,899
blah you are air remember yeah yeah okay

301
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:28,100
so I'm going to uh we learned about URI

302
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,100
Yuri okay area

303
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,100
yeah yeah

304
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,920
okay so I'm going to write a few UI you

305
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:44,180
tell me if it's a uniform uh if it's uh

306
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,180
you tell me if it's uh correct URL okay

307
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:57,199
Okay C dot PHP is this a UI

308
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,199
what's amazing

309
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,720
yes yeah and that's the thing okay

310
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,680
actually I forgot something okay http

311
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,139
okay

312
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,040
s y this is secure version a video

313
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:15,360
Dot

314
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,779
thing

315
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,779
.com okay so there's a column afterwards

316
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,779
https

317
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
sorry

318
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:32,600
and then they're supposed to be column

319
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,600
after HTTP yeah yeah yeah they are okay

320
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:38,339
double slash yes okay so what I'm not

321
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,860
missing here okay by default it's

322
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:43,199
optional right by default if we don't

323
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,720
give it it's 80 80 means the web server

324
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,420
right you could give another Port so

325
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,120
what what is the pot so pot is just a

326
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,480
number right so there are some reserved

327
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:59,420
for example 80 is the web server 443 is

328
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,279
the https right uh some other like

329
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,320
FTP

330
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,019
2223 which you don't need to know for

331
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,199
now so Port is just like you know I can

332
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:12,000
talk to Eric right Eric is a server

333
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,579
bing.com right for example I want to

334
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,860
talk to Ari impaire you know in Paris

335
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:19,500
for example I want to talk to every part

336
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,440
80 and Eric should tell me okay so

337
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,899
present a page that's a website web

338
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,260
server so it's just basically a channel

339
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:31,800
right so a however this is a server a

340
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:34,560
port 80 it handles it handles the web

341
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,180
server the web pages and other ports it

342
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,220
do something else

343
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,459
can you imagine that right it could be a

344
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,160
have a a lot of ports

345
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:46,160
these are the parts right it's a just

346
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,300
like we can talk to each Port

347
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,339
individually without affecting each

348
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,800
other okay each pole handles the same

349
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,660
thing okay yeah all right doesn't make

350
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,199
sense yeah

351
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,199
okay https

352
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:05,579
picture oh

353
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:10,919
abc.com dot UK

354
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:14,579
column 91 slash C slash D and question

355
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:15,900
mark a equals one

356
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,600
tag

357
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,520
D okay it doesn't like show Bing or

358
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,500
Google that's that's okay it could be

359
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,500
anything that's the UI okay that's not

360
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,179
my question my question is that where is

361
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,240
the port number which one is the problem

362
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,540
91 91 this is the whole number well

363
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,120
that's the only number basically

364
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:39,059
okay okay yeah you all right Paul number

365
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,380
okay Paul number 54 if we don't specify

366
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,380
anything that's 80 okay

367
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,369
[Music]

368
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,380
the fire lamb is missing but the fire

369
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,600
line is missing it should be here but if

370
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,380
it's missing most likely it's index okay

371
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,500
