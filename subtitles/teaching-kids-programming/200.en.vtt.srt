00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,630

hello hello mr ryan how are you today

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:04,640
hello hello mr ryan how are you today
 

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,390
hello hello mr ryan how are you today
good and today is about rotating images

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
good and today is about rotating images
 

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,030
good and today is about rotating images
rotating images yes the me means 2d

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
rotating images yes the me means 2d
 

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,350
rotating images yes the me means 2d
magic okay

8
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
magic okay
 

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:21,269
magic okay
rotate

10
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:21,279

 

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,589

one two three that's the magic yeah

12
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
one two three that's the magic yeah
 

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,830
one two three that's the magic yeah
yeah we want to rotate clockwise

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
yeah we want to rotate clockwise
 

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:40,549
yeah we want to rotate clockwise
clockwise

16
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559

 

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,150

yeah anticlockwise we can talk about

18
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
yeah anticlockwise we can talk about
 

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,549
yeah anticlockwise we can talk about
antifungals tomorrow okay today just

20
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
antifungals tomorrow okay today just
 

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,670
antifungals tomorrow okay today just
clockwise

22
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
clockwise
 

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,150
clockwise
so here two clockwise you become

24
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
so here two clockwise you become
 

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,869
so here two clockwise you become
what you become you'll become one it

26
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
what you become you'll become one it
 

27
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,310
what you become you'll become one it
will become

28
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
will become
 

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,430
will become
one two three one four

30
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
one two three one four
 

31
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,110
one two three one four
seven two five eight three no so you can

32
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
seven two five eight three no so you can
 

33
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,510
seven two five eight three no so you can
turn these uh away so that will be these

34
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
turn these uh away so that will be these
 

35
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,390
turn these uh away so that will be these
will be seven

36
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
will be seven
 

37
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,590
will be seven
four one eight five two nine six three

38
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
four one eight five two nine six three
 

39
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,710
four one eight five two nine six three
eight five four eight five two

40
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720
eight five four eight five two
 

41
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,950
eight five four eight five two
eight eighty-five to six nine three okay

42
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
eight eighty-five to six nine three okay
 

43
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,710
eight eighty-five to six nine three okay
so you turn this string

44
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
so you turn this string
 

45
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,230
so you turn this string
okay yeah so before we

46
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
okay yeah so before we
 

47
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,550
okay yeah so before we
come up the solution for the rotating uh

48
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
come up the solution for the rotating uh
 

49
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,670
come up the solution for the rotating uh
do you still remember

50
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
do you still remember
 

51
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,749
do you still remember
what's the transpose one for seventeen

52
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
what's the transpose one for seventeen
 

53
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,030
what's the transpose one for seventeen
like like that one two three four five

54
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
like like that one two three four five
 

55
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,350
like like that one two three four five
six seven eight nine how can we write

56
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
six seven eight nine how can we write
 

57
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,870
six seven eight nine how can we write
the transfers can you one four

58
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
the transfers can you one four
 

59
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,910
the transfers can you one four
seven one four seven two

60
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
seven one four seven two
 

61
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,510
seven one four seven two
five eight two five eight

62
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
five eight two five eight
 

63
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,230
five eight two five eight
three six nine three six to nine okay so

64
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
three six nine three six to nine okay so
 

65
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,789
three six nine three six to nine okay so
what's

66
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
what's
 

67
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,149
what's
what's big transposing mean what does it

68
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
what's big transposing mean what does it
 

69
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,429
what's big transposing mean what does it
mean

70
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
mean
 

71
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,190
mean
how do you how do you transfer the

72
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200

 

73
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,749

what magic do you do it how do you come

74
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
what magic do you do it how do you come
 

75
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,550
what magic do you do it how do you come
up with leaf

76
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560

 

77
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,389

i mean what what you turn it around

78
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
i mean what what you turn it around
 

79
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,429
i mean what what you turn it around
and you click and you reverse the

80
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
and you click and you reverse the
 

81
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,030
and you click and you reverse the
columns

82
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
columns
 

83
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,070
columns
but okay but most intuitively how to do

84
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
but okay but most intuitively how to do
 

85
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,070
but okay but most intuitively how to do
this

86
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
this
 

87
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,070
this
you know about how do you look one two

88
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
you know about how do you look one two
 

89
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,589
you know about how do you look one two
three four and how do you

90
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599

 

91
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,309

what's this transpose one three two four

92
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
what's this transpose one three two four
 

93
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,869
what's this transpose one three two four
one three four yes and what's this

94
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
one three four yes and what's this
 

95
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,630
one three four yes and what's this
how do you know it's one three two four

96
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640

 

97
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,830

come on it's very old three two four one

98
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
come on it's very old three two four one
 

99
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,110
come on it's very old three two four one
ah okay so yeah what i'm saying is this

100
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
ah okay so yeah what i'm saying is this
 

101
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,550
ah okay so yeah what i'm saying is this
the diagonal is mapping so look

102
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
the diagonal is mapping so look
 

103
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,869
the diagonal is mapping so look
it's wrapped with diamond two and four

104
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
it's wrapped with diamond two and four
 

105
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,550
it's wrapped with diamond two and four
swap it

106
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
swap it
 

107
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,509
swap it
seven and three swap it anything along

108
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
seven and three swap it anything along
 

109
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:43,990
seven and three swap it anything along
there

110
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
there
 

111
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,910
there
eight and six working right that's how

112
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
eight and six working right that's how
 

113
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,030
eight and six working right that's how
you go to transpose

114
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
you go to transpose
 

115
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,229
you go to transpose
correct yeah makes sense and

116
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
correct yeah makes sense and
 

117
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,910
correct yeah makes sense and
the transpose this is n times n

118
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
the transpose this is n times n
 

119
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,710
the transpose this is n times n
mental it can be any size for example

120
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
mental it can be any size for example
 

121
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,149
mental it can be any size for example
one two

122
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
one two
 

123
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,670
one two
three four five six this is this is

124
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
three four five six this is this is
 

125
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,070
three four five six this is this is
three row times two columns right when

126
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
three row times two columns right when
 

127
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,229
three row times two columns right when
you transpose it you'll become two rows

128
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
you transpose it you'll become two rows
 

129
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,430
you transpose it you'll become two rows
and three columns

130
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
and three columns
 

131
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,550
and three columns
okay so how do you transpose these

132
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
okay so how do you transpose these
 

133
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,990
okay so how do you transpose these
this is another number how do you

134
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
this is another number how do you
 

135
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,229
this is another number how do you
transfer this one three five

136
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
transfer this one three five
 

137
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,149
transfer this one three five
four six so one three five two four six

138
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
four six so one three five two four six
 

139
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,110
four six so one three five two four six
right you see three rows two columns

140
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
right you see three rows two columns
 

141
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,790
right you see three rows two columns
becomes two rows three columns

142
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
becomes two rows three columns
 

143
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,390
becomes two rows three columns
okay yeah and you transpose it here

144
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
okay yeah and you transpose it here
 

145
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,509
okay yeah and you transpose it here
here at the beginning you'll be column

146
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
here at the beginning you'll be column
 

147
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,550
here at the beginning you'll be column
three row number three

148
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
three row number three
 

149
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,229
three row number three
zero one two two rows and zero column

150
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
zero one two two rows and zero column
 

151
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,750
zero one two two rows and zero column
and then now you become

152
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
and then now you become
 

153
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,589
and then now you become
zero and two column so which is zero

154
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
zero and two column so which is zero
 

155
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,070
zero and two column so which is zero
and two column five yeah look right

156
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
and two column five yeah look right
 

157
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,710
and two column five yeah look right
right

158
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
right
 

159
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,990
right
you see yeah

160
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
you see yeah
 

161
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,670
you see yeah
so the transpose

162
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
so the transpose
 

163
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,509
so the transpose
let's review this transfers first and

164
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
let's review this transfers first and
 

165
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,110
let's review this transfers first and
then we can talk about it a transpose

166
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
then we can talk about it a transpose
 

167
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,149
then we can talk about it a transpose
okay

168
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
okay
 

169
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,990
okay
define transpose

170
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
define transpose
 

171
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,350
define transpose
transpose a metric a what's missing

172
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
transpose a metric a what's missing
 

173
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,030
transpose a metric a what's missing
every time if not a okay then we return

174
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
every time if not a okay then we return
 

175
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,589
every time if not a okay then we return
nothing okay we can or nothing between

176
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
nothing okay we can or nothing between
 

177
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,030
nothing okay we can or nothing between
nine

178
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
nine
 

179
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,869
nine
okay because if it's an empty you can't

180
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
okay because if it's an empty you can't
 

181
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,430
okay because if it's an empty you can't
transpose it

182
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
transpose it
 

183
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,349
transpose it
yeah okay and then we need to find the

184
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
yeah okay and then we need to find the
 

185
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,909
yeah okay and then we need to find the
rows first rows and columns

186
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
rows first rows and columns
 

187
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,430
rows first rows and columns
so look rows right

188
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
so look rows right
 

189
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,270
so look rows right
and columns equals length a

190
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
and columns equals length a
 

191
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,629
and columns equals length a
that's the rows yeah and columns what's

192
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
that's the rows yeah and columns what's
 

193
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,189
that's the rows yeah and columns what's
the length how do you write the columns

194
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
the length how do you write the columns
 

195
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,870
the length how do you write the columns
length a y a

196
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
length a y a
 

197
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,469
length a y a
0 the first row right come

198
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479

 

199
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,830

so now we've got these we call this

200
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
so now we've got these we call this
 

201
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,469
so now we've got these we call this
we call the rows and columns and then

202
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
we call the rows and columns and then
 

203
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,189
we call the rows and columns and then
now

204
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
now
 

205
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,870
now
because the transpose one it will be

206
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
because the transpose one it will be
 

207
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,790
because the transpose one it will be
the columns will become rows the rows

208
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
the columns will become rows the rows
 

209
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,230
the columns will become rows the rows
will become columns right

210
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
will become columns right
 

211
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,390
will become columns right
yeah so let's say the target the answer

212
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
yeah so let's say the target the answer
 

213
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,990
yeah so let's say the target the answer
okay the target t

214
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
okay the target t
 

215
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,830
okay the target t
equals at the beginning okay zero

216
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
equals at the beginning okay zero
 

217
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,350
equals at the beginning okay zero
for in range

218
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
for in range
 

219
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,430
for in range
at the beginning will be rows rows will

220
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
at the beginning will be rows rows will
 

221
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,590
at the beginning will be rows rows will
be the columns and rows

222
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
be the columns and rows
 

223
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,510
be the columns and rows
and then for underscore in

224
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
and then for underscore in
 

225
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,710
and then for underscore in
range when you

226
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720

 

227
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,029

so what this means is that at the

228
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
so what this means is that at the
 

229
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,790
so what this means is that at the
beginning is two times three and then

230
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
beginning is two times three and then
 

231
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,110
beginning is two times three and then
you

232
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
you
 

233
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,350
you
i will allocate a t which is three times

234
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
i will allocate a t which is three times
 

235
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,390
i will allocate a t which is three times
two right

236
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
two right
 

237
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,870
two right
right and then i can just go through

238
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
right and then i can just go through
 

239
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,070
right and then i can just go through
this original

240
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
this original
 

241
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,710
this original
metric for r in range

242
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720

243
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,150
metric for r in range
range one rows right column

244
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
range one rows right column
 

245
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,830
range one rows right column
for column in range

246
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
for column in range
 

247
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,710
for column in range
columns okay so this is interesting

248
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
columns okay so this is interesting
 

249
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,830
columns okay so this is interesting

what what equals the original matrix is

252
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
what what equals the original matrix is
 

253
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,430
what what equals the original matrix is
a

254
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
a
 

255
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,469
a
a r c and here

256
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
a r c and here
 

257
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,749
a r c and here
what should i put brian

258
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
what should i put brian
 

259
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,909
what should i put brian
this is rc from the arushina and here

260
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
this is rc from the arushina and here
 

261
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,790
this is rc from the arushina and here
will be uh

262
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
will be uh
 

263
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,790
will be uh
this transpose one will be what

264
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800

 

265
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,510

the where then well got it you already

266
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
the where then well got it you already
 

267
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,070
the where then well got it you already
got it

268
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
got it
 

269
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,390
got it
ci the opposite that's why i said two

270
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
ci the opposite that's why i said two
 

271
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,990
ci the opposite that's why i said two
times three becomes three times two

272
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
times three becomes three times two
 

273
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,189
times three becomes three times two
so this is the choice

274
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199

 

275
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,790

which one will be returning

276
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800

 

277
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,950

t yeah we want to return the transfer

278
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
t yeah we want to return the transfer
 

279
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,550
t yeah we want to return the transfer
okay now this is the transpose

280
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
okay now this is the transpose
 

281
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,309
okay now this is the transpose
so suppose we know these principles

282
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
so suppose we know these principles
 

283
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,390
so suppose we know these principles
already the time complexity for this one

284
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
already the time complexity for this one
 

285
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,230
already the time complexity for this one
is o

286
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
is o
 

287
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,510
is o
n what's n or you can say o

288
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
n what's n or you can say o
 

289
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,629
n what's n or you can say o
right rows times y columns yeah because

290
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
right rows times y columns yeah because
 

291
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,029
right rows times y columns yeah because
there are those times columns of

292
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
there are those times columns of
 

293
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,150
there are those times columns of
elements in this magic okay space

294
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
elements in this magic okay space
 

295
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,550
elements in this magic okay space
complexity is all the same because we

296
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
complexity is all the same because we
 

297
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,510
complexity is all the same because we
are allocating

298
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
are allocating
 

299
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,710
are allocating
a new metric to retain okay

300
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
a new metric to retain okay
 

301
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,390
a new metric to retain okay
now if we know this transposing and we

302
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
now if we know this transposing and we
 

303
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,070
now if we know this transposing and we
want to rotate it

304
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
want to rotate it
 

305
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,230
want to rotate it
we can combine the transpose the first

306
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
we can combine the transpose the first
 

307
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,550
we can combine the transpose the first
step right one two three

308
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
step right one two three
 

309
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,469
step right one two three
four five six you look at me okay

310
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
four five six you look at me okay
 

311
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,790
four five six you look at me okay
when i transfer it will be one four

312
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
when i transfer it will be one four
 

313
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,510
when i transfer it will be one four
seven

314
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
seven
 

315
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,629
seven
one and one two five

316
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
one and one two five
 

317
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,990
one and one two five
eight three six nine

318
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
eight three six nine
 

319
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,029
eight three six nine
five three six nine okay the first three

320
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
five three six nine okay the first three
 

321
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,070
five three six nine okay the first three
numbers in the three time tables

322
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
numbers in the three time tables
 

323
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,230
numbers in the three time tables
yeah okay so now this is transpose and

324
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
yeah okay so now this is transpose and
 

325
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,550
yeah okay so now this is transpose and
then how can we make it here

326
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
then how can we make it here
 

327
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,749
then how can we make it here
okay i'm going to write it reversed

328
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
okay i'm going to write it reversed
 

329
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,950
okay i'm going to write it reversed
oh right

330
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960

 

331
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,670

so this is the b from here to here is

332
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
so this is the b from here to here is
 

333
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,589
so this is the b from here to here is
rotate 90 degree right

334
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
rotate 90 degree right
 

335
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,029
rotate 90 degree right
yeah from here to here is what from here

336
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
yeah from here to here is what from here
 

337
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,990
yeah from here to here is what from here
to here

338
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000

 

339
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,550

is from the second to the third one what

340
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
is from the second to the third one what
 

341
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,070
is from the second to the third one what
was the transformation

342
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
was the transformation
 

343
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,550
was the transformation
how do you get from here to here

344
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
how do you get from here to here
 

345
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,589
how do you get from here to here
universe

346
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599

 

347
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,830

yeah okay good good job so this is

348
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
yeah okay good good job so this is
 

349
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,990
yeah okay good good job so this is
transpose this is reverse issue

350
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
transpose this is reverse issue
 

351
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,430
transpose this is reverse issue
and then we go we can do it and it also

352
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
and then we go we can do it and it also
 

353
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,150
and then we go we can do it and it also
works for

354
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
works for
 

355
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,510
works for
this is end time yeah it also works for

356
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
this is end time yeah it also works for
 

357
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,430
this is end time yeah it also works for
what for like this one two three four

358
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
what for like this one two three four
 

359
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,749
what for like this one two three four
five six yeah this is three times uh

360
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
five six yeah this is three times uh
 

361
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,350
five six yeah this is three times uh
three row two column and when we

362
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
three row two column and when we
 

363
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,790
three row two column and when we
transpose it

364
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
transpose it
 

365
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,150
transpose it
we become one two rows three columns

366
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
we become one two rows three columns
 

367
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,790
we become one two rows three columns
yeah

368
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
yeah
 

369
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,909
yeah
one three four eighteen one three five

370
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
one three four eighteen one three five
 

371
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,430
one three four eighteen one three five
two four six and then we reverse it

372
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
two four six and then we reverse it
 

373
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,110
two four six and then we reverse it
reverse each row is it five three

374
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
reverse each row is it five three
 

375
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,269
reverse each row is it five three
one six fourteen

376
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
one six fourteen
 

377
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,030
one six fourteen
is it look is it yeah

378
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
is it look is it yeah
 

379
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,030
is it look is it yeah
yeah when you rotate this 90 degree

380
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
yeah when you rotate this 90 degree
 

381
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,550
yeah when you rotate this 90 degree
you'll become that so it also works for

382
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
you'll become that so it also works for
 

383
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,190
you'll become that so it also works for
these

384
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
these
 

385
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,509
these
and when the rows and columns are not

386
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
and when the rows and columns are not
 

387
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,630
and when the rows and columns are not
the same okay

388
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
the same okay
 

389
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,910
the same okay
okay so now we can write this okay good

390
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
okay so now we can write this okay good
 

391
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,269
okay so now we can write this okay good
