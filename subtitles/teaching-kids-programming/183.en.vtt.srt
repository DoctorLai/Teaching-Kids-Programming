the earth and we need a few spaceships

20
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
the earth and we need a few spaceships
 

21
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,310
the earth and we need a few spaceships
we don't need a

22
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
we don't need a
 

23
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,709
we don't need a
column okay we need we have a few

24
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
column okay we need we have a few
 

25
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,750
column okay we need we have a few
spaceships

26
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
spaceships
 

27
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,229
spaceships
rocket yeah and we have a list of people

28
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
rocket yeah and we have a list of people
 

29
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,110
rocket yeah and we have a list of people
like uh

30
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
like uh
 

31
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,470
like uh
the weight let's say 100 200.

32
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
the weight let's say 100 200.
 

33
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,670
the weight let's say 100 200.
that's gonna be a very heavy people yeah

34
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
that's gonna be a very heavy people yeah
 

35
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,389
that's gonna be a very heavy people yeah
four hundred

36
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
four hundred
 

37
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,990
four hundred
you know oh are you kidding me yeah yeah

38
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
you know oh are you kidding me yeah yeah
 

39
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,630
you know oh are you kidding me yeah yeah
okay

40
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
okay
 

41
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,750
okay
and let's say each each space each

42
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
and let's say each each space each
 

43
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,069
and let's say each each space each
market can carry the limit four hundred

44
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
market can carry the limit four hundred
 

45
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,790
market can carry the limit four hundred
yeah leave me

46
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
yeah leave me
 

47
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,310
yeah leave me
in four hundred and each spaceship can

48
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
in four hundred and each spaceship can
 

49
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,109
in four hundred and each spaceship can
only carry

50
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
only carry
 

51
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,230
only carry
at most two people right two people

52
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
at most two people right two people
 

53
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,030
at most two people right two people
so how many spaces the minimum number of

54
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
so how many spaces the minimum number of
 

55
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,109
so how many spaces the minimum number of
species do we need

56
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
species do we need
 

57
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,390
species do we need
uh to carry all those people if

58
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
uh to carry all those people if
 

59
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,670
uh to carry all those people if
if the maximum weight of each people

60
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
if the maximum weight of each people
 

61
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,710
if the maximum weight of each people
is less than the limit right three right

62
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
is less than the limit right three right
 

63
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,109
is less than the limit right three right
if

64
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
if
 

65
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,429
if
we place 500 we can't do this right

66
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
we place 500 we can't do this right
 

67
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,670
we place 500 we can't do this right
because 500 can't put into the spaceship

68
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
because 500 can't put into the spaceship
 

69
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,390
because 500 can't put into the spaceship
right

70
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
right
 

71
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,230
right
yeah so let's say if we know

72
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
yeah so let's say if we know
 

73
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,630
yeah so let's say if we know
all the people the maximum weight of the

74
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
all the people the maximum weight of the
 

75
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,830
all the people the maximum weight of the
people is less

76
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
people is less
 

77
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,830
people is less
or equal than the limit okay so how many

78
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
or equal than the limit okay so how many
 

79
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,030
or equal than the limit okay so how many
do we need how many

80
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
do we need how many
 

81
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,590
do we need how many
here three and take two tell me what

82
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
here three and take two tell me what
 

83
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,030
here three and take two tell me what
what are three

84
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
what are three
 

85
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,429
what are three
you can do one hundred two hundred two

86
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
you can do one hundred two hundred two
 

87
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,870
you can do one hundred two hundred two
hundred and four hundred

88
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
hundred and four hundred
 

89
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,469
hundred and four hundred
one hundred two hundred what and then

90
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
one hundred two hundred what and then
 

91
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,469
one hundred two hundred what and then
two hundred yeah another one

92
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
two hundred yeah another one
 

93
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,510
two hundred yeah another one
and four sorry so

94
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
and four sorry so
 

95
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,510

97
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,510
yeah come on yeah and 200 and 400. yeah
let's see

98
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520

 

99
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,590

what's the strategy of doing that

100
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:04,600
what's the strategy of doing that
 

101
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,830
what's the strategy of doing that
[Music]

102
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
[Music]
 

103
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,350
[Music]
i mean how can you all we can do is 200

104
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
i mean how can you all we can do is 200
 

105
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,070
i mean how can you all we can do is 200
200

106
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
200
 

107
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,589
200
and 100 and 400 right it's the same yeah

108
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
and 100 and 400 right it's the same yeah
 

109
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,869
and 100 and 400 right it's the same yeah
okay so let's say if i have another 200

110
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
okay so let's say if i have another 200
 

111
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,190
okay so let's say if i have another 200
here

112
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200

 

113
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,589

no no if we have another 300 here so

114
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
no no if we have another 300 here so
 

115
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,710
no no if we have another 300 here so
what how do you do this

116
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
what how do you do this
 

117
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,510
what how do you do this
then you say a 300 because there isn't

118
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
then you say a 300 because there isn't
 

119
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,750
then you say a 300 because there isn't
any 300 people

120
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
any 300 people
 

121
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,750
any 300 people
sorry what does it mean you didn't say

122
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
sorry what does it mean you didn't say
 

123
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,270
sorry what does it mean you didn't say
another 300 because

124
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
another 300 because
 

125
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,150
another 300 because
okay okay 300 okay so there's a size 300

126
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
okay okay 300 okay so there's a size 300
 

127
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,630
okay okay 300 okay so there's a size 300
so

128
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
so
 

129
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,309
so
how how should we organize these 100 300

130
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
how how should we organize these 100 300
 

131
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,390
how how should we organize these 100 300
200 200 400.

132
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
200 200 400.
 

133
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,430
200 200 400.
yes

134
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440

 

135
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,750

okay so what's the strategy oh wow

136
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
okay so what's the strategy oh wow
 

137
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,750
okay so what's the strategy oh wow
okay so you're trying to find

138
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
okay so you're trying to find
 

139
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,790
okay so you're trying to find
combinations

140
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
combinations
 

141
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,150
combinations
to the target so it's no limit

142
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
to the target so it's no limit
 

143
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,190
to the target so it's no limit
which is that

144
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
which is that
 

145
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,229
which is that
that but if there is no right if this

146
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
that but if there is no right if this
 

147
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,350
that but if there is no right if this
if this is 250 okay

148
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
if this is 250 okay
 

149
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,970
if this is 250 okay
so what if this is 180 okay so

150
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:10,980

 

151
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,670

155
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,149

okay so what's what's your strategy in

156
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
okay so what's what's your strategy in
 

157
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,910
okay so what's what's your strategy in
this case

158
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
this case
 

159
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,270
this case
okay so

160
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280

 

161
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,190

uh well

162
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
uh well
 

163
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,949
uh well
so what are you trying to do here

164
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
so what are you trying to do here
 

165
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,190
so what are you trying to do here
obviously those these are just

166
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
obviously those these are just
 

167
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,509
obviously those these are just
five numbers yes but it's easy to say we

168
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
five numbers yes but it's easy to say we
 

169
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,390
five numbers yes but it's easy to say we
only need

170
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
only need
 

171
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,910
only need
a only can have two

172
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
a only can have two
 

173
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,190
a only can have two
yeah because maximum yeah because only

174
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
yeah because maximum yeah because only
 

175
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,589
yeah because maximum yeah because only
one

176
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
one
 

177
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,270
one
spaceship can only carry two so so what

178
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
spaceship can only carry two so so what
 

179
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,949
spaceship can only carry two so so what
they must be very smooth very small

180
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
they must be very smooth very small
 

181
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,789
they must be very smooth very small
so what happens if i pick the most

182
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
so what happens if i pick the most
 

183
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,309
so what happens if i pick the most
heaviest

184
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
heaviest
 

185
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,789
heaviest
okay so for example this is 400 yeah the

186
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
okay so for example this is 400 yeah the
 

187
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,589
okay so for example this is 400 yeah the
spaceship

188
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
spaceship
 

189
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,070
spaceship
even the current maximum is 400 yeah

190
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
even the current maximum is 400 yeah
 

191
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,030
even the current maximum is 400 yeah
yeah oh maybe let's see let's say if

192
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
yeah oh maybe let's see let's say if
 

193
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,509
yeah oh maybe let's see let's say if
that

194
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
that
 

195
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,990
that
just left 300 yeah if the current

196
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
just left 300 yeah if the current
 

197
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,429
just left 300 yeah if the current
maximum is 300

198
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
maximum is 300
 

199
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,470
maximum is 300
this is the most service here i pick the

200
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
this is the most service here i pick the
 

201
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,830
this is the most service here i pick the
most harvest

202
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
most harvest
 

203
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,229
most harvest
one so because i only can pick one here

204
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
one so because i only can pick one here
 

205
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,430
one so because i only can pick one here
so do i pick the second heaviest

206
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
so do i pick the second heaviest
 

207
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,629
so do i pick the second heaviest
or the most light lightest lightest

208
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
or the most light lightest lightest
 

209
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,550
or the most light lightest lightest
why is that because heaviest heaviest uh

210
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
why is that because heaviest heaviest uh
 

211
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,990
why is that because heaviest heaviest uh
and not okay so heaviest and lightest

212
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
and not okay so heaviest and lightest
 

213
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,790
and not okay so heaviest and lightest
has my

214
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
has my
 

215
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,870
has my
nice chance of getting less than the

216
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
nice chance of getting less than the
 

217
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,830
nice chance of getting less than the
target

218
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
target
 

219
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,469
target
where the let's cook one okay so look

220
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
where the let's cook one okay so look
 

221
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,510
where the let's cook one okay so look
harry

222
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
harry
 

223
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,350
harry
if look if this lightest one

224
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
if look if this lightest one
 

225
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,629
if look if this lightest one
can go in the spaceship

226
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
can go in the spaceship
 

227
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,150
can go in the spaceship
right so it can only hit a rocket

228
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
right so it can only hit a rocket
 

229
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,230
right so it can only hit a rocket
it also what does it mean it means that

230
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
it also what does it mean it means that
 

231
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,830
it also what does it mean it means that
the slightest one can

232
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
the slightest one can
 

233
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,270
the slightest one can
also go with any other right

234
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
also go with any other right
 

235
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,710
also go with any other right
yeah why why does that oh oh oh yeah

236
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720

 

237
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,710

okay this is the most heaviest yeah the

238
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
okay this is the most heaviest yeah the
 

239
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,909
okay this is the most heaviest yeah the
most heaviest so

240
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
most heaviest so
 

241
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,230
most heaviest so
lightest it must be smaller ah

242
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
lightest it must be smaller ah
 

243
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,150
lightest it must be smaller ah
smaller than 300 and

244
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
smaller than 300 and
 

245
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,350
smaller than 300 and
and uh because it can go with

246
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
and uh because it can go with
 

247
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,350
and uh because it can go with
any yeah this is because we got 100

248
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
any yeah this is because we got 100
 

249
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,270
any yeah this is because we got 100
yeah and 300 that makes 400

250
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
yeah and 300 that makes 400
 

251
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,710
yeah and 300 that makes 400
and then and then and then that's the

252
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
and then and then and then that's the
 

253
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,670
and then and then and then that's the
biggest

254
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
biggest
 

255
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,749
biggest
greatest and when you get smaller

256
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
greatest and when you get smaller
 

257
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,790
greatest and when you get smaller
definitely smaller than the target

258
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
definitely smaller than the target
 

259
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,710
definitely smaller than the target
okay so i kind of understand what you

260
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
okay so i kind of understand what you
 

261
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,350
okay so i kind of understand what you
mean look this enough listen now

262
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
mean look this enough listen now
 

263
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,430
mean look this enough listen now
the light is look listen now this is

264
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
the light is look listen now this is
 

265
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,390
the light is look listen now this is
most heaviest

266
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
most heaviest
 

267
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,710
most heaviest
if the lightest can go with the most

268
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
if the lightest can go with the most
 

269
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,510
if the lightest can go with the most
heaviest

270
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
heaviest
 

271
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,990
heaviest
that these lightest can go with any

272
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
that these lightest can go with any
 

273
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,590
that these lightest can go with any
other shape any other way

274
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
other shape any other way
 

275
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,749
other shape any other way
right right because any other way is

276
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
right right because any other way is
 

277
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,830
right right because any other way is
smaller than the most heavy i'm right

278
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
smaller than the most heavy i'm right
 

279
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,150
smaller than the most heavy i'm right
okay that's what i said okay if the

280
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
okay that's what i said okay if the
 

281
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,790
okay that's what i said okay if the
ladies cannot go

282
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
ladies cannot go
 

283
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,390
ladies cannot go
with the most heaviest what does it mean

284
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
with the most heaviest what does it mean
 

285
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,150
with the most heaviest what does it mean
it means it means we need to

286
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
it means it means we need to
 

287
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,710
it means it means we need to
check go with the lightest with the

288
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
check go with the lightest with the
 

289
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,270
check go with the lightest with the
second

290
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
second
 

291
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,390
second
biggest no no if this must have it

292
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
biggest no no if this must have it
 

293
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,070
biggest no no if this must have it
cannot go with the

294
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
cannot go with the
 

295
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,110
cannot go with the
lightest then what does it mean it tells

296
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
lightest then what does it mean it tells
 

297
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,590
lightest then what does it mean it tells
us that the most heaviest cannot go with

298
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
us that the most heaviest cannot go with
 

299
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,510
us that the most heaviest cannot go with
any other

300
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
any other
 

301
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,350
any other
weight right because even the lightest

302
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
weight right because even the lightest
 

303
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,350
weight right because even the lightest
cannot go

304
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
cannot go
 

305
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,749
cannot go
then all other all other weights are

306
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
then all other all other weights are
 

307
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,110
then all other all other weights are
bigger than the lightest

308
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
bigger than the lightest
 

309
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,309
bigger than the lightest
right oh yeah yeah yeah doesn't make

310
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
right oh yeah yeah yeah doesn't make
 

311
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:32,790
right oh yeah yeah yeah doesn't make
sense

312
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
sense
 

313
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,390
sense
so let's just make it go right yeah yeah

314
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
so let's just make it go right yeah yeah
 

315
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,749
so let's just make it go right yeah yeah
okay so what does so what's the strategy

316
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
okay so what does so what's the strategy
 

317
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,870
okay so what does so what's the strategy
here

318
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
here
 

319
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,390
here
what's the strategy here well if we saw

320
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
what's the strategy here well if we saw
 

321
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,230
what's the strategy here well if we saw
these numbers

322
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
these numbers
 

323
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,270
these numbers
that would be 100 180

324
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
that would be 100 180
 

325
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,830
that would be 100 180
200 250 300

326
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
200 250 300
 

327
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,550
200 250 300
okay if we saw this number does it what

328
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
okay if we saw this number does it what
 

329
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,830
okay if we saw this number does it what
did we

330
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
did we
 

331
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,950
did we
learn yesterday

332
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
learn yesterday
 

333
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,950
learn yesterday
remember that yesterday what did we

334
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
remember that yesterday what did we
 

335
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,350
remember that yesterday what did we
learn

336

learn
 

337
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,309
learn
oh two pointers can we apply it oh yeah

338
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
oh two pointers can we apply it oh yeah
 

339
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:10,870
oh two pointers can we apply it oh yeah
yeah

340
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
yeah
 

341
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,270
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's the same thing

342
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's the same thing
 

343
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,390
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's the same thing
we saw this

344
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
we saw this
 

345
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,189
we saw this
every time we check the most harvest

346
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
every time we check the most harvest
 

347
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,909
every time we check the most harvest
right

348
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
right
 

349
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,830
right
and we have the lightest right

350
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
and we have the lightest right
 

351
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,430
and we have the lightest right
we check if these two can fit into 400

352
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
we check if these two can fit into 400
 

353
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,390
we check if these two can fit into 400
the limit

354
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
the limit
 

355
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,430
the limit
then we go we move it here if it's

356
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
then we go we move it here if it's
 

357
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,710
then we go we move it here if it's
bigger than the

358
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
bigger than the
 

359
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,189
bigger than the
most likely that one no we just let it

360
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
most likely that one no we just let it
 

361
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,870
most likely that one no we just let it
go right

362
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
go right
 

363
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,790
go right
got it so so it's like that

364
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
got it so so it's like that
 

365
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,520
got it so so it's like that
saying it's gone and then

366
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:41,530
saying it's gone and then
 

367

yeah because that what that's pretty
 

371
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,710
yeah because that what that's pretty
that greedy strategy why is that i just

372
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
that greedy strategy why is that i just
 

373
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,070
that greedy strategy why is that i just
told you because the only

374
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
told you because the only
 

375
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,950
told you because the only
one rocket can only have two people

376
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
one rocket can only have two people
 

377
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,670
one rocket can only have two people
right

378
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
right
 

379
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,390
right
yeah remember if the most have it can go

380
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
yeah remember if the most have it can go
 

381
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,469
yeah remember if the most have it can go
with the lymon societies it can go with

382
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
with the lymon societies it can go with
 

383
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,909
with the lymon societies it can go with
any other right

384
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
any other right
 

385
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,350
any other right
no no if the most if if normal service

386
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
no no if the most if if normal service
 

387
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,189
no no if the most if if normal service
can go with the lightest yeah

388
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
can go with the lightest yeah
 

389
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,390
can go with the lightest yeah
this ladies can go with any other right

390
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
this ladies can go with any other right
 

391
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,230
this ladies can go with any other right
it's what must have it cannot go with

392
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
it's what must have it cannot go with
 

393
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,070
it's what must have it cannot go with
the lightest what does it mean

394
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
the lightest what does it mean
 

395
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,469
the lightest what does it mean
it can only go by itself right because

396
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
it can only go by itself right because
 

397
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,510
it can only go by itself right because
it's only the

398
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
it's only the
 

399
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,350
it's only the
even the most lightest cannot go with

400
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
even the most lightest cannot go with
 

401
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,790
even the most lightest cannot go with
the most service

402
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
the most service
 

403
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,110
the most service
like the most heaviest will just go by

404
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
like the most heaviest will just go by
 

405
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,350
like the most heaviest will just go by
itself right yeah

406
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
itself right yeah
 

407
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,150
itself right yeah

define rock it
 

419
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,389
define rock it
lock it and now we have this weight

420
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
lock it and now we have this weight
 

421
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,750
lock it and now we have this weight
weight and now we have this limit column

422
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
weight and now we have this limit column
 

423
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,269
weight and now we have this limit column
okay look let's say uh

424
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
okay look let's say uh
 

425
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,630
okay look let's say uh
count called column is equal to zero at

426
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
count called column is equal to zero at
 

427
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,829
count called column is equal to zero at
the beginning

428
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
the beginning
 

429
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,389
the beginning
and first of all we need to do what one

430
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
and first of all we need to do what one

wherever it
 

437
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,470
wherever it
is okay well what's the time template i

438
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
is okay well what's the time template i
 

439
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,070
is okay well what's the time template i
went again

440
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
went again
 

441
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,829
went again
oh i'm looking for this one hashtag

442
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
oh i'm looking for this one hashtag
 

443
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,949
oh i'm looking for this one hashtag
okay

444
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959

 

445
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,070

so now we have this left right

446
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
so now we have this left right
 

447
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,990
so now we have this left right
equals left equals what oh

448
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
equals left equals what oh
 

449
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,509
equals left equals what oh
zero right and and minus one no no

450
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
zero right and and minus one no no
 

451
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,190
zero right and and minus one no no
length length weight minus one yeah yeah

452
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200

 

453
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,990

okay so what what what's next what what

454
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
okay so what what what's next what what
 

455
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,269
okay so what what what's next what what
why are left

456
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
why are left
 

457
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,509
why are left
left and right what like left or

458
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
left and right what like left or
 

459
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,990
left and right what like left or
left what what left smaller

460
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
left what what left smaller
 

461
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,509
left what what left smaller
than my equal right because it can be

462
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
than my equal right because it can be
 

463
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,790
than my equal right because it can be
equal right

464
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800
equal right
 

465
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,069
equal right
okay now how how what

466
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
okay now how how what
 

467
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,509
okay now how how what
possibly then all of them

468
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
possibly then all of them
 

469
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,870
possibly then all of them
must be the same if

470
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
must be the same if
 

471
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,990
must be the same if
l and r is the same it means there's

472
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
l and r is the same it means there's
 

473
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,509
l and r is the same it means there's
only one

474
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
only one
 

475
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,350
only one
yeah it's possible yeah there's only one

476
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
yeah it's possible yeah there's only one
 

477
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,790
yeah it's possible yeah there's only one
right it means that

478
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
right it means that
 

479
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,310
right it means that
all of them are the same no no no

480
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
all of them are the same no no no
 

481
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,829
all of them are the same no no no
left here a few weights and left here

482
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
left here a few weights and left here
 

483
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,230
left here a few weights and left here
right here right left and right can

484
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
right here right left and right can
 

485
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,069
right here right left and right can
point to the same one it means only one

486
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
point to the same one it means only one
 

487
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,110
point to the same one it means only one
right yeah oh yeah

488
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
right yeah oh yeah
 

489
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,790
right yeah oh yeah
okay look if left and right left is more

490
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
okay look if left and right left is more
 

491
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,829
okay look if left and right left is more
right so let's say weight yeah current

492
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
right so let's say weight yeah current
 

493
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,949
right so let's say weight yeah current
where

494
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
where
 

495
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,550
where
equals r that means you just go by

496
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
equals r that means you just go by
 

497
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,350
equals r that means you just go by
yourself

498

left right yeah
 

525
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,990
left right yeah
so it can only be right let's let's say

526
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
so it can only be right let's let's say
 

527
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,430
so it can only be right let's let's say
we pick on the right because the most

528
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
we pick on the right because the most
 

529
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,350
we pick on the right because the most
heaviest we go anyway right

530
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
heaviest we go anyway right
 

531
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,389
heaviest we go anyway right
yeah yeah the most heavies

532
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
yeah yeah the most heavies
 

533
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,389
yeah yeah the most heavies
will go anyway right and then ah

534
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
will go anyway right and then ah
 

535
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,150
will go anyway right and then ah
what ah what

536
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
what ah what
 

537
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,230
what ah what
when we pick the r what should we do

538
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
when we pick the r what should we do
 

539
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,230
when we pick the r what should we do
we add one i is on the right

540
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
we add one i is on the right
 

541
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,949
we add one i is on the right
uh minus one minus equal one okay and

542
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
uh minus one minus equal one okay and
 

543
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,590
uh minus one minus equal one okay and
then now

544
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
then now
 

545
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,670
then now
look if weight plus

546
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
look if weight plus
 

547
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,670
look if weight plus
what smaller or equal limit

548
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
what smaller or equal limit
 

549
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,069
what smaller or equal limit
can you tell me what well if the the

550
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
can you tell me what well if the the
 

551
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:08,710
can you tell me what well if the the
right

552
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
right
 

553
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,590
right
the most heaviest plus the most one

554
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
the most heaviest plus the most one
 

555
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,310
the most heaviest plus the most one
lightest

556
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
lightest
 

557
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,110
lightest
what's the most common air what's that

558
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
what's the most common air what's that
 

559
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,069
what's the most common air what's that
way to light

560
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079
way to light
 

561
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,190
way to light
weight air right yeah if black then what

562
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
weight air right yeah if black then what
 

563
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,790
weight air right yeah if black then what
should we do

564
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800

 

565
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,150

okay there we go and how can we

566
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
okay there we go and how can we
 

567
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,550
okay there we go and how can we
mean you will go how do we mean if we

568
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
mean you will go how do we mean if we
 

569
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,670
mean you will go how do we mean if we
will go

570
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
will go
 

571
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,269
will go
how do we mean if we go the left pointer

572
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
how do we mean if we go the left pointer
 

573
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,470
how do we mean if we go the left pointer
oh left and right left minus

574
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
oh left and right left minus
 

575
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,230
oh left and right left minus
left left add one and right minus

576
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
left left add one and right minus
 

577
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,990
left left add one and right minus
no we don't need to write already here

578
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
no we don't need to write already here

and then here when one goes so what do
 

583
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,829
and then here when one goes so what do
we do with the count

584
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
we do with the count
 

585
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,269
we do with the count
it turns at one yeah

586
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
it turns at one yeah
 

587
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,629
it turns at one yeah
okay and then return return

return answer right yeah yeah
you got it what's your time complexity

604
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
you got it what's your time complexity
 

605
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,509
you got it what's your time complexity
yeah there is

606
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
yeah there is
 

607
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,629
yeah there is
what's the time capacity what's the time

608
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
what's the time capacity what's the time
 

609
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,550
what's the time capacity what's the time
to brexit what's time conversely on this

610
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
to brexit what's time conversely on this
 

611
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,590
to brexit what's time conversely on this
path

612
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
path
 

613
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,829
path
this is our end again and this part is

614
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839
this is our end again and this part is
 

615
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,949
this is our end again and this part is
what i went

616
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
what i went
 

617
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,550
what i went
oh and so what's going on why is that i

618
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
oh and so what's going on why is that i
 

619
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,829

wow yeah with this okay even
this is has a space yeah does it make

650
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
this is has a space yeah does it make
 

651
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:22,790
this is has a space yeah does it make
sense yeah

652
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
sense yeah
 

653
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,389

right look
 

655
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,269
right look
if we we haven't used we haven't put all

656
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
if we we haven't used we haven't put all
 

657
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:29,990
if we we haven't used we haven't put all
the weight

658
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
the weight
 

659
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,189
the weight
in the in the spaceship right then we

660
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
in the in the spaceship right then we
 

661
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,470
in the in the spaceship right then we
pick the most heaviest

662
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
pick the most heaviest
 

663
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,949
pick the most heaviest
all right all right we pick the most

664
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
all right all right we pick the most
 

665
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,150
all right all right we pick the most
heaviest

666
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
heaviest
 

667
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,269
heaviest
ah minus equals one if the

668
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
ah minus equals one if the
 

669
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,389
ah minus equals one if the
common weight plus the most likely

670
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
common weight plus the most likely
 

671
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,829
common weight plus the most likely
can go with in the current ship

672
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
can go with in the current ship
 

673
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,030
can go with in the current ship
then we take that right

674
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
then we take that right
 

675
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,030
then we take that right
we take that let's believe that but

676
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
we take that let's believe that but
 

677
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,230
we take that let's believe that but
anyway

678
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
anyway
 

679
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,269
anyway
but anyway we will we go we have every

680
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
but anyway we will we go we have every
 

681
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,829
but anyway we will we go we have every
every iteration means that we let a

682
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
every iteration means that we let a
 

683
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,829
every iteration means that we let a
spaceship go am right

684
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
spaceship go am right
 

685
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,750
spaceship go am right
yes okay

686
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760

 

687
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,870

that's it for today bye

688
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
that's it for today bye
 

689
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,199
