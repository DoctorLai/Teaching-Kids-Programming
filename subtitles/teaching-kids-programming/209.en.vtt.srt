1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,150

okay so remember we talked about the

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
okay so remember we talked about the
 

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,549
okay so remember we talked about the
parentheses what's parentheses

4
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
parentheses what's parentheses
 

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,270
parentheses what's parentheses
uh it's just like a bracket bracket okay

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,280
uh it's just like a bracket bracket okay
 

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,950
uh it's just like a bracket bracket okay
bracket print this is

8
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
bracket print this is
 

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,870
bracket print this is
open bracket open parenthesis closing

10
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
open bracket open parenthesis closing
 

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,070
open bracket open parenthesis closing
practices

12
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
practices
 

13
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,070
practices
so so

14
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
so so
 

15
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,230
so so
if do we still remember how do we check

16
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
if do we still remember how do we check
 

17
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,269
if do we still remember how do we check
if a string

18
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
if a string
 

19
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,109
if a string
if a string contains only these two

20
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
if a string contains only these two
 

21
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,189
if a string contains only these two
parentheses how do we check if it match

22
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:29,199
parentheses how do we check if it match
 

23
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,390
parentheses how do we check if it match
if it's a valid

24
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
if it's a valid
 

25
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,709
if it's a valid
well what i mean values it comes with

26
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
well what i mean values it comes with
 

27
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,830
well what i mean values it comes with
pairs

28
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
pairs
 

29
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,030
pairs
and this is a very penises

30
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
and this is a very penises
 

31
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,310
and this is a very penises
this is a variable this is not

32
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
this is a variable this is not
 

33
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,150
this is a variable this is not
this is not right

34
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
this is not right
 

35
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,189
this is not right
this is uh um

36
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
this is uh um
 

37
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,029
this is uh um
these this is not

38
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
these this is not
 

39
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,709
these this is not
right okay okay you just need to find

40
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
right okay okay you just need to find
 

41
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,389
right okay okay you just need to find
out i think you're just doing like a

42
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
out i think you're just doing like a
 

43
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,389
out i think you're just doing like a
matching petal

44
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
matching petal
 

45
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,229
matching petal
yeah how do we find if we are given a

46
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
yeah how do we find if we are given a
 

47
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,870
yeah how do we find if we are given a
string how do we know if it's a very

48
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
string how do we know if it's a very
 

49
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,230
string how do we know if it's a very
print decision

50
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
print decision
 

51
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,590
print decision
uh we just like doing the id and

52
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600

 

53
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,190

specifically so how do we check if the

54
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
specifically so how do we check if the
 

55
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,550
specifically so how do we check if the
it's a very kind of seasonal for example

56
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
it's a very kind of seasonal for example
 

57
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,980
it's a very kind of seasonal for example
yeah i'm gonna do one

58
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:27,990

 

59
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:39,590

[Music]

60
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600

 

61
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,109

and then so we start from zero

62
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
and then so we start from zero
 

63
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,149
and then so we start from zero
okay so we have a counter if we have

64
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
okay so we have a counter if we have
 

65
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,590
okay so we have a counter if we have
one like this yeah open parenthesis add

66
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
one like this yeah open parenthesis add
 

67
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,190
one like this yeah open parenthesis add
one and if we have one like this

68
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
one and if we have one like this
 

69
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,789
one and if we have one like this
and equals minus one okay so we have a

70
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
and equals minus one okay so we have a
 

71
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,350
and equals minus one okay so we have a
counter when we meet the opening bracket

72
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
counter when we meet the opening bracket
 

73
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,789
counter when we meet the opening bracket
we increment the counter by one right

74
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
we increment the counter by one right
 

75
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,709
we increment the counter by one right
when we meet the closing bracket we

76
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
when we meet the closing bracket we
 

77
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,830
when we meet the closing bracket we
decrement by one

78
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
decrement by one
 

79
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,790
decrement by one
right and then what happened if if the

80
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
right and then what happened if if the
 

81
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,469
right and then what happened if if the
counter fall below zero what does it

82
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
counter fall below zero what does it
 

83
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:10,949
counter fall below zero what does it
mean

84
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
mean
 

85
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,110
mean
it's not it's not a very parenthesis and

86
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
it's not it's not a very parenthesis and
 

87
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,589
it's not it's not a very parenthesis and
at the end if the balance if the counter

88
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
at the end if the balance if the counter
 

89
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,229
at the end if the balance if the counter
is not zero what happened what does it

90
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
is not zero what happened what does it
 

91
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,309
is not zero what happened what does it
mean

92
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
mean
 

93
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,309
mean
it's not right for example like that

94
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
it's not right for example like that
 

95
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,350
it's not right for example like that
yeah what's the balance of the piece

96
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
yeah what's the balance of the piece
 

97
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,869
yeah what's the balance of the piece
minus one one yeah

98
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
minus one one yeah
 

99
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,390
minus one one yeah
what's the what uh what's the

100
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
what's the what uh what's the
 

101
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,509
what's the what uh what's the
balance minus two minus two one

102
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
balance minus two minus two one
 

103
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,589
balance minus two minus two one
here minus one we immediately know it's

104
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
here minus one we immediately know it's
 

105
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,430
here minus one we immediately know it's
not very very positive right

106
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
not very very positive right
 

107
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,270
not very very positive right
okay let's go use that what's the time

108
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
okay let's go use that what's the time
 

109
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,910
okay let's go use that what's the time
complexity of this one

110
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
complexity of this one
 

111
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,030
complexity of this one
oh oh oh

112
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
oh oh oh
 

113
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,070
oh oh oh
n okay

114
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
n okay
 

115
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,270
n okay
okay so today's task is something

116
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
okay so today's task is something
 

117
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,670
okay so today's task is something
similar so given the integer and we want

118
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
similar so given the integer and we want
 

119
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,150
similar so given the integer and we want
to

120
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
to
 

121
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,430
to
find out that uh how many ways we can

122
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
find out that uh how many ways we can
 

123
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,670
find out that uh how many ways we can
generate a variable contains

124
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
generate a variable contains
 

125
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,470
generate a variable contains
n pairs remember it's n pairs so what

126
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
n pairs remember it's n pairs so what
 

127
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,110
n pairs remember it's n pairs so what
does it mean

128
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
does it mean
 

129
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,630
does it mean
a pair and one n equals one a pair

130
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
a pair and one n equals one a pair
 

131
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,949
a pair and one n equals one a pair
is this this is the very parenthesis

132
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
is this this is the very parenthesis
 

133
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,750
is this this is the very parenthesis
right

134
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
right
 

135
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,070
right
so given m pairs what does it mean

136
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
so given m pairs what does it mean
 

137
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,830
so given m pairs what does it mean
what's the length of the string

138
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
what's the length of the string
 

139
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,869
what's the length of the string
in the n times two n times two yeah

140
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
in the n times two n times two yeah
 

141
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,270
in the n times two n times two yeah
because

142
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
because
 

143
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,670
because
each pair contains two they are n pairs

144
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
each pair contains two they are n pairs
 

145
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,110
each pair contains two they are n pairs
the total length is

146
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
the total length is
 

147
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,550
the total length is
n times n times two okay

148
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
n times n times two okay
 

149
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,589
n times n times two okay
okay so for example n equals one

150
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
okay so for example n equals one
 

151
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:36,229
okay so for example n equals one
easy right when n equals 2

152
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239

 

153
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,110

can you write the answer to n equals to

154
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
can you write the answer to n equals to
 

155
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,670
can you write the answer to n equals to
2 pairs how many possibilities of the

156
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
2 pairs how many possibilities of the
 

157
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,509
2 pairs how many possibilities of the
two pairs

158
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519

 

159
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,949

any other options

160
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
any other options
 

161
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,309
any other options
mean i think so um yeah i think you're

162
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
mean i think so um yeah i think you're
 

163
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,869
mean i think so um yeah i think you're
right yes that's only

164
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
right yes that's only
 

165
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,429
right yes that's only
good uh players yeah and players of

166
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
good uh players yeah and players of
 

167
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,030
good uh players yeah and players of
valley princesses

168
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
valley princesses
 

169
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,589

every possibility right so how many n
 

191
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,110
every possibility right so how many n
equals two so n pairs we know is n times

192
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
equals two so n pairs we know is n times
 

193
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,830

243
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,310
parentheses yeah yeah
each one is two two possibilities so if

244
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
each one is two two possibilities so if
 

245
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,790
each one is two two possibilities so if
they are n times two slots

246
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
they are n times two slots
 

247
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,830
they are n times two slots
what's the how many possibilities of all

248
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
what's the how many possibilities of all
 

249
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,350
what's the how many possibilities of all
these uh

250
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
these uh
 

251
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,189
these uh
the string if if there are n times two

252
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
the string if if there are n times two
 

253
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,670
the string if if there are n times two
slots

slots
 

255
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,950
slots
and each slot contains two possibilities

256
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
and each slot contains two possibilities
 

257
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,070
and each slot contains two possibilities
so what's the overall

258
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
so what's the overall
 

259
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,310
so what's the overall
and well

two four one what's next come on eight
 

279
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,590
two four one what's next come on eight
eight yes and so

280
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
eight yes and so
 

281
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,629
eight yes and so
of two of t two to the power of two

282
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
of two of t two to the power of two
 

283
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,029
of two of t two to the power of two
times

284
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
times
 

285
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,029
times
n yeah that's the length yeah definitely

286
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
n yeah that's the length yeah definitely
 

287
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,629
n yeah that's the length yeah definitely
kind of bigger

288
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
kind of bigger
 

289
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,749
kind of bigger
yeah and remember we take enemies n

290
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
yeah and remember we take enemies n
 

291
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,469
yeah and remember we take enemies n
o n time all right to check if it's the

292
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
o n time all right to check if it's the
 

293
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,990
o n time all right to check if it's the
uh a string is the very

294
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
uh a string is the very
 

295
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,950
uh a string is the very
parenthesis right yeah it's i know we

296
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
parenthesis right yeah it's i know we
 

297
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,710
parenthesis right yeah it's i know we
need to times what

298
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
need to times what
 

299
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,870
need to times what
two times n because the length is two

300
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
two times n because the length is two
 

301
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,990
two times n because the length is two
times n

302
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
times n
 

303
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,950
times n
right so but we can drop the constant

304
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
right so but we can drop the constant
 

305
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,270
right so but we can drop the constant
right

306
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
right
 

307
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,990
right
look we can drop this constant so o the

308
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
look we can drop this constant so o the
 

309
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,749
look we can drop this constant so o the
overall complexity is o

310
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
overall complexity is o
 

311
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,390
overall complexity is o
n times two to the power of two times n

312
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
n times two to the power of two times n
 

313
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,189
n times two to the power of two times n
right

314
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
right
 

315
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,830
right
okay that's a lot yeah yes that's a lot

316
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840
okay that's a lot yeah yes that's a lot
 

317
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,990
okay that's a lot yeah yes that's a lot
right

318
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
right
 

319
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,189
right
okay so so what's the problem of this

320
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
okay so so what's the problem of this
 

321
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,230
okay so so what's the problem of this
one

322
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
one
 

323
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,309
one
it is two why is this low because

324
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
it is two why is this low because
 

325
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,790
it is two why is this low because
we know the beginning the beginning

326
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
we know the beginning the beginning
 

327
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,589
we know the beginning the beginning
can it be a closing bracket

328
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599

 

329
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,469

if it if it's if it's start with a

330
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
if it if it's if it's start with a
 

331
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,309
if it if it's if it's start with a
closing bracket

332
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
closing bracket
 

333
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,070
closing bracket
it's definitely not that's the problem

334
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
it's definitely not that's the problem
 

335
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,710
it's definitely not that's the problem
yeah so we know in some cases we already

336
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
yeah so we know in some cases we already
 

337
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,350
yeah so we know in some cases we already
know that no matter

338
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
know that no matter
 

339
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,749
know that no matter
what kind of the possibilities come

340
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
what kind of the possibilities come
 

341
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,790
what kind of the possibilities come
afterwards

342
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
afterwards
 

343
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,909
afterwards
it's still uh invalid

344
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
it's still uh invalid
 

345
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,350
it's still uh invalid
parentheses right yeah so there's no way

346
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
parentheses right yeah so there's no way
 

347
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,670
parentheses right yeah so there's no way
look how many possibilities are these

348
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
look how many possibilities are these
 

349
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,950
look how many possibilities are these
there are a lot right

350
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
there are a lot right
 

351
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,830
there are a lot right
but once we have we know it's a closing

352
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
but once we have we know it's a closing
 

353
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,670
but once we have we know it's a closing
parenthesis do we need to generate all

354
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
parenthesis do we need to generate all
 

355
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,070
parenthesis do we need to generate all
of those and check again again no right

356
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
of those and check again again no right
 

357
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,749
of those and check again again no right
so we are because we are wasting time

358
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
so we are because we are wasting time
 

359
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,589
so we are because we are wasting time
here let's put for thing right

360
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
here let's put for thing right
 

361
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,950
here let's put for thing right
so we can use the backtracking which is

362
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
so we can use the backtracking which is
 

363
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,629
so we can use the backtracking which is
the default search

364
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
the default search
 

365
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,350
the default search
definite search and then we don't

366
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
definite search and then we don't
 

367
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,070
definite search and then we don't
continue

368
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
continue
 

369
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,110
continue
exploring the path if

370
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
exploring the path if
 

371
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,550
exploring the path if
we found out that the current

372
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
we found out that the current
 

373
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,309
we found out that the current
current settings do not lead to a valid

374
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
current settings do not lead to a valid
 

375
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,510
current settings do not lead to a valid
configurations right

376
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
configurations right
 

377
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,469
configurations right
do not need uh configure to current

378
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
do not need uh configure to current
 

379
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,390
do not need uh configure to current
configuration do not need

380
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
configuration do not need
 

381
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,749
configuration do not need
to not lead to valid solutions

382
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
to not lead to valid solutions
 

383
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,909
to not lead to valid solutions
right now we don't spend time doing that

384
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
right now we don't spend time doing that
 

385
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,909
right now we don't spend time doing that
now we're just backtracking yeah

386
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
now we're just backtracking yeah
 

387
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,830
now we're just backtracking yeah
backtracking what's backtracking

388
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
backtracking what's backtracking
 

389
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,829
backtracking what's backtracking
backtracking um backtracking

390
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839

 

391
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,469

yeah so in order to do this

392
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
yeah so in order to do this
 

393
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,269
yeah so in order to do this
we can define the function yeah okay

394
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
we can define the function yeah okay
 

395
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,949
we can define the function yeah okay
let's do this define

396
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959

 

397
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,070

define what let's say uh let's

398
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
define what let's say uh let's
 

399
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,829
define what let's say uh let's
let's call it therefore search right

400
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
let's call it therefore search right
 

401
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,110
let's call it therefore search right
search okay then we obviously outside we

402
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
search okay then we obviously outside we
 

403
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,310
search okay then we obviously outside we
have this answer

404
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
have this answer
 

405
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,750
have this answer
we answer equals the bracket thing

406
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
we answer equals the bracket thing
 

407
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,870
we answer equals the bracket thing
the list of empty solutions and now we

408
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
the list of empty solutions and now we
 

409
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,509
the list of empty solutions and now we
need to

410
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
need to
 

411
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,949
need to
remember we need to remember the current

412
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
remember we need to remember the current
 

413
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,910
remember we need to remember the current
the current solution the current color

414
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
the current solution the current color
 

415
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,990
the current solution the current color
string current

416
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
string current
 

417
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,110
string current
current part of the valid parenthesis

418
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
current part of the valid parenthesis
 

419
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,949
current part of the valid parenthesis
string so we call it current right and

420
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
string so we call it current right and
 

421
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,509
string so we call it current right and
then

422
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
then
 

423
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,910
then
open the current number of opening

424
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
open the current number of opening
 

425
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,630
open the current number of opening
processes

426
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
processes
 

427
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,269
processes
and then closing parentheses yes closing

428
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
and then closing parentheses yes closing
 

429
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,470
and then closing parentheses yes closing
okay okay so look

430
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
okay okay so look
 

431
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,470
okay okay so look
so at the beginning

432
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
so at the beginning
 

433
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,829
so at the beginning
and at the beginning we want to call

434
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:37,839
and at the beginning we want to call
 

435
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,230
and at the beginning we want to call
this function with empty

436
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
this function with empty
 

437
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,910
this function with empty
yeah because currently we uh at the

438
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
yeah because currently we uh at the
 

439
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,509
yeah because currently we uh at the
beginning we don't

440
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
beginning we don't
 

441
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,070
beginning we don't
know we don't generate any parenthesis

442
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
know we don't generate any parenthesis
 

443
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,590
know we don't generate any parenthesis
at all right

444
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
at all right
 

445
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,269
at all right
and now we shall pass with the second

446
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
and now we shall pass with the second
 

447
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,230
and now we shall pass with the second
parameter answer parameters

448
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240

 

449
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,710

and closing what's the what's the number

450
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
and closing what's the what's the number
 

451
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,750
and closing what's the what's the number
of the opening and closing

452
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
of the opening and closing
 

453
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,230
of the opening and closing
opening at the beginning do we have any

454
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
opening at the beginning do we have any
 

455
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,990
opening at the beginning do we have any
no so what's the number what you put

456
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
no so what's the number what you put
 

457
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,910
no so what's the number what you put
here is it right yes yellow opening and

458
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
here is it right yes yellow opening and
 

459
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,430
here is it right yes yellow opening and
zero closing okay

460
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
zero closing okay
 

461
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,110
zero closing okay
okay now if the length of current

462
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
okay now if the length of current
 

463
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,069
okay now if the length of current
okay if this string yeah alright look at

464
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
okay if this string yeah alright look at
 

465
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:27,590
okay if this string yeah alright look at
me

466
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600

 

467
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,910

no the length if the current length is

468
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
no the length if the current length is
 

469
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,269
no the length if the current length is
equals n times

470
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
equals n times
 

471
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,550
equals n times
n plus n what does it mean

472
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:33,560
n plus n what does it mean
 

473
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,949
n plus n what does it mean
[Music]

474
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
[Music]
 

475
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,509
[Music]
is that technically yeah n times two

476
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
is that technically yeah n times two
 

477
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:37,990
is that technically yeah n times two
then

478
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
then
 

479
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,030
then
this is the value parenthesis right yeah

480
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
this is the value parenthesis right yeah
 

481
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,870
this is the value parenthesis right yeah
then we can answer a pen a pen

482
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
then we can answer a pen a pen
 

483
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,269
then we can answer a pen a pen
current right yeah does it make sense

484
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
current right yeah does it make sense
 

485
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,910
current right yeah does it make sense
the default search if we if if we

486
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
the default search if we if if we
 

487
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,630
the default search if we if if we
already

488
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,640
already
 

489
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,069
already
know uh

490
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
know uh
 

491
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,750
know uh
actually actually there is something

492
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
actually actually there is something
 

493
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,310
actually actually there is something
here if

494
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
here if
 

495
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,430
here if
if the current string has to

496
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
if the current string has to
 

497
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,190
if the current string has to
has has the length of left

498
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
has has the length of left
 

499
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,110
has has the length of left
to n we still need to check

500
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
to n we still need to check
 

501
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,550
to n we still need to check
if what then we can append it

502
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
if what then we can append it
 

503
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,230
if what then we can append it
answer the append

504
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240

 

505
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,509

current can you tell me what it is is

506
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
current can you tell me what it is is
 

507
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,750
current can you tell me what it is is
what

508
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
what
 

509
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,350
what
between closing opening and closing

510
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
between closing opening and closing
 

511
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,509
between closing opening and closing
one opening work closing

512
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
one opening work closing
 

513
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,710
one opening work closing
for a very princesses opening

514
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
for a very princesses opening
 

515
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,590
for a very princesses opening
opening and closing what are the smaller

516
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
opening and closing what are the smaller
 

517
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:39,990
opening and closing what are the smaller
what

518
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
what
 

519
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,230
what
for a very apprenticeship i'm saying for

520
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
for a very apprenticeship i'm saying for
 

521
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,710
for a very apprenticeship i'm saying for
ready parentheses what's the relation

522
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
ready parentheses what's the relation
 

523
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,389
ready parentheses what's the relation
number of the parentheses yeah equal

524
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
number of the parentheses yeah equal
 

525
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,509
number of the parentheses yeah equal
right yeah if the length

526
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
right yeah if the length
 

527
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,030
right yeah if the length
is is the final length right

528
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
is is the final length right
 

529
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,069
is is the final length right
yeah if we want to generate three three

530
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
yeah if we want to generate three three
 

531
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,550
yeah if we want to generate three three
pairs

532
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
pairs
 

533
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,110
pairs
three pairs of very premises and the

534
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
three pairs of very premises and the
 

535
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,670
three pairs of very premises and the
length

536
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
length
 

537
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,910
length
is six right that's what it means the

538
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
is six right that's what it means the
 

539
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,269
is six right that's what it means the
length is six

540
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
length is six
 

541
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,470
length is six
now we need to check if they are three

542
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
now we need to check if they are three
 

543
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,910
now we need to check if they are three
yeah if it's there three opening or

544
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
yeah if it's there three opening or
 

545
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,750
yeah if it's there three opening or
three closing right and three closing

546
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
three closing right and three closing
 

547
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,389
three closing right and three closing
another way of doing this is if opening

548
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:16,399
another way of doing this is if opening
 

549
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:16,949
another way of doing this is if opening
equals

550
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
equals
 

551
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,269
equals
n n and what

552
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
n n and what
 

553
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:30,389
n n and what
and what closing equal as well

554
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399

 

555
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,190

if opening equals ends closing equals

556
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
if opening equals ends closing equals
 

557
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,710
if opening equals ends closing equals
one come on opening

558
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
one come on opening
 

559
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,230
one come on opening
sorry opening equals closing another way

560
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
sorry opening equals closing another way
 

561
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,350
sorry opening equals closing another way
of writing this is if opening equals m

562
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
of writing this is if opening equals m
 

563
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,790
of writing this is if opening equals m
and currency equals one

564
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
and currency equals one
 

565
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,150
and currency equals one
come on opening n

566
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
come on opening n
 

567
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,990
come on opening n
n come on open the equal sign and

568
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
n come on open the equal sign and
 

569
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,670
n come on open the equal sign and
closing percent right

570
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
closing percent right
 

571
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,350
closing percent right
it's the same thing as opening equals

572
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
it's the same thing as opening equals
 

573
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,949
it's the same thing as opening equals
closing because the

574
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
closing because the
 

575
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,389
closing because the
length is n plus n right right corner

576
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
length is n plus n right right corner
 

577
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,310
length is n plus n right right corner

581
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,629

583
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,350

the opening is what is smaller or equal
 

661
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,550
the opening is what is smaller or equal
than closing them right does it make

662
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
than closing them right does it make
 

663
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,069
than closing them right does it make
sense

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,629
sure yeah in any cases i can always
start with the opening there's only one

678
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
start with the opening there's only one
 

679
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,069
start with the opening there's only one
condition i cannot start with the

680
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
condition i cannot start with the
 

681
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,350
condition i cannot start with the
opening why is that

682
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
opening why is that
 

683
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,069
opening why is that
how many max how many what's the maximum

684
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
how many max how many what's the maximum
 

685
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,829
how many max how many what's the maximum
number of opening can we

686
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
number of opening can we
 

687
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,790
number of opening can we
can we generate in this particular case

688
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
can we generate in this particular case
 

689
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,230
can we generate in this particular case
all of them

690
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240

 

691
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,670

what what's the maximum

692
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
what what's the maximum
 

693
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,189
what what's the maximum
the number no n yeah yeah

694
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
the number no n yeah yeah
 

695
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,389
the number no n yeah yeah
okay so if opening one

696
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
okay so if opening one
 

697
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,509
okay so if opening one
if opening is a smaller end

698
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
if opening is a smaller end
 

699
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,350
if opening is a smaller end
yeah if opening is smaller than

700
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
yeah if opening is smaller than
 

701
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,949
yeah if opening is smaller than
obviously i can do this right it's

702
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
obviously i can do this right it's
 

703
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,710
obviously i can do this right it's
nothing to do with the closing right

704
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
nothing to do with the closing right
 

705
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,550
nothing to do with the closing right
because at any point i can start with

706
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
because at any point i can start with
 

707
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,069
because at any point i can start with
the opening all right

708
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
the opening all right
 

709
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,030
the opening all right
yes can you find an example that i

710
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
yes can you find an example that i
 

711
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,509
yes can you find an example that i
cannot start with the opening

712
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519

 

713
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,629

yeah right now all right are you all

714
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
yeah right now all right are you all
 

715
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,110
yeah right now all right are you all
right

716
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120

 

717
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,069

okay for this closing how can we do this

718
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
okay for this closing how can we do this
 

719
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:20,790
okay for this closing how can we do this
closing

720
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
closing
 

721
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,670
closing
i mean if the opening

722
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680

 

723
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,030

what

724
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040

 

725
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,470

i think what it's not closing

726
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
i think what it's not closing
 

727
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,550
i think what it's not closing
yeah so in what cases we can start with

728
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
yeah so in what cases we can start with
 

729
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,629
yeah so in what cases we can start with
the closing er

730
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639

 

731
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,230

if if open and close

732
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
if if open and close
 

733
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,749
if if open and close
what condition is open

734
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:45,759
what condition is open
 

735
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,749
what condition is open
bigger yes y is bigger if open is bigger

736
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
bigger yes y is bigger if open is bigger
 

737
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:49,990
bigger yes y is bigger if open is bigger
than

738
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
than
 

739
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,069
than
closing then we can do the closing here

740
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
closing then we can do the closing here
 

741
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,790
closing then we can do the closing here
yeah look if there are two open

742
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
yeah look if there are two open
 

743
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,269
yeah look if there are two open
and one closing i can start with the

744
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
and one closing i can start with the
 

745
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,389
and one closing i can start with the
closing yeah

746
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
closing yeah
 

747
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,350
closing yeah
all right yes yeah oh

748
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
all right yes yeah oh
 

749
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,230
all right yes yeah oh
if if they look if open is close equal

750
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
if if they look if open is close equal
 

751
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,029
if if they look if open is close equal
to the club

752
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
to the club
 

753
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,630
to the club
then i cannot start with the club right

754
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
then i cannot start with the club right
 

755
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,309
then i cannot start with the club right
because as long as i start with the

756
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
because as long as i start with the
 

757
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:10,949
because as long as i start with the
clothes but

758
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
clothes but
 

759
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,350
clothes but
the balance will fall below yellow

760
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
the balance will fall below yellow
 

761
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,429
the balance will fall below yellow
you'll be negative so you ready right

762
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
you'll be negative so you ready right
 

763
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,189
you'll be negative so you ready right
correct yeah okay so in this case we can

764
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
correct yeah okay so in this case we can
 

765
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,029
correct yeah okay so in this case we can
just do this

766
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,039
just do this
 

767
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,990
just do this
so it will be a lot faster than the

768
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,000
so it will be a lot faster than the
 

769
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,270
so it will be a lot faster than the
proof of thing yeah

770
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
proof of thing yeah
 

771
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,029
proof of thing yeah
the time complexity for this one is a

772
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
the time complexity for this one is a
 

773
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,190
the time complexity for this one is a
bit tricky okay you don't need to

774
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
bit tricky okay you don't need to
 

775
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,470
bit tricky okay you don't need to
it's out of scope right it's huge is

776
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
it's out of scope right it's huge is
 

777
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,029
it's out of scope right it's huge is
uh yeah it's very complex it's

778
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
uh yeah it's very complex it's
 

779
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,669
uh yeah it's very complex it's
4 to the power n divided by square n

780
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
4 to the power n divided by square n
 

781
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,029
4 to the power n divided by square n
yeah it's quite complicated it's

782
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
yeah it's quite complicated it's
 

783
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,909
yeah it's quite complicated it's
mathematic

784
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
mathematic
 

785
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,789
mathematic
is the it's roughly the

786
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
is the it's roughly the
 

787
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,789
is the it's roughly the
the catalan number c2n

788
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799

 

789
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,549

yeah so it's quite from there i can talk

790
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
yeah so it's quite from there i can talk
 

791
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,029
yeah so it's quite from there i can talk
about this the other day okay

792
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
about this the other day okay
 

793
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,310
about this the other day okay
but this is far better than far better

794
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,320
but this is far better than far better
 

795
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,710
but this is far better than far better
than

796
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
than
 

797
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,789
than
than than what then what's the beginning

798
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
than than what then what's the beginning
 

799
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,750
than than what then what's the beginning
to the power of two n times n right yeah

800
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
to the power of two n times n right yeah
 

801
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,070
to the power of two n times n right yeah
this

802
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
this
 

803
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,390
this
is far better than this one okay because

804
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
is far better than this one okay because
 

805
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,590
is far better than this one okay because
this one

806
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600

 

807
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,669

yeah times is exponential look this is

808
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
yeah times is exponential look this is
 

809
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,350
yeah times is exponential look this is
exponential yeah

810
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
exponential yeah
 

811
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,150
exponential yeah
yeah why this is better can you can you

812
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
yeah why this is better can you can you
 

813
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,630
yeah why this is better can you can you
explain

814
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
explain
 

815
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,789
explain
daddy like why this is better because

816
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
daddy like why this is better because
 

817
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,909
daddy like why this is better because
the time

818
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
the time
 

819
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,870
the time
complexity yeah and why this has a

820
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
complexity yeah and why this has a
 

821
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,390
complexity yeah and why this has a
better time complexity

822
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
better time complexity
 

823
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,630
better time complexity
i will have faster time contexting

824
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
i will have faster time contexting
 

825
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,909
i will have faster time contexting
because

826
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
because
 

827
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,310
because
because if it begins with a

828
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,320
because if it begins with a
 

829
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,669
because if it begins with a
closing bracket it you know immediately

830
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
closing bracket it you know immediately
 

831
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,390
closing bracket it you know immediately
if it's not valid then we don't need to

832
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
if it's not valid then we don't need to
 

833
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,350
if it's not valid then we don't need to
try right

834
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
try right
 

835
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,430
try right
so for this one is that we don't

836
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
so for this one is that we don't
 

837
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,350
so for this one is that we don't
generate all possibilities but for the

838
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,360
generate all possibilities but for the
 

839
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,549
generate all possibilities but for the
first approach a proof of thing

840
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:50,559
first approach a proof of thing
 

841
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,230
first approach a proof of thing
how how does it work we generate all

842
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
how how does it work we generate all
 

843
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,909
how how does it work we generate all

you can generate uh open parenthesis

890
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,360
you can generate uh open parenthesis
 

891
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,470
you can generate uh open parenthesis
you can generate a closing practices but

892
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480
you can generate a closing practices but
 

893
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,990
you can generate a closing practices but
here we don't need to do this right

894
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
here we don't need to do this right
 

895
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,390
here we don't need to do this right
because

896
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
because
 

897
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,549
because
basically these branches we don't need

898
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:50,559
basically these branches we don't need
 

899
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,990
basically these branches we don't need
to explore but here opening

900

to explore but here opening
 

901
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,710
to explore but here opening
bracket can we generate the opening okay

902
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
bracket can we generate the opening okay
 

903
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,430
bracket can we generate the opening okay
yes

904

can we generate a closing bracket yes
 

907
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,750
can we generate a closing bracket yes
and here do we can we generally open

908
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,760
and here do we can we generally open
 

909
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,430
and here do we can we generally open
bracket yes can we generate closing

no right right look at this this branch

914
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:07,039
no right right look at this this branch
 

915
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,590
no right right look at this this branch
this

916

this
 

917
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,110
this
literally subtree yeah we just don't

918
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
literally subtree yeah we just don't
 

919
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,830
literally subtree yeah we just don't
visit it

920
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
visit it
 

921
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,390
visit it
yeah we save time here right you see

922
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,400
yeah we save time here right you see
 

923
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,909
yeah we save time here right you see
let's

924
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
let's
 

925
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,149
let's
the therefore search proof was in

926
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:18,159
the therefore search proof was in
 

927
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,990
the therefore search proof was in
definition is try to visit

is what it's a definite search but i

934
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
is what it's a definite search but i
 

935
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,190
is what it's a definite search but i
don't

936
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200
don't
 

937
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,750
don't
visit those useless branch all right

938
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
visit those useless branch all right
 

939
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,549
visit those useless branch all right
let's go back

940
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
let's go back
 

941
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,630
let's go back
at uh backtracking okay all right

942
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
at uh backtracking okay all right
 

943
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,310
at uh backtracking okay all right
yeah yeah because i i just found out

944
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
yeah yeah because i i just found out
 

945
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,549
yeah yeah because i i just found out
it's usually visiting here and then why

946
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
it's usually visiting here and then why
 

947
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,870
it's usually visiting here and then why
should i keep visiting here right

948
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
should i keep visiting here right
 

949
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,830
should i keep visiting here right
i can just go to the very branches all

950
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:46,840
i can just go to the very branches all
 

951
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,390
i can just go to the very branches all
right

952
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
right
 

953
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,190
