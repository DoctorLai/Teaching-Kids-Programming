1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,440
go

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,520
hello mr mr ryan you're right yeah

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,480
what's binary string a boundary the

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,480
binary tweet i added

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,040
okay

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,880
it's kind of graph right the tree fluffy

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,520
okay so i'm going to draw the binary

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,039
tree here and then can you tell me what

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,560
is the longest part okay so can you tell

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,240
me

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,760
that

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,640
what's the longest path

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,360
which ones which one is the look which

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,040
one is the loop

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,480
which one is the rule this is the final

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,440
three it's three

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,480
three which one is the root zero

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,480
yeah that's the loop

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,120
these are these with no kids yeah leaves

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,520
yeah so if you look it upside down right

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,160
upside down this is the good yeah girl

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,079
the tree is going downwards okay

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,000
at least i have parents these are

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,439
parents there and also the children of

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,320
the

26
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,400
final trip because each each note has at

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,799
most two kids right

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,720
let's go to the tree okay

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,640
a binary tree is a graph right it's a

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,680
graph

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,640
and specifically is directed at cyclic

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,920
graph why is it directed because

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,400
usually usually you can only visit the

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,799
children from the parents so

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,640
basically there's an error here right

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,759
yeah it's an area here

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,079
it's one it's one connective connected

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,880
okay it's connected so it means a single

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,520
component is connected yeah it's

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,280
connected it's not like this this is not

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,920
a tree

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,479
what's this forest a forest and it's a

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,960
graph because look it's separate it's

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,200
not connected it's three trees a cyclist

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,439
okay it doesn't have any cycle if i put

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
another

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,360
link here it's not a trick right it has

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,240
a former cycle okay

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,560
yeah so okay so today's task easy we

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,879
also find out the longest okay first of

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,239
all the longest

52
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,480
even

53
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,840
pass

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,840
longest even pass so

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,879
0 to

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,599
8

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,120
right or 0 to 4 is the longest if i

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,400
change this to like four and change this

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,239
to eight and the longest will be

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,840
zero to eight

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,160
so it could be coming from here or here

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,120
right okay let's say i come i put

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,120
another zero here

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,319
yeah so that would be six notes right so

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,200
so

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:51,319
yeah make sense so we have to step on

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,319
the even numbers yeah

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,720
doing this

69
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,720
any idea

70
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:05,480
any idea how we're doing it um

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,480
think about it it's uh we're doing it

72
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,040
[Applause]

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,599
in this case zero two four zero zero

74
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,280
four eight three eight zero

75
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,799
okay yeah that's good level by level

76
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,040
what's that first search

77
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,640
order i mean if it's uh let's say if

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,680
it's a

79
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,000
if it's were if it's in order in order

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,760
you know that you know that left

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,080
node right

82
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,799
okay in order so that what what's the

83
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,480
sequence for the inorder

84
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,599
yet

85
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,799
in order

86
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,920
okay so in order actually uh

87
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,400
it's it's the other ways is four

88
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,439
two okay so now let's let's let's maybe

89
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,200
do it pre-order let note left and right

90
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,440
okay pre-order

91
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,920
let's be right

92
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,959
[Music]

93
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,040
two

94
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,000
four eight

95
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,239
zero four three eight wait don't forget

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,599
no look we visited the northwest so we

97
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,760
go to the left tree and then we go to

98
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,680
the right tree look yeah yeah and for

99
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,759
the left tree also we go to the null

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,680
first and then left three by three so

101
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,160
it's a recursion yeah we can easily use

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,320
the recursion to do a

103
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,320
different search okay depending on which

104
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,680
order we want okay

105
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,680
okay so look

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,560
we we originally we want to find out the

107
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,199
longest even part right okay okay so how

108
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,360
about if i telling you that dfs this

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,479
function dude

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,360
yeah

111
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,560
this loop tells me the longest

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,240
the longest even pass containing the

113
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,000
root node

114
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,720
right okay so vfs is zero you tell me

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,479
the the longest load will be four

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,320
because zero to a zero right

117
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,919
okay dfs rules

118
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,360
if we represent the longest even past

119
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,080
containing

120
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,360
this node onwards

121
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,400
yeah

122
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,520
so how does that help us

123
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,680
how does that help us

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,320
how does that happen

125
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,560
you you can use that

126
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,560
yes

127
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,639
unless if it's all even

128
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,320
okay so so yeah

129
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,720
quite close okay quite close look so

130
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,639
what how does this help us is that

131
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,240
we can use we can write the diff

132
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,560
definite search function and then we can

133
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,560
compute the path

134
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,000
like longest path containing a node

135
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,720
of this node and it's even yeah if it's

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,639
even we return we accumulate a path

137
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,360
otherwise if the odd number will return

138
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,440
zero right and by dealing with the

139
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,120
recursion we can recall

140
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,840
the

141
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,800
okay we can record the left and right

142
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,680
right

143
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,560
right

144
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,759
yeah

145
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,759
okay so look

146
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,720
this bit yeah

147
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,880
all right this bit

148
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,639
at this bit

149
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,280
this bit the longest the longest even

150
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,919
number containing this node

151
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,280
yeah the even longer longest even past

152
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,400
number continuously is dfs

153
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,919
blue dot left right yeah

154
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,960
at least it

155
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,800
is

156
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
dfs

157
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,440
blue

158
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
right okay

159
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,800
okay

160
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,840
this is the number we just call it

161
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,400
okay so if this is even number right

162
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,919
let's say this is l equals that and this

163
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,440
is r equals

164
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,639
so

165
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,400
if this is the even number right

166
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,080
listen to me carefully if this is an

167
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,199
even number

168
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,280
right

169
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,400
what's the longest

170
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,280
what's the what's the even longest even

171
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,560
longest part even past containing this

172
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,000
node

173
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,120
is that

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,120
and

175
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,800
l and r that's right a plus r plus one

176
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,960
right

177
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,520
it will be the longest right what is

178
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,080
that so look

179
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,880
the past that there can be only two

180
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,440
situation right why is that passing this

181
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,960
note or it doesn't pass this note

182
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,780
right

183
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,160
make sense

184
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,440
[Music]

185
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,360
yeah look at the longest part of a tree

186
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,400
longest part of the tree

187
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,800
right it could be passing the note or it

188
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,280
could be not passing the root note okay

189
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,879
so if i want to pass this one so

190
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,240
it could be something like that or it

191
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,479
could be something like this or

192
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,039
something like that right yeah

193
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,720
okay so i'm saying if this note is even

194
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,680
right

195
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,919
so the

196
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,199
longest path

197
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,240
the rule okay

198
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,160
should be

199
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,840
passing the root note

200
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,000
can contain this one right so it could

201
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,879
be somewhere here connecting here or

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,280
here right am i right if this is odd

203
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,479
number right

204
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,960
i'm right

205
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,720
so i should not include this in the

206
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,240
longest path

207
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,319
right i should not include it in the

208
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,800
longest if it was one

209
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,400
yeah so because it's even it's all all

210
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,479
numbers so the longest part should not

211
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,360
pass this move right so the longest path

212
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,839
could be

213
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,839
these or least all right

214
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,080
the longest is that one

215
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,080
yes

216
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,760
okay so so

217
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,000
make sense so we we the dfs function

218
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,920
returning the okay so dfs function

219
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,680
returning the

220
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,040
longest

221
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,720
even pass the note longest event pass

222
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,680
containing this no the neutral okay yeah

223
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,839
okay

224
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,839
so let's quickly write this okay

225
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,480
and then that's it for today

226
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,880
and you need to tell me they think about

227
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,120
how we're getting this answer okay think

228
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,120
about

229
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,959
let's say longest

230
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,920
long is even okay we are looking for

231
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,959
even

232
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,839
longest

233
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,600
and then loot okay

234
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,959
okay so if not lose obviously return

235
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,600
zero

236
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,680
yeah special case and now we want to

237
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,519
find the longest let's say longest uh

238
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,440
let's say answer okay this is the

239
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,040
elephant is zero

240
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,880
and then we need to define the test

241
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,880
research function right the loot

242
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,839
is not loose again

243
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,519
look if not root return zero right

244
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,920
because the

245
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,240
look this function with uh okay so you

246
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,519
would return the longest

247
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,839
longest even

248
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,320
passing rules okay remember this is

249
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,279
passing load

250
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,920
yeah

251
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,079
now i need to do the air are you i need

252
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,120
to definitely search the router left

253
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,480
okay

254
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,560
so this air is the

255
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,279
longest pass

256
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,079
long is even past on the left tree right

257
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,480
root or left and then r equals one can

258
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,640
you tell me

259
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,640
uh

260
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:35,519
right yeah easy okay now i have the left

261
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,760
and right okay look air and white look

262
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,760
here

263
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,920
eric i'm not i'm writing a tree here

264
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,519
okay

265
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,959
so this is the loot okay this is the

266
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,680
root

267
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,279
this is the root okay

268
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,720
okay

269
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,000
air loot left is this bit right this bit

270
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,279
this bit

271
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,160
is air

272
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,600
yeah

273
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,760
this bin

274
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,880
is r

275
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,680
yeah

276
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,640
okay so now if this root look

277
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,839
if

278
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:14,320
do the value

279
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,320
n one equals zero what does this mean

280
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:29,240
remember the binary yeah zero one one

281
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,240
zero what's next one one what's next

282
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,160
and what's next

283
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,240
[Music]

284
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,399
okay you got it yeah look if it's one

285
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,040
it's odd number if it's zero it's even

286
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,800
number binary yeah yeah

287
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,279
okay now if it's if it said if this note

288
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,760
is even number

289
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,440
if this note is the even number so look

290
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,000
the answer

291
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,040
will be equals the maximum of answer

292
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,279
this is the answer what what

293
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,279
what

294
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,760
what what's the look if this is even

295
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,760
number what's the longest part

296
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,519
one right

297
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,650
yeah

298
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,000
yeah

299
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,560
[Music]

300
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,040
if if root of value is with even number

301
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,880
and then that and we should return what

302
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,399
we should return what

303
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,360
we should return what

304
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,480
we should return

305
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,839
okay so this function return returns the

306
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,279
longest even past passing the loop right

307
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,000
okay

308
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,760
okay so now i want to return now if this

309
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,279
is even number i want to return now so

310
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,560
what should i return which part is

311
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,000
bigger

312
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,760
yeah i need to compare which is this

313
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,560
part is bigger right

314
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,959
and then i need to plus one right

315
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,720
all right

316
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,360
yeah so return one plus maximum

317
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,839
of air and right okay

318
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
yeah if it's all number y should written

319
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,959
one

320
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,120
if this odd number

321
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,120
what's the longest path looking is even

322
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,279
yeah

323
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,200
okay so then look we can do this

324
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,800
definite search rules and then what

325
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,079
should we return what should we return

326
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,480
answer okay look there are two things

327
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,480
two things in this recursion function

328
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,160
can you tell me what are the two things

329
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,519
this function does the recursion

330
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,279
function

331
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,320
what are the two things

332
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,320
what's

333
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,160
what's what's first thing the second

334
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,720
thing what's the first you know what's

335
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,639
this function doing here

336
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,160
it is

337
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,279
uh

338
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,279
what is it

339
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,560
what's this function returning that's

340
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,240
the first thing and what's what what are

341
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,480
we setting this answer here that's the

342
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,760
second thing okay can you explain these

343
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,839
two things

344
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,120
the function returns what value what's

345
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,360
the value

346
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,680
i know what's returning what's this

347
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,680
function

348
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,440
what does it mean can you explain in

349
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,199
your own words okay

350
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,639
what does it mean

351
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,079
it means

352
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,959
it's the longest okay so if this here is

353
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,920
two

354
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,920
okay then you tell me okay

355
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,460
[Music]

356
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,920
okay so i'm cfs blue here so what what

357
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,279
does it return what's this function

358
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,920
return

359
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:44,120
it returns

360
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,120
which number the power

361
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,160
why is it five there are only four steps

362
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,279
why is where the longest pass

363
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,120
which five

364
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,760
2 4 8 10. okay so how many knots four

365
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,480
four four notes okay that's four okay so

366
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,440
this is the longest part containing the

367
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,079
even number okay because look here here

368
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,720
if i put another one ten it's this this

369
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,680
is even old number so it will stop here

370
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,920
right

371
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,800
okay so that's the first thing yeah if

372
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,480
it's

373
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,800
okay how about this one is one what's

374
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,399
this one's literally

375
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,959
i'm sorry

376
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,959
if this is

377
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,000
no that's the second thing i'm saying

378
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,639
that this function returning

379
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,120
longest events are passing

380
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,519
you see this passing here

381
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,839
you say you're passing okay so if i task

382
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,880
load here what's the what's it return

383
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,040
0 because this is all lambda okay here

384
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,920
if you come here right

385
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,079
okay make sense yeah

386
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,639
what's the second thing it does here

387
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,160
what's the second thing

388
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,560
what's the second thing about answer

389
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,560
what's the answer

390
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,639
the second thing if this is one the

391
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,959
second

392
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,320
the the longest path is

393
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,959
is the one you just said which is which

394
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,959
is what eric

395
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,320
the answer let me say answer zero

396
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,320
what's that

397
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,440
what's the longest path containing the

398
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,880
root

399
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,480
well no no

400
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,880
everything here

401
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,639
3 here yeah 4 8 10. it's here yeah it's

402
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,639
a little bit confusing yeah

403
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,759
so that's two things this function does

404
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,079
first thing

405
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,480
is this function return directly the

406
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,199
number of longest

407
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,079
number of longest even nodes

408
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,680
passing the loop okay but we're using

409
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,600
this function

410
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,680
to set the

411
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,279
longest even

412
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,160
path

413
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,079
all without passing the load so far why

414
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,520
is that we said it here this is the

415
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,120
answer you know

416
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,160
every time

417
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,280
we find an even number we set it

418
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,720
right

419
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,799
yeah

420
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,600
makes sense what's the time complexity

421
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,039
if you

422
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,880
think about it what's the time of next

423
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,400
day for the different search

424
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,799
what's the time the next thing is

425
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,439
endnote here what's the thumbnail

426
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,439
what's the space

427
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,160
yeah it's classical textbook right

428
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,160
okay that's it for today bye-bye
