1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,390

hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today
 

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,590
hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today
good okay let's define a sine function

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
good okay let's define a sine function
 

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,270
good okay let's define a sine function
first define

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
first define
 

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,230
first define
sine what are we talking about

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240

 

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,189

yeah yeah but we started s g n sign a

10
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
yeah yeah but we started s g n sign a
 

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,029
yeah yeah but we started s g n sign a
number

12
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,039
number
 

13
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,630
number
okay okay let's divide it look if

14
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
okay okay let's divide it look if
 

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,310
okay okay let's divide it look if
what what equals zero will be times zero

16
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,320
what what equals zero will be times zero
 

17
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,269
what what equals zero will be times zero
uh i'm defining a function yeah

18
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
uh i'm defining a function yeah
 

19
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,310
uh i'm defining a function yeah
if n bigger than zero we return

20
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
if n bigger than zero we return
 

21
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,389
if n bigger than zero we return
one and s will be return

22
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
one and s will be return
 

23
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,350
one and s will be return
zero minus one for negative here is

24
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
zero minus one for negative here is
 

25
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,029
zero minus one for negative here is
negative right

26
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
negative right
 

27
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,350
negative right
yeah that's the sign function right

28
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
yeah that's the sign function right
 

29
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,549
yeah that's the sign function right
negative numbers

30
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
negative numbers
 

31
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,189
negative numbers
so for example sgn 100 what does it

32
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
so for example sgn 100 what does it
 

33
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,950
so for example sgn 100 what does it
return

34
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960

 

35
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,910

sgn 100 you put it here so what does it

36
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
sgn 100 you put it here so what does it
 

37
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,670
sgn 100 you put it here so what does it
return if it's a positive number you

38
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
return if it's a positive number you
 

39
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,630
return if it's a positive number you
should return one

40
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
should return one
 

41
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,390
should return one
one one sg and minus two

42
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
one one sg and minus two
 

43
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,469
one one sg and minus two
return one once one sgn

44
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
return one once one sgn
 

45
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,960
return one once one sgn
technically

46
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:12,970
technically
 

47
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,550
technically
[Music]

48
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560

 

49
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,429

so only three possibilities values come

50
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
so only three possibilities values come
 

51
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,710
so only three possibilities values come
out of this function

52
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
out of this function
 

53
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,870
out of this function
if it's a positive number written one if

54
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
if it's a positive number written one if
 

55
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,990
if it's a positive number written one if
it's the negative number

56
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
it's the negative number
 

57
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,030
it's the negative number
within minus one yeah if it is yellow

58
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
within minus one yeah if it is yellow
 

59
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,510
within minus one yeah if it is yellow
yeah look if it's yellow if it's bigger

60
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
yeah look if it's yellow if it's bigger
 

61
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,109
yeah look if it's yellow if it's bigger
than yellow we can one and

62
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
than yellow we can one and
 

63
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,310
than yellow we can one and
else what else if it's smaller yeah it's

64
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
else what else if it's smaller yeah it's
 

65
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,310
else what else if it's smaller yeah it's
smaller than zero this is the only

66
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
smaller than zero this is the only
 

67
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,590
smaller than zero this is the only
possibility okay

68
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
possibility okay
 

69
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,350
possibility okay
okay so this is the simple stem function

70
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
okay so this is the simple stem function
 

71
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,429
okay so this is the simple stem function
so yes telling if you

72
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
so yes telling if you
 

73
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,510
so yes telling if you
if it's like uh

74
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520

 

75
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,350

yeah yeah okay so given a list of

76
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
yeah yeah okay so given a list of
 

77
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,109
yeah yeah okay so given a list of
numbers like one two

78
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
numbers like one two
 

79
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,030
numbers like one two
zero three minus a hundred

80
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
zero three minus a hundred
 

81
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,270
zero three minus a hundred
uh i have a few numbers i want you to

82
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
uh i have a few numbers i want you to
 

83
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,389
uh i have a few numbers i want you to
find out the sign

84
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
find out the sign
 

85
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,789
find out the sign
value of all the products you multiply

86
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
value of all the products you multiply
 

87
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,469
value of all the products you multiply
yeah yeah okay so look if i want to

88
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
yeah yeah okay so look if i want to
 

89
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,789
yeah yeah okay so look if i want to
i want you to find out the sum function

90
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
i want you to find out the sum function
 

91
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,430
i want you to find out the sum function
of the value this value comes out from

92
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
of the value this value comes out from
 

93
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,190
of the value this value comes out from
for all the products you know that

94
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
for all the products you know that
 

95
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,350
for all the products you know that
multiplied together yeah 1 times 2 times

96
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
multiplied together yeah 1 times 2 times
 

97
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,110
multiplied together yeah 1 times 2 times
0 times 8 times 100

98
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
0 times 8 times 100
 

99
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,550
0 times 8 times 100
so what's the sign value of the product

100
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
so what's the sign value of the product
 

101
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,830
so what's the sign value of the product
of these if you times 0

102
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
of these if you times 0
 

103
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,190
of these if you times 0
yes yeah okay so that will be zero yeah

104
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
yes yeah okay so that will be zero yeah
 

105
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,910
yes yeah okay so that will be zero yeah
if i tell you that is one and what's the

106
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
if i tell you that is one and what's the
 

107
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,790
if i tell you that is one and what's the
exam value

108
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800

 

109
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,589

i can remember this what's the sum value

110
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
i can remember this what's the sum value
 

111
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,830
i can remember this what's the sum value
of these values

112
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
of these values
 

113
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,150
of these values
this

114
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160

 

115
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,630

no first of all times all these values

116
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
no first of all times all these values
 

117
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,309
no first of all times all these values
and then five dollars one times two

118
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
and then five dollars one times two
 

119
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,589
and then five dollars one times two
times one is two two times eight is

120
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
times one is two two times eight is
 

121
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,710
times one is two two times eight is
sixteen sixteen times minus 100

122
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
sixteen sixteen times minus 100
 

123
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,910
sixteen sixteen times minus 100
yeah so if you want to find out

124
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
yeah so if you want to find out
 

125
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,910
yeah so if you want to find out
come on it's easy right i need the

126
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
come on it's easy right i need the
 

127
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,190
come on it's easy right i need the
calculator

128
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
calculator
 

129
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,670
calculator
do you need to actually need this one

130
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
do you need to actually need this one
 

131
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,509
do you need to actually need this one
yeah because

132
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
yeah because
 

133
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,869
yeah because
this is so you don't actually need to

134
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
this is so you don't actually need to
 

135
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,070
this is so you don't actually need to
find out the value right

136
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
find out the value right
 

137
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,830
find out the value right
yeah yeah because we just want to know

138
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
yeah yeah because we just want to know
 

139
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,110
yeah yeah because we just want to know
if it's positive

140
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
if it's positive
 

141
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,910
if it's positive
negative or yellow right yeah

142
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
negative or yellow right yeah
 

143
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,630
negative or yellow right yeah
it's negative not quite sure if i put

144
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
it's negative not quite sure if i put
 

145
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,830
it's negative not quite sure if i put
another negative here

146
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
another negative here
 

147
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,910
another negative here
what happened double negative makes

148
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
what happened double negative makes
 

149
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,430
what happened double negative makes
positive right yeah

150
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
positive right yeah
 

151
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,710
positive right yeah
minus one number yeah

152
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
minus one number yeah
 

153
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,630
minus one number yeah
yeah okay so we want to find out how

154
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
yeah okay so we want to find out how
 

155
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,710
yeah okay so we want to find out how
many first of all we want to find out

156
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
many first of all we want to find out
 

157
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,990
many first of all we want to find out
if less zero if there is zero the sine

158
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
if less zero if there is zero the sine
 

159
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,830
if less zero if there is zero the sine
function will definitely return zero

160
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
function will definitely return zero
 

161
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,309
function will definitely return zero
right

162
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
right
 

163
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,390
right
no matter how big or how small the value

164
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
no matter how big or how small the value
 

165
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,830
no matter how big or how small the value
is the product is

166
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
is the product is
 

167
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,309
is the product is

how many negative signs right yeah

how many negative signs right yeah
 

173
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,030
how many negative signs right yeah
and if it's an even number of negative

174
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
and if it's an even number of negative
 

175
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,830
and if it's an even number of negative
sound

176
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
sound
 

177
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,270

it is one if it's odd number of negative

178
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
it is one if it's odd number of negative
 

179

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,390
minus one where okay let's see but
obviously you can times it together and

obviously you can times it together and
 

185
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,670
obviously you can times it together and
then return it yeah

186
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
then return it yeah
 

187
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,750
then return it yeah

out the actual value okay let's
 

207
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,310
out the actual value okay let's
say let's say uh product plus p equals

we have no and this i is a smaller
 

325
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,270
