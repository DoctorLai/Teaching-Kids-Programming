00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,869

okay what's prefix we talked about this

4
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:06,879
okay what's prefix we talked about this
 

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,350
okay what's prefix we talked about this
prefix before prefix sum

6
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
prefix before prefix sum
 

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,870
prefix before prefix sum
prefix what's the process for example

8
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
prefix what's the process for example
 

9
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,629
prefix what's the process for example
what's prefix

10
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:12,639
what's prefix
 

11
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,310
what's prefix
like look

12
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
like look
 

13
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,029
like look
uh eric what's the prefix of the eric

14
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
uh eric what's the prefix of the eric
 

15
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,550
uh eric what's the prefix of the eric
how many prefix

16
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560

 

17
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,590

how many prefix of these four what are

18
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,600
how many prefix of these four what are
 

19
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,690
how many prefix of these four what are
those

20
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:25,700

23
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,429

i see yeah and we also talk about

24
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
i see yeah and we also talk about
 

25
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,990
i see yeah and we also talk about
surface yeah what's the surface of this

26
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
surface yeah what's the surface of this
 

27
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,990
surface yeah what's the surface of this
what's the surface

28
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
what's the surface
 

29
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,750
what's the surface
um

30
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
um
 

31
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,069
um
come on the opposite c

32
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
come on the opposite c
 

33
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,270
come on the opposite c
c i

34
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
c i
 

35
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,790
c i
uh yeah i see

36
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800

 

37
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,630

you understand this okay and we also

38
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
you understand this okay and we also
 

39
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,310
you understand this okay and we also
talked about the prefix sum okay we

40
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
talked about the prefix sum okay we
 

41
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,709
talked about the prefix sum okay we
talked about quickly some today remember

42
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
talked about quickly some today remember
 

43
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,470
talked about quickly some today remember
why do we need to quickly sign suppose

44
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
why do we need to quickly sign suppose
 

45
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,150
why do we need to quickly sign suppose
we have an array like

46
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
we have an array like
 

47
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,630
we have an array like
one two three four five six seven

48
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
one two three four five six seven
 

49
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,110
one two three four five six seven
okay so this is an array with and i just

50
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
okay so this is an array with and i just
 

51
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,149
okay so this is an array with and i just
items okay and if i tell you like i want

52
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
items okay and if i tell you like i want
 

53
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,510
items okay and if i tell you like i want
to calculate

54
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
to calculate
 

55
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,310
to calculate
the sum the sum between any two any

56
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
the sum the sum between any two any
 

57
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,990
the sum the sum between any two any
ranges for example i want to calculate

58
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
ranges for example i want to calculate
 

59
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,350
ranges for example i want to calculate
some between

60
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
some between
 

61
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,910
some between
three to five so what's the sum

62
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
three to five so what's the sum
 

63
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,230
three to five so what's the sum
three plus four plus five right

64
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
three plus four plus five right
 

65
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,109
three plus four plus five right
yeah

66
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
yeah
 

67
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,550
yeah
three plus four plus five which is

68
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
three plus four plus five which is
 

69
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,950
three plus four plus five which is
twelve what's the term complexity if i

70
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
twelve what's the term complexity if i
 

71
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,469
twelve what's the term complexity if i
just do it

72
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
just do it
 

73
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,710
just do it
like that you know blue force if you if

74
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
like that you know blue force if you if
 

75
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,310
like that you know blue force if you if
you tell me okay i want to start from

76
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
you tell me okay i want to start from
 

77
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,030
you tell me okay i want to start from
the

78
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
the
 

79
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,429
the
uh the lower ranges from three the upper

80
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
uh the lower ranges from three the upper
 

81
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,030
uh the lower ranges from three the upper
branch is five

82
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
branch is five
 

83
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,510
branch is five
and can you tell me the sum

84
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
and can you tell me the sum
 

85
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,230
and can you tell me the sum
and then we just do a loop for i in

86
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
and then we just do a loop for i in
 

87
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,870
and then we just do a loop for i in
range from three up to five okay and

88
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
range from three up to five okay and
 

89
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,350
range from three up to five okay and
then some answer plus equals the value

90
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
then some answer plus equals the value
 

91
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,149
then some answer plus equals the value
yeah

92
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
yeah
 

93
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,590
yeah
what's the time complexity for this one

94
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600

 

95
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,469

and we're done because this the open if

96
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
and we're done because this the open if
 

97
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,789
and we're done because this the open if
the end if the lower range is yellow

98
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
the end if the lower range is yellow
 

99
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,990
the end if the lower range is yellow
right

100
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
right
 

101
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,550
right
upper range is the end

102
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
upper range is the end
 

103
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,429
upper range is the end
right

104
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
right
 

105
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,830
right
and then this eventually will be

106
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
and then this eventually will be
 

107
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,310
and then this eventually will be
looping all the i elements in the array

108
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
looping all the i elements in the array
 

109
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,229
looping all the i elements in the array
and then getting this sound low v-o-n

110
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
and then getting this sound low v-o-n
 

111
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,110
and then getting this sound low v-o-n
which is very slow uh not very fast okay

112
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
which is very slow uh not very fast okay
 

113
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,229
which is very slow uh not very fast okay
so how can we do

114
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239

 

115
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,190

you know n is a minion it's a slow right

116
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
you know n is a minion it's a slow right
 

117
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,750
you know n is a minion it's a slow right
yeah

118
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760

 

119
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,150

o-n is low compared to a one if we can

120
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
o-n is low compared to a one if we can
 

121
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,630
o-n is low compared to a one if we can
do it over one how can we do this one if

122
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
do it over one how can we do this one if
 

123
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,589
do it over one how can we do this one if
if

124
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
if
 

125
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,990
if
if we already know if we do this you

126
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
if we already know if we do this you
 

127
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,470
if we already know if we do this you
know if we're calling this many many

128
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
know if we're calling this many many
 

129
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,830
know if we're calling this many many
times yes if we want to speed up the

130
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
times yes if we want to speed up the
 

131
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,030
times yes if we want to speed up the
calculation of such uh such things such

132
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
calculation of such uh such things such
 

133
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,270
calculation of such uh such things such
as the sum between n and range okay all

134
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
as the sum between n and range okay all
 

135
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,430
as the sum between n and range okay all
right so how can we do this remember we

136
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
right so how can we do this remember we
 

137
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,949
right so how can we do this remember we
talked about a prefix sum how can we

138
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
talked about a prefix sum how can we
 

139
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,309
talked about a prefix sum how can we
calculate the previous sound so look

140
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
calculate the previous sound so look
 

141
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,150
calculate the previous sound so look
what's the prefix sum

142
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
what's the prefix sum
 

143
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,309
what's the prefix sum
what's the prefix sum of this eric can

144
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
what's the prefix sum of this eric can
 

145
00:02:48,319 --> 00:03:02,229
what's the prefix sum of this eric can
you tell me

146
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239

 

147
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,710

three plus three six yeah it's one plus

148
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
three plus three six yeah it's one plus
 

149
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,790
three plus three six yeah it's one plus
two plus three yeah so basically the sum

150
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
two plus three yeah so basically the sum
 

151
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,990
two plus three yeah so basically the sum
the values will be updated to the sum

152
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
the values will be updated to the sum
 

153
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,550
the values will be updated to the sum
of all the elements from the beginning

154
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
of all the elements from the beginning
 

155
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,070
of all the elements from the beginning
up to it right so what's next

156
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
up to it right so what's next
 

157
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,390
up to it right so what's next
ten ten yeah

158
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
ten ten yeah
 

159
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,869
ten ten yeah
and yeah 15 15 21

160
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
and yeah 15 15 21
 

161
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,110
and yeah 15 15 21
wait

162
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
wait
 

163
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,110
wait
so why is this useful because we only

164
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
so why is this useful because we only
 

165
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,190
so why is this useful because we only
get to calculate these ones right we

166
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
get to calculate these ones right we
 

167
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,869
get to calculate these ones right we
only calculate this one then we can use

168
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
only calculate this one then we can use
 

169
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,190
only calculate this one then we can use
these to calculate the sum between three

170
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
these to calculate the sum between three
 

171
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,830
these to calculate the sum between three
to five how do we get this

172
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
to five how do we get this
 

173
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,149
to five how do we get this
how to get the sum between here

174
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
how to get the sum between here
 

175
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,949
how to get the sum between here
okay the sum of these three elements is

176
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
okay the sum of these three elements is
 

177
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,350
okay the sum of these three elements is
it because it's equal to the sum of

178
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
it because it's equal to the sum of
 

179
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,589
it because it's equal to the sum of
these five elements but

180
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
these five elements but
 

181
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,509
these five elements but
minus these two elements

182
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
minus these two elements
 

183
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,710
minus these two elements
all right

184
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
all right
 

185
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,949
all right
look this i want to get the

186
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
look this i want to get the
 

187
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,670
look this i want to get the
ryan eric look ryan look

188
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
ryan eric look ryan look
 

189
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,110
ryan eric look ryan look
the sum of three four five right right

190
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
the sum of three four five right right
 

191
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,350
the sum of three four five right right
is it equals to the sum of one plus two

192
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
is it equals to the sum of one plus two
 

193
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,589
is it equals to the sum of one plus two
plus three four five right minus the sum

194
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
plus three four five right minus the sum
 

195
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,429
plus three four five right minus the sum
between one to two right

196
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
between one to two right
 

197
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,110
between one to two right
so okay so can you tell me the sum of

198
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
so okay so can you tell me the sum of
 

199
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,030
so okay so can you tell me the sum of
one to five which is

200
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
one to five which is
 

201
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,229
one to five which is
fifteen

202
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
fifteen
 

203
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,509
fifteen
the sum of

204
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
the sum of
 

205
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,110
the sum of
one plus two

206
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
one plus two
 

207
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,030
one plus two
yeah we just look it up yeah

208
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
yeah we just look it up yeah
 

209
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,550
yeah we just look it up yeah
so the sum of three plus four five

210
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
so the sum of three plus four five
 

211
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,670
so the sum of three plus four five
two

212
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
two
 

213
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,150
two
which one which one is faster this one

214
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
which one which one is faster this one
 

215
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,670
which one which one is faster this one
this one what's the time complexity for

216
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
this one what's the time complexity for
 

217
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,469
this one what's the time complexity for
this one

218
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
this one
 

219
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,030
this one
or one yeah if we are not considering

220
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
or one yeah if we are not considering
 

221
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,790
or one yeah if we are not considering
the building up because we only need to

222
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
the building up because we only need to
 

223
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,189
the building up because we only need to
build this up what's the time complexity

224
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
build this up what's the time complexity
 

225
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,469
build this up what's the time complexity
to be at least the prefix array

226
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
to be at least the prefix array
 

227
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,270
to be at least the prefix array
what

228
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
what
 

229
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,629
what
what's that

230
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
what's that
 

231
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,570
what's that
oh

232
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:35,580
oh
 

233
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,590
oh
[Music]

234
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
[Music]
 

235
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,110
[Music]
and yeah because we need to go through

236
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
and yeah because we need to go through
 

237
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,629
and yeah because we need to go through
this

238
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
this
 

239
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,350
this
one

240
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
one
 

241
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,909
one
so okay let's review this how do we

242
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
so okay let's review this how do we
 

243
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,390
so okay let's review this how do we
calculate these uh the prefix sum for

244
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
calculate these uh the prefix sum for
 

245
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,590
calculate these uh the prefix sum for
the array okay how do we get today

246
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
the array okay how do we get today
 

247
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,350
the array okay how do we get today
it's easier

248
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
it's easier
 

249
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,110
it's easier
define

250
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
define
 

251
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,870
define
prefix clear the prefix okay prefix sum

252
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
prefix clear the prefix okay prefix sum
 

253
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,830
prefix clear the prefix okay prefix sum
if this is the data yeah data

254
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
if this is the data yeah data
 

255
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,310
if this is the data yeah data
so how do we do this all right look

256
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
so how do we do this all right look
 

257
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,230
so how do we do this all right look
how do we do this um

258
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
how do we do this um
 

259
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,310
how do we do this um
n equals length

260
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
n equals length
 

261
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,230
n equals length
theta right

262
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
theta right
 

263
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,230
theta right
if n equals zero we just return all

264
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
if n equals zero we just return all
 

265
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,469
if n equals zero we just return all
right because it's uh we just returned

266
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
right because it's uh we just returned
 

267
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,830
right because it's uh we just returned
nothing okay

268
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
nothing okay
 

269
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,430
nothing okay
and then what should we do

270
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
and then what should we do
 

271
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,469
and then what should we do
all right

272
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
all right
 

273
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,430
all right
for

274
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
for
 

275
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,310
for
i

276
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320

in
 

279
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,830
in
range we start from the first one right

280
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
range we start from the first one right
 

281
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,270
range we start from the first one right
and up to n

282
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
and up to n
 

283
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,749
and up to n
can you tell me what to do theta

284
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
can you tell me what to do theta
 

285
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,670
can you tell me what to do theta
theta one look

286
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
theta one look
 

287
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,990
theta one look
one two three we start from the second

288
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
one two three we start from the second
 

289
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,590
one two three we start from the second
one second universe yeah so theta i

290
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
one second universe yeah so theta i
 

291
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,510
one second universe yeah so theta i
equals one one

292
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
equals one one
 

293
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,629
equals one one
right

294
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
right
 

295
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,469
right
theta

296
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
theta
 

297
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,430
theta
i need to plus the previous one right

298
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
i need to plus the previous one right
 

299
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,550
i need to plus the previous one right
right and theta i plus equal

300
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
right and theta i plus equal
 

301
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,230
right and theta i plus equal
minus theta i minus one yeah

302
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
minus theta i minus one yeah
 

303
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,990
minus theta i minus one yeah
that's it

304
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
that's it
 

305
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,390
that's it
look remember we use the function

341
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,189
i i uh at least return
is written data and then i can just do

342
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
is written data and then i can just do
 

343
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,070
is written data and then i can just do
it return

344
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
it return
 

345
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,749
it return
convert to this because accumulator

346
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
convert to this because accumulator
 

347
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,150
convert to this because accumulator
retain the iterator accumulate

348
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
retain the iterator accumulate
 

349
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,390
retain the iterator accumulate
accumulate

350
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
accumulate
 

351
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,950
accumulate
data and that's it

352
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
data and that's it
 

353
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,870
data and that's it
yeah we talked about this before so this

354
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
yeah we talked about this before so this
 

355
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,350
yeah we talked about this before so this
thing these three lines is equal to this

356
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
thing these three lines is equal to this
 

357
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,790
thing these three lines is equal to this
accumulation okay like we have a

358
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
accumulation okay like we have a
 

359
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,270
accumulation okay like we have a
built-in function okay okay let's review

360
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
built-in function okay okay let's review
 

361
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,790
built-in function okay okay let's review
okay let's talk about the subject today

362
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
okay let's talk about the subject today
 

363
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,270
okay let's talk about the subject today
which is the prefix sum for matching

364
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
which is the prefix sum for matching
 

365
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,150
which is the prefix sum for matching
which is a 2d remember we

366
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160

 

367
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,309

yeah one dimensional okay don't touch it

368
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
yeah one dimensional okay don't touch it
 

369
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,909
yeah one dimensional okay don't touch it
it's shaking okay

370
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
it's shaking okay
 

371
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,150
it's shaking okay
the array is one dimensional right all

372
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
the array is one dimensional right all
 

373
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,670
the array is one dimensional right all
right one d

374
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
right one d
 

375
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,629
right one d
all right

376
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
all right
 

377
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,150
all right
2d what's 2d

378
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160

look 1d
 

383
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,589
look 1d
1d a line 2d

384
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
1d a line 2d
 

385
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,870
1d a line 2d
a plan 3d you know we are living in a 3d

386
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
a plan 3d you know we are living in a 3d
 

387
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,270
a plan 3d you know we are living in a 3d
space right 3d yeah

388
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
space right 3d yeah
 

389
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,430
space right 3d yeah
z right look at one d

390
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
z right look at one d
 

391
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,309
z right look at one d
x

392
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
x
 

393
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,230
x
is a line 2d

394
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
is a line 2d
 

395
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,990
is a line 2d

397
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,589
x y
what's 3d

398
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
what's 3d
 

399
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,510
what's 3d
x

400
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
x
 

401
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,230
x
y and then there's a z i can't put it

402
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
y and then there's a z i can't put it
 

403
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,629
y and then there's a z i can't put it
here you know you you you put a you know

404
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
here you know you you you put a you know
 

405
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,950
here you know you you you put a you know
this is the key way yeah cubic 3d yeah

406
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
this is the key way yeah cubic 3d yeah
 

407
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,469
this is the key way yeah cubic 3d yeah
2d

408
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
2d
 

409
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,670
2d
square one d a line okay

410
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
square one d a line okay
 

411
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,350
square one d a line okay
yeah got it let's play basic so 2d magic

412
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
yeah got it let's play basic so 2d magic
 

413
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,270
yeah got it let's play basic so 2d magic
we have a 2d x and y

414
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
we have a 2d x and y
 

415
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,110
we have a 2d x and y
so look metric

416
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
so look metric
 

417
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,830
so look metric
zero one two

418
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
zero one two
 

419
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,749
zero one two
two one four

420
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
two one four
 

421
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,710
two one four
that is a three two one okay this is the

422
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
that is a three two one okay this is the
 

423
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,230
that is a three two one okay this is the
three times three matching

424
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240

 

425
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,629

how many rows does it have

426
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639

 

427
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,350

three yes the index will be zero one two

428
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
three yes the index will be zero one two
 

429
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,430
three yes the index will be zero one two
what's the how many columns does it have

430
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
what's the how many columns does it have
 

431
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,830
what's the how many columns does it have
three yeah three so zero one two the

432
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
three yeah three so zero one two the
 

433
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,629
three yeah three so zero one two the
index okay so we want to change this to

434
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
index okay so we want to change this to
 

435
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,150
index okay so we want to change this to
magic to

436
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
magic to
 

437
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,150
magic to
convert it to a prefix method what's a

438
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
convert it to a prefix method what's a
 

439
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,949
convert it to a prefix method what's a
prefix metric prefix sum matching

440
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
prefix metric prefix sum matching
 

441
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,070
prefix metric prefix sum matching
so all every element will be updated to

442
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
so all every element will be updated to
 

443
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,790
so all every element will be updated to
the sum of all elements from the top

444
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
the sum of all elements from the top
 

445
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,469
the sum of all elements from the top
left corner to itself well for example

446
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
left corner to itself well for example
 

447
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,870
left corner to itself well for example
like cll would be zero and here i want

448
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
like cll would be zero and here i want
 

449
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,590
like cll would be zero and here i want
to update this one would be one error

450
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
to update this one would be one error
 

451
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,710
to update this one would be one error
zero plus one okay and here look this is

452
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
zero plus one okay and here look this is
 

453
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,630
zero plus one okay and here look this is
the first row is the same as we talked

454
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
the first row is the same as we talked
 

455
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,990
the first row is the same as we talked
about the accumulated function right

456
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
about the accumulated function right
 

457
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,870
about the accumulated function right
eric look will be zero plus one plus two

458
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
eric look will be zero plus one plus two
 

459
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,670
eric look will be zero plus one plus two
right

460
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
right
 

461
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,310
right
and then took zero plus two

462
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
and then took zero plus two
 

463
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,269
and then took zero plus two
here

464
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
here
 

465
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,710
here
here will be the sum of these four

466
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
here will be the sum of these four
 

467
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,670
here will be the sum of these four
elements right zero plus one plus two

468
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
elements right zero plus one plus two
 

469
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,829
elements right zero plus one plus two
plus one and then four

470
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
plus one and then four
 

471
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,150
plus one and then four
will be the sum of all these six

472
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
will be the sum of all these six
 

473
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,949
will be the sum of all these six
elements okay and here will be zero plus

474
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
elements okay and here will be zero plus
 

475
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,870
elements okay and here will be zero plus
two plus three yeah

476
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880
two plus three yeah
 

477
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,150
two plus three yeah
and then two

478
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
and then two
 

479
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,030
and then two
will be all these six elements right and

480
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
will be all these six elements right and
 

481
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,949
will be all these six elements right and
one will be all the nine elements that's

482
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
one will be all the nine elements that's
 

483
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,310
one will be all the nine elements that's
it yeah

484
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
it yeah
 

485
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,150
it yeah
ah okay

486
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160

 

487
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,949

okay so how can we do this is there any

488
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
okay so how can we do this is there any
 

489
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,110
okay so how can we do this is there any
idea of honey

490
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
idea of honey
 

491
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,150
idea of honey
yeah i know

492
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
yeah i know
 

493
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,269
yeah i know
then how do we do this we can do what

494
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
then how do we do this we can do what
 

495
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,190
then how do we do this we can do what
yeah because these two yeah each element

496
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
yeah because these two yeah each element
 

497
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,110
yeah because these two yeah each element
right

498
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
right
 

499
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,630
right
right each element would be the sum

500
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
right each element would be the sum
 

501
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,030
right each element would be the sum
will contain the sum of the previous one

502
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
will contain the sum of the previous one
 

503
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,350
will contain the sum of the previous one
right so if we update the

504
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
right so if we update the
 

505
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,990
right so if we update the
if look for each row eric what happened

506

519
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,990
it two step the first one is i do this
for each row for each row i do that

520
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
for each row for each row i do that
 

521
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,829

567
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,110
oh yeah i i'm just doing this for for
each row right containing the sum of the

568
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
each row right containing the sum of the
 

569
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,550
each row right containing the sum of the
previous one and then can you guess

00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
happened to the next column where the
 

581
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,470
happened to the next column where the
hot colors we just don't need that so

ten ten
 

609
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,190
ten ten
sixteen okay let's just check ten is it

610
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
sixteen okay let's just check ten is it
 

611
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,350
sixteen okay let's just check ten is it
the same okay look zero plus one plus

612
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
the same okay look zero plus one plus
 

613
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,550
the same okay look zero plus one plus
two

614
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
two
 

615
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,790

six plus four
ten yeah you see we got this correct

622
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
ten yeah you see we got this correct
 

623
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,190
ten yeah you see we got this correct
let's check this again is it nine zero

624
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
let's check this again is it nine zero
 

625
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,949
let's check this again is it nine zero
plus one

626
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
plus one
 

627
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,829

seven plus two
nine okay yeah does it make sense so

636
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
nine okay yeah does it make sense so
 

637
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,269
nine okay yeah does it make sense so
first of all we do the rows accumulate

638
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
first of all we do the rows accumulate
 

639
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,590
first of all we do the rows accumulate
and we do the columns accumulate

640
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
and we do the columns accumulate
 

641
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,990
and we do the columns accumulate
simple

642
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
simple
 

643
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,750
simple
what's the term complexity for this

644
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
what's the term complexity for this
 

645
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,550
what's the term complexity for this
approach i will see what's r and c

646
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
approach i will see what's r and c
 

647
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,550
approach i will see what's r and c
right and columns we're done good job

648
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
right and columns we're done good job
 

649
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,550
right and columns we're done good job
okay let's do this it should be quick

650
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
okay let's do this it should be quick
 

651
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,060
okay let's do this it should be quick
okay

652
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,070

but i need to look at some of these and
 

825
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,710
but i need to look at some of these and
then minus one

826
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
then minus one
 

827
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,710
then minus one
minus sum of

828
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:30,720
minus sum of
 

829
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,870

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
these
 

831
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,590
these
right and the minus this bit right

832
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
right and the minus this bit right
 

833
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,550
right and the minus this bit right
yeah

834
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
yeah
 

835
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,749

uh
 

841
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,870
uh
yeah so if i want to calculate this

842
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
yeah so if i want to calculate this
 

843
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,189
yeah so if i want to calculate this
fourth term i need to calculate i need

844
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
fourth term i need to calculate i need
 

845
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,110
fourth term i need to calculate i need
