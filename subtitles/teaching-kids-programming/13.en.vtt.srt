1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,470

so

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480
so
 

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,709
so
today we are going to learn something

4
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
today we are going to learn something
 

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,070
today we are going to learn something
about the

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
about the
 

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,430
about the
gcb yeah

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
gcb yeah
 

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,950
gcb yeah
okay good and how about this

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960

 

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,589

multiple okay so what's gcp

12
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
multiple okay so what's gcp
 

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,630
multiple okay so what's gcp
can you give me an example like 25 and

14
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
can you give me an example like 25 and
 

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,109
can you give me an example like 25 and
35 what's the greatest common device of

16
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
35 what's the greatest common device of
 

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:31,669
35 what's the greatest common device of
these

18
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
these
 

19
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,030
these
five five weather and what what's the

20
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
five five weather and what what's the
 

21
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,510
five five weather and what what's the
least common multiple of

22
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
least common multiple of
 

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,050
least common multiple of
of these two

24
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:41,060

 

25
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,630

[Music]

26
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
[Music]
 

27
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,830
[Music]
it's hard yeah seven five

28
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
it's hard yeah seven five
 

29
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,190
it's hard yeah seven five
okay you can turn how hard to do it it's

30
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
okay you can turn how hard to do it it's
 

31
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,990
okay you can turn how hard to do it it's
easy

32
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
easy
 

33
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,709
easy
so yeah times it multiply together

34
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
so yeah times it multiply together
 

35
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,790
so yeah times it multiply together
divided by their greatest common divisor

36
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
divided by their greatest common divisor
 

37
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,389
divided by their greatest common divisor
which is five

38
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
which is five
 

39
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,709
which is five
so do you get it yeah yeah at least

40
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
so do you get it yeah yeah at least
 

41
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,830
so do you get it yeah yeah at least
common multiple

42
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
common multiple
 

43
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,670
common multiple
of a and b equals a times b

44
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
of a and b equals a times b
 

45
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,469
of a and b equals a times b
divided by greatest common divisor of a

46
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
divided by greatest common divisor of a
 

47
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,190
divided by greatest common divisor of a
and b okay

48
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
and b okay
 

49
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,510
and b okay
got it yes so what is common divisor is

50
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
got it yes so what is common divisor is
 

51
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,070
got it yes so what is common divisor is
that both numbers appear in

52
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
that both numbers appear in
 

53
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,630
that both numbers appear in
a time table for example in five times

54
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
a time table for example in five times
 

55
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,230
a time table for example in five times
the table right

56
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
the table right
 

57
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,190
the table right
they are both in five table right yeah

58
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
they are both in five table right yeah
 

59
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,230
they are both in five table right yeah
but it's the biggest one okay so how do

60
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
but it's the biggest one okay so how do
 

61
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,270
but it's the biggest one okay so how do
we do this

62
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
we do this
 

63
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,270
we do this
25 and 35 how do we do the

64
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
25 and 35 how do we do the
 

65
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,030
25 and 35 how do we do the
how hard we calculate the weight is

66
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
how hard we calculate the weight is
 

67
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,550
how hard we calculate the weight is
common divisor

68
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560

 

69
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,550

how do we do it remember

70
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
how do we do it remember
 

71
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,069
how do we do it remember
we need we need this modulus yeah

72
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
we need we need this modulus yeah
 

73
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,510
we need we need this modulus yeah
this modulus you know modulus

74
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520

 

75
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,710

yeah modulus so

76
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
yeah modulus so
 

77
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,410
yeah modulus so
i

78
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:00,420

 

79
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,870

[Applause]

80
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880

 

81
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,990

look so yeah so

82
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
look so yeah so
 

83
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,910
look so yeah so
let's do this 25 divided by 35

84
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
let's do this 25 divided by 35
 

85
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,470
let's do this 25 divided by 35
equals what equals zero remained

86
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
equals what equals zero remained
 

87
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,869
equals what equals zero remained
25 yeah yeah and then we move this 35

88
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
25 yeah yeah and then we move this 35
 

89
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,190
25 yeah yeah and then we move this 35
here and we move this 25 here

90
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
here and we move this 25 here
 

91
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,229
here and we move this 25 here
okay then what's this 35 divided by 20

92
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
okay then what's this 35 divided by 20
 

93
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,790
okay then what's this 35 divided by 20
by 25 equals 1 remaining 10 10 right

94
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
by 25 equals 1 remaining 10 10 right
 

95
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,070
by 25 equals 1 remaining 10 10 right
then okay so what do we do look look

96
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
then okay so what do we do look look
 

97
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,270
then okay so what do we do look look
look 25 here

98
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
look 25 here
 

99
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,190
look 25 here
10 here so 25 and 10 equals

100
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
10 here so 25 and 10 equals
 

101
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,949
10 here so 25 and 10 equals
2 divided by 2 it remains what

102
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
2 divided by 2 it remains what
 

103
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,630
2 divided by 2 it remains what
remain 5 right ok what do we do

104
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
remain 5 right ok what do we do
 

105
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,670
remain 5 right ok what do we do
10 5

106
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
10 5
 

107
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,190
10 5
so let's equals 2 divided by 2

108
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
so let's equals 2 divided by 2
 

109
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,869
so let's equals 2 divided by 2
5 equals 2 remain 0. when we get this

110
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
5 equals 2 remain 0. when we get this
 

111
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,149
5 equals 2 remain 0. when we get this
0 what does it mean it means

112
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
0 what does it mean it means
 

113
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,229
0 what does it mean it means
this number is the greatest common

114
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
this number is the greatest common
 

115
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,309
this number is the greatest common
divisor you see it

116
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
divisor you see it
 

117
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,509
divisor you see it
you see okay so how do we implement this

118
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
you see okay so how do we implement this
 

119
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,550
you see okay so how do we implement this
into computer

120
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
into computer
 

121
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,990
into computer
that's easy yeah look it's just three

122
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
that's easy yeah look it's just three
 

123
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,030
that's easy yeah look it's just three
lines of curve

124
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
lines of curve
 

125
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,790
lines of curve
define where it is common divisor

126
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
define where it is common divisor
 

127
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,470
define where it is common divisor
a and b yeah

128
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
a and b yeah
 

129
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,830
a and b yeah
why b is greater than zero

130
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
why b is greater than zero
 

131
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,070
why b is greater than zero
what should we do now with a

132
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
what should we do now with a
 

133
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,149
what should we do now with a
b equals b a modulus b

134
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
b equals b a modulus b
 

135
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,149
b equals b a modulus b
and then we turn a right

136
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
and then we turn a right
 

137
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,509
and then we turn a right
is it right a

138
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
is it right a
 

139
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,789
is it right a
yes within a yeah we can do this 35

140
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
yes within a yeah we can do this 35
 

141
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,229
yes within a yeah we can do this 35
uh 25 and 25

142
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
uh 25 and 25
 

143
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,670
uh 25 and 25
and 15 okay a is 25

144
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
and 15 okay a is 25
 

145
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,190
and 15 okay a is 25
b is 50 okay b is 35 okay b

146
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
b is 50 okay b is 35 okay b
 

147
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,949
b is 50 okay b is 35 okay b
is 35 now let's do this table

148
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
is 35 now let's do this table
 

149
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,270
is 35 now let's do this table
so let's do this table b is bigger than

150
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
so let's do this table b is bigger than
 

151
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,789
so let's do this table b is bigger than
zero right

152
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
zero right
 

153
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,070
zero right
okay so a equals b and

154
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
okay so a equals b and
 

155
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,589
okay so a equals b and
b equals a modulus b so which is 25 okay

156
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
b equals a modulus b so which is 25 okay
 

157
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,830
b equals a modulus b so which is 25 okay
so now we just swap if it's smaller than

158
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
so now we just swap if it's smaller than
 

159
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,069
so now we just swap if it's smaller than
if a is smaller than b the next one will

160
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
if a is smaller than b the next one will
 

161
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,030
if a is smaller than b the next one will
be b a b

162
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
be b a b
 

163
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,310
be b a b
is so okay now next one

164
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
is so okay now next one
 

165
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,350
is so okay now next one
b is bigger than zero right

166
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
b is bigger than zero right
 

167
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,909
b is bigger than zero right
a will become b right every time you put

168
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
a will become b right every time you put
 

169
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,629
a will become b right every time you put
a b here

170
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
a b here
 

171
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,990
a b here
and then and and b will become a modulus

172
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
and then and and b will become a modulus
 

173
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,230
and then and and b will become a modulus
b

174
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
b
 

175
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,950
b
which is 10 right and then i'm copying

176
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
which is 10 right and then i'm copying
 

177
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,749
which is 10 right and then i'm copying
here 10

178
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
here 10
 

179
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,430
here 10
and then these will be 5 right

180
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440

 

181
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,110

and then these five here and then it

182
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
and then these five here and then it
 

183
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,070
and then these five here and then it
will be zero zero one is zero i return

184
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
will be zero zero one is zero i return
 

185
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,430
will be zero zero one is zero i return
a you see you see

186
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
a you see you see
 

187
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,790
a you see you see
a b a comma b equals b

188
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
a b a comma b equals b
 

189
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,150
a b a comma b equals b
comma a it means that i a will become

190
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
comma a it means that i a will become
 

191
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,590
comma a it means that i a will become
the value of b

192
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
the value of b
 

193
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,070
the value of b
and then b will become the value of a

194
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
and then b will become the value of a
 

195
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,990
and then b will become the value of a
modulus b

196
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
modulus b
 

197
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,110
modulus b
do you get it okay so now

198
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120

 

199
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,830

now how can we do this how can we do

200
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
now how can we do this how can we do
 

201
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,029
now how can we do this how can we do
this lcm look

202
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
this lcm look
 

203
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,469
this lcm look
define scm a

204
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
define scm a
 

205
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,990
define scm a
b okay that's the magic glam how do we

206
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
b okay that's the magic glam how do we
 

207
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,710
b okay that's the magic glam how do we
do it

208
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
do it
 

209
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:29,660
do it
what's this what's

210
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:29,670

remember 25 35 how
 

215
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,189
remember 25 35 how
what did i teach you before at the

216
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
what did i teach you before at the
 

217
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,070
what did i teach you before at the
beginning you say it's a big number

218
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
beginning you say it's a big number
 

219
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,350
beginning you say it's a big number
25 times 35 divided by what is common

220
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
25 times 35 divided by what is common
 

221
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,550
25 times 35 divided by what is common
divisor of yeah

222
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
divisor of yeah
 

223
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:58,830
divisor of yeah
so so what's this

224
