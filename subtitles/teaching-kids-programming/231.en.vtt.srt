numbers in each group
 

67
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,950
numbers in each group
needs to be unique right they can be the

68

it in uh put the same number into two

78
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
it in uh put the same number into two
 

79
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,709
it in uh put the same number into two
different groups or more groups let's

80
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
different groups or more groups let's
 

81
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,350

so what's your idea of doing that okay
 

93
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,510
so what's your idea of doing that okay
so for example given a list of numbers

94
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
so for example given a list of numbers
 

95
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,630
so for example given a list of numbers
one two three

96
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
one two three
 

97
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,070
one two three
if we want to count the number of

you want to count the number of
 

103
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,550
you want to count the number of
frequencies what's your

104
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
frequencies what's your
 

105
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,070
frequencies what's your
what's the what's the how how do we do

106
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
what's the what's the how how do we do
 

107
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,509

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,550
change three to achievement it doesn't
impact the answer right so the problem

172
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
impact the answer right so the problem
 

173
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,390
impact the answer right so the problem
is that we only need to

174
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
is that we only need to
 

175
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,629
is that we only need to
take consideration of these numbers the

176
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
take consideration of these numbers the
 

177
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,870
take consideration of these numbers the
count the number of actually count yeah

178
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
count the number of actually count yeah
 

179
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,230
count the number of actually count yeah
all right

180
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
all right
 

181
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,629
all right
yeah and if i write these numbers let's

182
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
yeah and if i write these numbers let's
 

183
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,909
yeah and if i write these numbers let's
say if i write these numbers in an array

184
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
say if i write these numbers in an array
 

185
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,110
say if i write these numbers in an array
like 2 2 4

186
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120

 

187
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,629

look this is the number of times of the

188
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
look this is the number of times of the
 

189
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,469
look this is the number of times of the
frequency okay can it be grouped into

190
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
frequency okay can it be grouped into
 

191
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,070
frequency okay can it be grouped into
the

192
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
the
 

193
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,629
the
the groups with the same size and each

194
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
the groups with the same size and each
 

195
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,030
the groups with the same size and each
group has the same size at least one

196
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
group has the same size at least one
 

197
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,390
group has the same size at least one
can it to the 4

198
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400

 

199
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,070

then what i mean is that there are two

200
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
then what i mean is that there are two
 

201
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,430
then what i mean is that there are two
numbers

202
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
numbers
 

203
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,990
numbers
two numbers of elements a two numbers

204
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
two numbers of elements a two numbers
 

205
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,870
two numbers of elements a two numbers
are element b

206
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
are element b
 

207
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,150
are element b
and four numbers are element c okay

208
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
and four numbers are element c okay
 

209
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,830
and four numbers are element c okay
yeah okay and how about four

210
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
yeah okay and how about four
 

211
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,270
yeah okay and how about four
six a is okay

212
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
six a is okay
 

213
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,550
six a is okay
uh yeah yeah yeah

214
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
uh yeah yeah yeah
 

215
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,550
uh yeah yeah yeah
okay a tricky one like

216
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560

 

217
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,950

2 2 7

218
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
2 2 7
 

219
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,629
2 2 7
14.

220
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639

 

221
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,590

wait let

222
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600

 

223
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,870

i didn't say that this time okay

224
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
i didn't say that this time okay
 

225
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,430
i didn't say that this time okay
okay so 2 7 14 is that okay

226
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
okay so 2 7 14 is that okay
 

227
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,510
okay so 2 7 14 is that okay
why is that 7 and

228
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
why is that 7 and
 

229
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,230
why is that 7 and
seven is kind of odd yeah so okay

230
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
seven is kind of odd yeah so okay
 

231
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,590
seven is kind of odd yeah so okay
so how about three

232
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
so how about three
 

233
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,710
so how about three
and nine why are you doing two right now

234
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
and nine why are you doing two right now
 

235
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,629
and nine why are you doing two right now
i'm just checking three and nine is that

236
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
i'm just checking three and nine is that
 

237
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,629
i'm just checking three and nine is that
okay three numbers also

238
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
okay three numbers also
 

239
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,230
okay three numbers also
hey and nine numbers of b you sure yeah

240
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
hey and nine numbers of b you sure yeah
 

241
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,430
hey and nine numbers of b you sure yeah
yeah okay

242
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
yeah okay
 

243
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,390
yeah okay
okay so yeah that's okay so what were

244
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
okay so yeah that's okay so what were
 

245
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,749
okay so yeah that's okay so what were
you thinking about

246
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
you thinking about
 

247

yeah what are we how are you checking
 

255
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,189
yeah what are we how are you checking
with

256
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
with
 

257
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,390
with
yes or no how are you chicken with three

258
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
yes or no how are you chicken with three
 

259
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,110
yes or no how are you chicken with three
nice oh

260
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
nice oh
 

261
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,309
nice oh
okay this is not okay

262
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
okay this is not okay
 

263
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,430
okay this is not okay
look one one one and then there will be

264
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
look one one one and then there will be
 

265
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,469
look one one one and then there will be
two two two two two two

266
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
two two two two two two
 

267
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,870
two two two two two two
four six a

268
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
four six a
 

269
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,550
four six a
nine okay so you can group with one two

270
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
nine okay so you can group with one two
 

271
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,070
nine okay so you can group with one two
three four yeah yeah okay it's basically

272
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
three four yeah yeah okay it's basically
 

273
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:08,469
three four yeah yeah okay it's basically
like you're just taking yeah

274
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479

 

275
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,670

another but if their prime number

276
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
another but if their prime number
 

277
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,950
another but if their prime number
in one is definitely not

278
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
in one is definitely not
 

279
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,909
in one is definitely not
prime number yeah if there's only one

280
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
prime number yeah if there's only one
 

281
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,270
prime number yeah if there's only one
two

282
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
two
 

283
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,870
two
yeah okay so if one two

284
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880

 

285
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,430

what um two is prime number one two is

286
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
what um two is prime number one two is
 

287
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,870
what um two is prime number one two is
that okay

288
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
that okay
 

289
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,990
that okay
yeah are you sure one two

290
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
yeah are you sure one two
 

291
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,270
yeah are you sure one two
two that's very obvious not right okay

292
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
two that's very obvious not right okay
 

293
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,990
two that's very obvious not right okay
so what what um

294
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
so what what um
 

295
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,309
so what what um
times table it may be three times table

296
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
times table it may be three times table
 

297
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,830
times table it may be three times table
look this is three times table

298
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
look this is three times table
 

299
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,830
look this is three times table
yeah it may be four times four five

300
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
yeah it may be four times four five
 

301
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,110
yeah it may be four times four five
times table so

302
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
times table so
 

303
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,830
times table so
i didn't say two times okay okay so okay

304
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
i didn't say two times okay okay so okay
 

305
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,469
i didn't say two times okay okay so okay
so what's

306
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
so what's
 

307
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,629
so what's
what's the thing we are looking um

308
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
what's the thing we are looking um
 

309
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,430
what's the thing we are looking um
trying out the smallest number smallest

310
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
trying out the smallest number smallest
 

311
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,150
trying out the smallest number smallest
number yeah okay it's not this number

312
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
number yeah okay it's not this number
 

313
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,070
number yeah okay it's not this number
and we want to check if they are

314
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
and we want to check if they are
 

315
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,909
and we want to check if they are
multiple yeah

316
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
multiple yeah
 

317
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,110
multiple yeah
okay so y four and six is okay come on

318
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
okay so y four and six is okay come on
 

319
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,990
okay so y four and six is okay come on
why four is six

320
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
why four is six
 

321
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,430
why four is six
is okay oh because they're both

322
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
is okay oh because they're both
 

323
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,350
is okay oh because they're both
even numbers and they're both

324
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
even numbers and they're both
 

325
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,790
even numbers and they're both
tables that's the correct they're in

326
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
tables that's the correct they're in
 

327
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,350
tables that's the correct they're in
both two times saver so two

328
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
both two times saver so two
 

329
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,350
both two times saver so two
of two what is two of these four and six

330
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
of two what is two of these four and six
 

331
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,630
of two what is two of these four and six
what's two six

332
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
what's two six
 

333
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,149
what's two six
minus four and also they

334
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
minus four and also they
 

335
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,389
minus four and also they
they are both in four two time table

336
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
they are both in four two time table
 

337
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,269
they are both in four two time table
yeah

338
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
yeah
 

339
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,709
yeah
and this is the biggest in

340
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
and this is the biggest in
 

341
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,790
and this is the biggest in
two times as well yeah so what do we

342
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
two times as well yeah so what do we
 

343
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,550
two times as well yeah so what do we
call it greatest

344
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
call it greatest
 

345
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,949
call it greatest
weight is common divider yeah this is

346
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
weight is common divider yeah this is
 

347
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,150
weight is common divider yeah this is
common divisor

348
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
common divisor
 

349
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,430

divisor of all the numbers frequency and

358
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
divisor of all the numbers frequency and
 

359
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,790
divisor of all the numbers frequency and
check if they are bigger

360
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
check if they are bigger
 

361
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,470
check if they are bigger
if the grade is common divisor of all

362
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
if the grade is common divisor of all
 

363
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,470
if the grade is common divisor of all
numbers yeah we can do the greatest

364
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
numbers yeah we can do the greatest
 

365
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,230
numbers yeah we can do the greatest
common divides of all numbers how how do

366
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
common divides of all numbers how how do
 

367
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,949
common divides of all numbers how how do
we do this

368
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
we do this
 

369
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,990
we do this
look we can we can just do this uh the

370
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
look we can we can just do this uh the
 

371
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,710
look we can we can just do this uh the
answer

372
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
answer
 

373
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,710
answer
equals the first number okay first

374
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
equals the first number okay first
 

375
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,230
equals the first number okay first
number so let's say this is

376
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
number so let's say this is
 

377
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,550
number so let's say this is
a a0 and now we can just do this for i

378
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
a a0 and now we can just do this for i
 

379
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,070
a a0 and now we can just do this for i
in a

380
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080

 

381
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,750

answer equals greatest common divisor of

382
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
answer equals greatest common divisor of
 

383
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,350
answer equals greatest common divisor of
answer and i right and then let's regret

384
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
answer and i right and then let's regret
 

385
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,389
answer and i right and then let's regret
its common device of

386
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
its common device of
 

387
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,710
its common device of
all the numbers in the array right and

388
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
all the numbers in the array right and
 

389
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,750
all the numbers in the array right and
it has to be

390
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
it has to be
 

391
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,150
it has to be
bigger than one then it's yes otherwise

392
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
bigger than one then it's yes otherwise
 

393
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,030
bigger than one then it's yes otherwise
it's not

394
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
it's not
 

395
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,110
it's not
right let's check this one and two

396
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
right let's check this one and two
 

397
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,470
right let's check this one and two
greatest common divisor

398
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
greatest common divisor
 

399
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,790
greatest common divisor
is one so that's not okay this one

400
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
is one so that's not okay this one
 

401
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,790
is one so that's not okay this one
two and seven what is common divisor is

402
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
two and seven what is common divisor is
 

403
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,430
two and seven what is common divisor is
what

404
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440

 

405
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,949

one one is not okay yeah one one

406
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
one one is not okay yeah one one
 

407
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,110
one one is not okay yeah one one
and any other number greatest common

408
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
and any other number greatest common
 

409
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,710
and any other number greatest common
divisor is one right

410
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
divisor is one right
 

411
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,670
divisor is one right
got it exactly

412
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
got it exactly
 

413
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,790
got it exactly
prime numbers except no it would be

414
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
prime numbers except no it would be
 

415
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,470
prime numbers except no it would be
multiple it would be still okay

416
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
multiple it would be still okay
 

417
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,750
multiple it would be still okay
if i give you a number 13 and

418
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
if i give you a number 13 and
 

419
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,870
if i give you a number 13 and
13 is a prime number right and how about

420
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
13 is a prime number right and how about
 

421
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,630
13 is a prime number right and how about
26 13 and 26

422
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
26 13 and 26
 

423
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,990
26 13 and 26
is still okay right because 13 and 26

424
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,000
is still okay right because 13 and 26
 

425
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,550
is still okay right because 13 and 26
greatest common divisor is 13.

426
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
greatest common divisor is 13.
 

427
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,910
greatest common divisor is 13.
you see yeah so we're just checking

428
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
you see yeah so we're just checking
 

429
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:42,310
you see yeah so we're just checking
the code the two numbers

430
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320

 

431
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:58,230

so first of all we wanted to what

432
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240

 

433
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,590

let's say the first number which is what

434
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
let's say the first number which is what
 

435
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,069
let's say the first number which is what
okay and we want to we want to know the

436
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
okay and we want to we want to know the
 

437
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,829
okay and we want to we want to know the
frequency yeah

438
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
frequency yeah
 

439
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,269
frequency yeah
so frequency will be let's say n

440
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
so frequency will be let's say n
 

441
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,750
so frequency will be let's say n
equals c dot values we just need to do

442
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:13,760
equals c dot values we just need to do
 

443
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,790
equals c dot values we just need to do
normal values yeah

444
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
normal values yeah
 

445
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,750
normal values yeah
values and we'll convert it to a list

446
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
values and we'll convert it to a list
 

447
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,150
values and we'll convert it to a list
these

448
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
these
 

449
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,710
these
seed of values all right this is n and

450
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
seed of values all right this is n and
 

451
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,590
seed of values all right this is n and
then we're going to do this a equals

452
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
then we're going to do this a equals
 

453
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,430
then we're going to do this a equals
and 0 for

454
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
and 0 for
 

455
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,670
and 0 for
i in n right

456
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
i in n right
 

457
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,470
i in n right
a equals what can you tell me a equals

458
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
a equals what can you tell me a equals
 

459
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,269
a equals what can you tell me a equals
one

460
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279

 

461
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,030

and return a what another

462
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
and return a what another
 

463
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,230
and return a what another
what are we doing here what's the

464
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
what are we doing here what's the
 

465
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,420
what are we doing here what's the
function

466
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:46,430
function
 

467
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,190
function
[Music]

468
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200

 

469
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,230

and what's this what's two values what

470
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
and what's this what's two values what
 

471
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,670
and what's this what's two values what
a and b a with s there's no b

472
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
a and b a with s there's no b
 

473
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,069
a and b a with s there's no b
where a and y we're looking all the

474
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
where a and y we're looking all the
 

475
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,470
where a and y we're looking all the
numbers in n which is the value

476
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
numbers in n which is the value
 

477
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,670
numbers in n which is the value
so what's that

478
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680

 

479
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,870

what's this n is the values and i what's

480
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
what's this n is the values and i what's
 

481
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,829
what's this n is the values and i what's
that

482
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
that
 

483
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,710
that
i yeah come on all right okay so written

484
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
i yeah come on all right okay so written
 

485
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,350
i yeah come on all right okay so written
a

486
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
a
 

487
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,389
a
what a

488
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399

 

489
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,350

that's one a one well talking about the

490
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
that's one a one well talking about the
 

491
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,990
that's one a one well talking about the
greatest common divisor we want to be

492
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
greatest common divisor we want to be
 

493
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,110
greatest common divisor we want to be
bigger bigger than once okay

494
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
bigger bigger than once okay
 

495
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,590
bigger bigger than once okay
okay so let's say uh the quantity is

496
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
okay so let's say uh the quantity is
 

497
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,350
okay so let's say uh the quantity is
common divisor do you still remember

498
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
common divisor do you still remember
 

499
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,910
common divisor do you still remember
define this is built in but we will

500
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
define this is built in but we will
 

501
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,230
define this is built in but we will
review it what is common devices a and b

502
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
review it what is common devices a and b
 

503
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,790
review it what is common devices a and b
how how is implementing it

504
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800

 

505
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,150

21 21 and 14

506
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
21 21 and 14
 

507
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,949
21 21 and 14
what's the greatest common divisor seven

508
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
what's the greatest common divisor seven
 

509
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,230
what's the greatest common divisor seven
how do we do this

510
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
how do we do this
 

511
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,590
how do we do this
a and b okay so look

512
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
a and b okay so look
 

513
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,829
a and b okay so look
why are b is not is bigger than zero

514
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
why are b is not is bigger than zero
 

515
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,509
why are b is not is bigger than zero
a b equals b a modulus b

516
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
a b equals b a modulus b
 

517
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,949
a b equals b a modulus b
and return what we say one

518
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959
and return what we say one
 

519
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,990
and return what we say one
a or b a yeah

520
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
a or b a yeah
 

521
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,870
a or b a yeah
so why is that look a b y b is not

522
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
so why is that look a b y b is not
 

523
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,910
so why is that look a b y b is not
yellow

524
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
yellow
 

525
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,350
yellow
a equals b b equals

526
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
a equals b b equals
 

527
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,829
a equals b b equals
a is supposed to be the biggest look

528
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
a is supposed to be the biggest look
 

529
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,629
a is supposed to be the biggest look
that's okay

530
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
that's okay
 

531
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,829
that's okay
a equals b yeah a will become b

532
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
a equals b yeah a will become b
 

533
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,389
a equals b yeah a will become b
and b will become a 21 modulus 14

534
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
and b will become a 21 modulus 14
 

535
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,590
and b will become a 21 modulus 14
remember what 21 divided by 14

536
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
remember what 21 divided by 14
 

537
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,910
remember what 21 divided by 14
remain what compounds seven okay now

538
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
remain what compounds seven okay now
 

539
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,350
remain what compounds seven okay now
b is not yellow a a becomes b

540
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
b is not yellow a a becomes b
 

541
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,269
b is not yellow a a becomes b
okay so seven right here fourteen

542
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
okay so seven right here fourteen
 

543
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,110
okay so seven right here fourteen
divided by seven how many left

544
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120

 

545
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,590

remainder twenty divided by seven 14

546
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
remainder twenty divided by seven 14
 

547
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,829
remainder twenty divided by seven 14
divided by seven

548
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
divided by seven
 

549
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,790
divided by seven
zero zero okay so p is yellow so this is

550
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
zero zero okay so p is yellow so this is
 

551
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,829
zero zero okay so p is yellow so this is
like within a

552
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
like within a
 

553
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,710
like within a
so greatest common divisor a right

554
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
so greatest common divisor a right
 

555
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,670
