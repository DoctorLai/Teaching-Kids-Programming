1
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,000
okay

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,400
so let's say you know we you have

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,720
yeah well flight flight airplane yeah

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,039
the fire item the tickets

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,279
so basically if i say a piece of you

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,160
eric yeah yeah you have a bunch of

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,039
tickets uh first phone so you want to go

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,160
to somewhere australia right yeah

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,640
city yeah australia so you go to london

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,559
london heathrow airport yeah

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,480
london history expo

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,040
and then you go to

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,040
uh beijing yeah china

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,000
and then from beijing you probably go to

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,760
australia senior sydney is the capital

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,320
okay

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,960
so look you have you need two tickets

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,640
one ticket london to basin and then that

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,800
that's the connecting flight so from

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
beijing you can take another airplane to

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,960
friday

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,800
what are we where i am like just going

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,520
to capital cities

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,159
i mean i'm just giving an example okay

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,040
so london here for example like so you

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,320
need two tickets right so if they are

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,560
from sydney

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,560
where else can you go from sydney new

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,960
zealand for example i don't know what's

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,000
the capital of new zealand okay

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,280
new zealand is part of australia

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,960
no

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,680
it's not

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,680
it's a different country

35
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,400
[Music]

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,280
to

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,399
to beijing

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,240
and i have sydney

39
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:53,200
sydney to new zealand okay new zealand

40
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,759
four two one two three three five

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,680
okay so if i

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,920
okay look this is a three flies three

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,000
tickets three tickets okay so i'm going

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,479
to erase this speed so can you tell me

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,040
which which is the first city you visit

46
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,680
i mean which is the

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
for start place

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,879
tickets because look the tickets may be

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
shuffled

50
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,080
so what's the what how do we find out

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,760
how does this computer find out so the

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,640
thing is

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,120
so

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,480
so you find the

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,280
so

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,000
so

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,520
all you need to do you find the

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,640
the there are six uh uh places yeah yeah

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,239
some duplicates you find for one

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,319
the two that that are only are unique

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,200
from the others so

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,280
and

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,200
and this one is from the left so that

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,040
means you should start first and this

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,280
one is from the right side exactly

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,599
that's very good point yeah yeah you

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
know what i'm talking about yeah

68
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,879
there are three tickets let's shuffle so

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,120
we want to find out the first place

70
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,920
right let's start the the strong start

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
yeah

72
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,800
yeah

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,120
and then we want to find out you know a

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,760
bunch of flies and unless we go go to

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
the destination at destination so you're

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,840
saying that all these in the middle of

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,040
cities in the middle will be duplicated

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,560
right yeah yeah and then only the start

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,840
and destination and from the left-hand

80
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,599
side is london

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,239
this is the destination

82
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,280
very good point very good australian

83
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,319
yeah

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,599
okay

85
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,000
okay so look yeah yeah so what

86
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,400
come on listen to me yeah

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,680
yeah you're right so this is kind of a

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,920
simple graph which means that no let's

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,239
let's assume that no cities

90
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,080
will be visited twice

91
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,879
what does it mean it implies that

92
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,920
there's there will be no cycle in the in

93
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,799
in the graph right okay so look a to the

94
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,720
b

95
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,400
uh c to the a

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,040
uh okay another one okay a to the c

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,040
no no no not a b okay a to the b c to

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,599
the a b to the c

99
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,599
okay and

100
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,680
uh c to the a c to the

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,920
d to the c

102
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,360
uh b c a

103
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,360
okay so there might be a cycle

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,879
okay uh that'll probably take about 30

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,280
hours yeah yeah good look leave this

106
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,799
there is a cycle here look yeah

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,639
look at me look

108
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,479
a to the b

109
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
a to the b

110
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,880
b to the c

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,520
c to the a this is a cycle yeah and how

112
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,720
about look if i'm not saying b to c i'm

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,759
saying that uh b to the d

114
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,639
okay

115
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,120
and c e to the c okay can you find out

116
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,600
which one is the star place

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,160
which one is the star place

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,360
which one is the destination here a to

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,000
the b c to the a b to the d e to the c

120
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,800
which place which we are visiting first

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,880
come on

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,160
uh we need you to see

123
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,360
which place is the star which place this

124
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,720
is the star yeah which place is the

125
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,000
destination

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,000
to the a a to the b

127
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,400
okay so that's like what you said okay

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,919
we if we have a duplicate

129
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,919
that's that's something in the middle

130
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,240
right so that's a graph okay so e on the

131
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,080
left hand side is the sound d is on the

132
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,919
right hand side is the destination

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,560
this is a simple bar actually this is

134
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,199
just a part yeah and we love

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,199
the cycle so if we find the first one

136
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,880
then we can just follow it right we can

137
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
just follow it follow the photo until we

138
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,919
get to the end all right yeah okay so

139
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,160
that would be that a little bit of task

140
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,880
today okay so we remember the graph if

141
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,720
we have an edge pointing up pointing in

142
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,520
the the in degree

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,919
the indegree of the node c b

144
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,600
plus one right so if the edge coming in

145
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,360
that will be the in degree and that will

146
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,080
be if the edge going out that will be

147
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,919
our degree right you get it so this

148
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,800
finding the start of the

149
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,520
graph is basically the same as

150
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,600
the integral of a star is what

151
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,520
the integral of the star

152
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,800
the in degree of the star is

153
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,199
how many edges coming to the star

154
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,919
going to the star zero oh certain

155
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,360
degrees zero exactly like that okay so

156
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,360
we can do this and

157
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,600
okay i'm going to write this okay so it

158
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,560
should be very easy so we are given this

159
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,560
that of uh the structure the fry tickets

160
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,720
and we want to find out that the

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,880
the route okay so which ticket we take

162
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,240
first we're connecting fries and then we

163
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,840
find out the destination ryan

164
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,360
defy okay let's say the

165
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,199
flight

166
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,479
and that will be the ticket okay let's

167
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,919
say flights okay right

168
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,360
yeah

169
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,520
right okay it's not right yeah if

170
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,680
we check these special cases if the

171
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,840
given input is a empty list then we just

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,160
return empty yeah because we can't let's

173
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,120
not take it we just we cannot empty this

174
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,960
okay now we put this answer here answer

175
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,840
at the beginning we have uh empty this

176
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,520
this is the this is the uh

177
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,599
the answer yeah we're going to return

178
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,240
written here yeah written somewhere and

179
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,479
we can answer okay

180
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
now we want to put down the flight

181
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,720
flight will be given as you know the

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,160
string like a to the b

183
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
a eight

184
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,120
a uh

185
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,199
a b

186
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,960
so you'll be given as a

187
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,880
an array of uh

188
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,319
an array of tickets yeah it would be

189
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,880
something like that yeah b to the c

190
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,280
this will be a rate of the flight ap

191
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,240
okay so let's put it in the graph yeah

192
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,840
graph

193
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,080
graph

194
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,080
graph is the edges and remember what's

195
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,960
graph graph the collection data

196
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,680
structure with the collection of uh

197
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,479
vertex and edges yeah vertex vertices

198
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,840
here

199
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,000
vertex is the node it's like the the

200
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,360
cities the edges are the connecting

201
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,319
flight okay

202
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,039
so now g will be equal to let's say we

203
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,560
can use this stationary additionally

204
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,479
a to a comma b

205
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,599
for

206
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,720
a b in flight okay we can do this one

207
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,319
single line

208
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
right all right

209
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,039
right

210
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,440
look at it ap

211
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,160
so this is the dictionary yeah look

212
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,560
decently a b a to the b what's a what's

213
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,120
b defined here a and b is in the place

214
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,759
so basically this is saying that uh we

215
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,000
are transforming the these

216
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,880
data structure a list of the tickets

217
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,880
into a graph which is a to the b so that

218
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,519
will be

219
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,519
the keys will be from city the values

220
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,640
will be two city okay so it's a flight

221
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,000
okay and now we want to find out

222
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,000
let's say we want to find out the star

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,240
city as you said we want to find the in

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,279
degree okay that's one easy way let's

225
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,200
please

226
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,279
first of all let's please state

227
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,000
the dictionary decision we can we can

228
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,080
take these flights we can take these and

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,640
put it into a dictionary we can convert

230
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,920
the list into a dictionary so the data

231
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,600
of keys

232
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,720
will be a b

233
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,360
data values will be bc okay

234
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,240
so this is the steps uh a way of doing

235
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,399
that look let's let's put another one c

236
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,720
to d

237
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,720
here

238
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,360
yeah yeah at least that's three tickets

239
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,680
a to the b b to the c c to d this is

240
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,000
easy okay yeah

241
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,440
okay so if we convert it to data that

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,800
data will converge theta to be a

243
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,600
to b

244
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,959
b

245
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,360
to c

246
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:47,120
c to d so this is the keys

247
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,680
these values so now look if we we we

248
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,120
creating a set of these abc right so

249
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,240
look set of keys will be a

250
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,959
b

251
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,440
c

252
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,200
set of values so b b c d right so b c

253
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,800
d okay look

254
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,839
to set set of keys will be abc

255
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,120
set of the values will be bcd yeah look

256
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,399
with

257
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,920
data

258
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,320
is a dictionary

259
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,720
we're taking this flight of tickets a b

260
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,440
c abc will be q

261
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,680
and bcd will be the values so the keys

262
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,320
will be abc here

263
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,279
values will be bcd i put it in the set

264
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,480
yeah so if i doing this

265
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,959
difference

266
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,720
set a minus set b will be the elements

267
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,120
like in first set

268
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,200
not existing in the second set okay so

269
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,800
what's what's that look if i'm saying

270
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,640
this this this first circle is a right

271
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,360
okay that's a smaller a

272
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,680
these will be a equals

273
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,160
a b c

274
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,320
and b equals

275
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,000
b c d okay

276
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,360
so can you tell me what's a minus b

277
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,040
a minus b equals

278
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,240
a minus c

279
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,120
equals

280
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,440
a

281
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,839
equals a what does it mean it means that

282
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,120
the elements that exists in a not

283
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,360
existing b okay how about b minus a

284
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,000
3

285
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,160
the opposite it's in here but not in

286
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,760
here which one

287
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,000
a minus b

288
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,920
a minus b will be a

289
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,519
actually this is a okay

290
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,720
okay and then b minus a will be what

291
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,200
which element is b

292
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,920
okay yeah that's the difference a minus

293
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,720
b is the same as a dot difference b yeah

294
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,279
this is the same a minus b if we set is

295
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,920
equal to a dot difference

296
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,880
difference b meaning that the elements

297
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,079
it is in set a but do not exist in set b

298
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,920
okay so now if we do this

299
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,160
if we do this a minus b

300
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,519
then that would be let's start right

301
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,480
that'll be the star which is the a right

302
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,279
so

303
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,160
so we can just do this uh the set let's

304
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,320
say

305
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,680
uh s equals

306
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,959
set

307
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,600
data

308
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,320
set data is the same as the data of keys

309
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,839
okay set data keys

310
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,079
minus set data values

311
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,800
and now let's should give us

312
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,279
a set with only one element and we can

313
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,880
convert them a set of one on element to

314
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,040
a star we can do this next function yeah

315
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,120
remember what's next function next one

316
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,959
it takes an iterator so let's convert

317
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,720
this set into iterator which which

318
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,560
first of all we convert the set to the

319
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,480
iterator and then we can use the next

320
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,399
function to retrieve the first one the

321
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,560
next one which is the star because it

322
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,600
only has one element right another way

323
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,800
we can do this the empty join we can

324
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,600
join s this is uh also okay right

325
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,680
because look s is a set then we can join

326
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,839
it and you also give us a

327
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,600
let's start okay both are okay

328
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,959
and then we we have this star then we

329
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,519
can do this

330
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,839
answer first of all answer the opinion

331
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,760
so probably we can

332
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,560
instead of putting here we can just say

333
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,040
answer put it because we can directly

334
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,279
put a star at the beginning

335
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,839
and then wire

336
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,200
where a

337
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:27,760
star in the in in the ticket then we do

338
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,760
this what we can do this answer

339
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,440
answer actually we need to go for next

340
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,880
so star equals

341
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,480
star equals g

342
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,720
[Music]

343
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,720
star okay we find the next ticket fg

344
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,760
this is the graph yeah we find the next

345
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,680
one

346
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,800
and then we can answer the append

347
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,800
apparent star okay

348
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,040
all right

349
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,040
return answer

350
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,560
g

351
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,399
what's g

352
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
graph class

353
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,680
what does it contain what does this

354
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,360
contain

355
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,279
uh it contains

356
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,000
a b a b b g c c d yeah it would be

357
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,839
traditionally a to the b so u b

358
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,199
because it's a single line yeah a to the

359
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,839
p u so uh we just uh

360
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,839
the the values will be just a single

361
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,680
value yeah normally

362
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,160
normally if we use this kind of

363
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,160
dictionary to represent the graph the

364
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,320
keys will be the note the value will be

365
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,320
a list of notes but in this case we only

366
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,000
have one note right because it's a

367
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,079
single way

368
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,480
we're traveling just one way yeah and

369
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,800
there's no cycle we we are not traveling

370
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,760
there's no such cases if you go a to the

371
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,560
b and a to the c okay this doesn't exist

372
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,880
yeah

373
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,399
so a from one node there will be only

374
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,720
one node

375
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,120
connect so in this case there will be

376
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,600
only one all degree

377
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,959
right from a there will be only one out

378
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,199
degree

379
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,079
there's no such cases the article will

380
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,839
be more than one okay because if we in

381
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,279
more modern y doesn't make sense you

382
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,959
will come from a

383
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,920
which way you're going

384
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,000
right

385
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,560
there's no right

386
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,279
no you can't go both so you go a or you

387
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,240
go go b then there's no c or you go c

388
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,040
there's no b so so we only we only have

389
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,079
one value here which is the

390
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,199
the destination of latitude okay a to

391
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,639
the b and then that's b to the c

392
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,560
and then here will be c to the b okay

393
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,959
additionally g

394
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,680
this is a nice way to construct a

395
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,959
dictionary a graph dictionary

396
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:46,000
from a list of tickets right

397
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,600
data dictionary as we talked uh

398
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,199
we're converting

399
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,199
the flies into the data

400
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,360
into the data so actually obviously we

401
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,600
don't need this right because let's look

402
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,199
at this data this is the same right here

403
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,279
right all right

404
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,639
so probably we don't need it right

405
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,959
this is the same thing these two are the

406
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,240
same thing okay i just small area

407
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,759
right g

408
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,199
so we just don't we we we just do this g

409
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,320
equals left

410
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,399
right yeah it's the same thing is it

411
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,880
should be the same thing okay

412
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,320
so g dot keys

413
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,160
g the values and

414
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,240
and then

415
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,560
yeah it should be all right okay

416
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,199
then the time complexity that end ticket

417
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,680
will be lan because each each city will

418
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,720
be visited only once okay

419
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,600
the space complexity o o n we're using

420
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,120
that dictionary to store a graph

421
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,639
right

422
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,800
to store a graph

423
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,800
okay that's it that's it for today bye

424
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,519
you
