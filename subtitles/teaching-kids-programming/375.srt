1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,859
[Music]

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,240
so we give it a string like a a b a b

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,240
okay

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,199
if we want to split you know split split

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,279
the string into two non empty parts

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,359
straight into two a

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,480
b a non empty how many ways can we do it

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,480
if we can

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,200
split the string into two parts but both

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,559
needs to be non-empty how many ways are

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,480
there

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,960
if the string has like these five

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,680
characters how many ways how many

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,280
how many ways can we split the string

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,200
into two non-empty parts two

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,440
two yeah two three or two two

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,960
one two

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,559
okay can you release the the a and abba

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,559
abba abba uh

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,040
how many characters one two three four

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
five let's end how many ways can we

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,479
split it

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,360
so it's n minus one yeah because we want

24
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,040
the long empty antibody okay okay

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,240
okay so above these four therefore yeah

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,119
how many

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,680
which two you know if we split into two

28
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,720
and each part has the same number of

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,399
distinct characters same distinct what

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,479
does that mean

31
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,079
this thing this thing what's this thing

32
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,520
unique yeah

33
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,520
characters we need

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,200
so look here we only have a here we have

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,119
a b right so look here has a this is a b

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,640
it's not the same

37
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,759
here a a

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,799
here a b here a here a b not the same

39
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,160
yeah a b a b look here has two a one b

40
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,280
this is one a one b but both have one

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,680
both have letters a and b so here

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,959
we count it and here

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,360
no right

44
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,560
yeah this is a and b here is b doesn't

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,319
have a

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,680
okay so we we want to check

47
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,599
and add is correct okay so look what's

48
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,000
what's the purpose here is we want to

49
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,800
count how many how many ways we can

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,800
split into the there's only one into two

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
distinct characters

52
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,990
right some distinct characters

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,020
any idea how we can do it any idea how

54
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,020
[Music]

55
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,200
how many ways can we can split into look

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,080
we can we said n minus one well we can

57
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,360
proof of it right we can just pull from

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
each

59
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,440
and then

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,640
and then and and then and then um how do

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,360
we check if both have intersect

62
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,680
in a set and what particularly in

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,959
yeah settle for the idea and another way

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
with

65
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,599
what kind of data structure are we using

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
to count

67
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,720
counter yeah we can use the counter and

68
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,519
we check the keys

69
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,519
right

70
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,080
we check the length of the keys if it's

71
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,799
equal right yeah okay so let's quickly

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,440
write this okay and then you know what

73
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,280
by implementing this we know the problem

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
better okay okay

75
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,599
please

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
define okay let's say just uh split

77
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,159
uh

78
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,319
split

79
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,920
into two three two okay

80
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,239
uh s

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,239
so first of all if the string is empty

82
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,439
we just return zero yeah because there's

83
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,959
no way

84
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,000
to

85
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,720
spread into two okay now let's let's

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
implement it let's let's do this for i

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,000
in range

88
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,040
length

89
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,159
s

90
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,360
okay

91
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,479
and then i look here s is here now i

92
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,720
just need to iterate this is i is zero

93
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,560
so i need to counter

94
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,520
i need to look here this part is s

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,560
i plus one okay and then

96
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,240
the right most bit the we split into the

97
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,000
string into two parts yeah the left

98
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,919
fifth is this yeah up to i including i

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,639
right the right bit is start from i

100
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,520
plus one to the end right

101
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,520
okay so let's say c1 equals counter yeah

102
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,800
we want to count

103
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,160
s up to i plus one

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,919
and c two is we want to call the the the

105
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,479
string on the right right so it's

106
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,479
counter

107
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,800
s i plus 1 to the n right

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,039
so how do we check if both parts have

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
the same number of characters uh you

110
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,680
know

111
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,039
distinct characters

112
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,120
we check the

113
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,720
what what do we check what counter what

114
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,919
does the counter have it's the

115
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,639
accountant

116
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,680
so what's the key of the counter

117
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,919
it's like it it's like how many times

118
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,240
each one appears let's try it yeah so

119
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,240
the keys are the distinct characters the

120
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,759
values are the number they appear right

121
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,919
so we want to check the keys or the

122
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,479
values of the c1 and c2 so how do we

123
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,800
compare it with c1 or c2

124
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,800
if

125
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,800
is what

126
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,919
c1 what's this what's how many

127
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,320
characters in c1

128
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,039
what how do we use it it's the same as

129
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,280
the

130
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,600
yeah yeah so it's length the key

131
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,080
length c1 this is the number of keys

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,400
which is the number of characters equals

133
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,479
the length of c2

134
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,800
all right and then we implement answer e

135
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,720
plus equal one and we need to initialize

136
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,840
the answer equals zero and return

137
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,319
another one yeah okay yeah

138
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,720
make sense look we go through the eye

139
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,039
and then each eye we split into two

140
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,560
halves and we use the counter right the

141
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,080
counter we do we count the stop the the

142
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
the string on the left and the string on

143
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,960
the right the partition you have to

144
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,199
partition

145
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,160
and then if the keys this is the key the

146
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,759
same number of the distinct characters

147
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,840
yeah we don't compare with the values

148
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,199
because values could be different right

149
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,120
yeah aab and aba

150
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,600
yeah that

151
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,319
aab which is

152
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,280
a2 b1 right and abb which will be

153
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,759
a1 b2 right look

154
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,160
but then c1 and c2 both

155
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,000
return two so these two equal right

156
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,919
answer equal one plus equal one right

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
make sense yeah we don't compare with

158
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,720
the values we only compare with the key

159
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,599
the length c1 and c2

160
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,720
so that does that mean you only contain

161
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,039
a's and b's

162
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,120
because because he said

163
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,919
we returned too

164
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,319
okay yeah that's very good point okay so

165
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,400
let me rephrase this bit a little bit if

166
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,560
the string only contains two a and b

167
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,880
okay and how about if we don't contain

168
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,280
it if not then we have we can change

169
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,160
this to one if we want to compare the a

170
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,880
and b are also equal right yeah

171
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,880
yeah so then we can say what if set

172
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,919
c1

173
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,199
the keys okay so if c1 the keys yeah c1

174
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,199
the keys is the

175
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,599
yeah a b right and equal

176
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,840
set c two dot b yeah

177
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,840
yeah

178
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,280
okay and then answer plus one okay make

179
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,680
sense yeah yeah okay okay that's a very

180
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,160
good point because if we use the length

181
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,840
what could happen if a and b at least

182
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,919
could be c and d they're different right

183
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,199
but then they're also two

184
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,199
makes sense

185
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,940
okay let's look at a very good one okay

186
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,319
what's the time from juxtaposition

187
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,280
[Music]

188
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,199
this is quite tricky look here and

189
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,319
where that one squared because counter

190
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,199
we have to do this and there's n here

191
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,240
and then let's here and the o n square

192
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
stays complexity

193
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,639
what's the space format

194
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,639
oh n

195
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,159
we can do it uh we can do it faster yeah

196
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,880
we can do it faster why is that look

197
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,039
every time by just right

198
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,360
with your big brain

199
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,240
okay so now look

200
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,040
i'm saying look look here this this is

201
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,160
c1 and this is c2

202
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,160
if i move the partition one character to

203
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,480
the right what happened

204
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,000
if i move this i position one position

205
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,839
to the right what happened if this

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,440
character is s i

207
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,240
do it how do we update c1 and c2

208
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
yeah

209
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,279
currently i'm seeing i hear the left is

210
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,760
c1 the right is c2 yeah

211
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,000
okay so what happens if i move the i one

212
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,399
position one character to the right

213
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
so what do i need to do with the ci plus

214
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,000
one

215
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,399
ci needs to include this letter yeah

216
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,200
but c2 needs to

217
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,360
delete it well done right so in

218
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,959
this one is slow why is that

219
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,640
because every time i need to count it

220
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,600
again again again yeah i need to

221
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,640
dynamically counting the two parts this

222
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,959
takes a long time but look i know i

223
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,560
every time move one character i can

224
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,720
update it a one time i can update c2 a

225
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,120
one time okay right

226
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,880
yeah so that'll be a faster right at

227
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,200
least will be fast okay

228
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,720
so let's do this

229
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,120
you're not gonna write the whole thing

230
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,000
just half of it

231
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,920
that's

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,880
about um

233
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,240
okay so in now i need to declare the c1

234
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,800
and c2 outside c1 is on the left counter

235
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,440
so you'll be empty so what happened to

236
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:12,640
the c2 c2 will be counter bar instead of

237
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,120
instead of looks at the beginning c1 is

238
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,800
nothing here yeah nothing c2 is the

239
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,640
whole string so what parameters do i

240
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,079
give it to string s s yes s yeah yeah

241
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,480
this is c

242
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,440
c two here okay and then i just need to

243
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,800
go for i in range by the way we no don't

244
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,480
need to

245
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,959
in the previous one we don't need to go

246
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,120
through the end we need to go through

247
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,399
tier n minus one right because they are

248
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,680
non-empty so in range here

249
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,680
length

250
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,120
s right we need to we can minus one

251
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,040
right because there's no

252
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,079
there's no point of checking

253
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,360
yeah there's no point of checking

254
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,360
here the entire path because if both

255
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,680
is non-empty okay so we can minus one

256
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,320
here all right yeah

257
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,920
now look c1 and c2 okay

258
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,680
now c1 needs to include a letter f here

259
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,079
so c one

260
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,200
s i

261
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:12,000
y and p something okay plus equal one

262
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
okay now c two needs to be moving yeah

263
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
yeah

264
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
c2

265
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,120
s i

266
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,519
minus equal one okay yeah

267
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
but when we minus equal one it might it

268
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,920
might reduce to zl all right when it

269
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,200
reduces zero what we need to get rid of

270
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,000
it right look if if even counter is a

271
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,880
equals one right if after this if c2 is

272
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,760
this one a

273
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,839
a c2 a minus one will be equal to zero

274
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,240
right yeah

275
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,160
so we need to remove this beta again so

276
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,920
we just say c2

277
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,240
as i

278
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,680
equal equal 0 then

279
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,079
we did it okay did it fts stand for did

280
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,839
it did it c2

281
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,040
s

282
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,600
i yeah

283
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,480
and then we check if c1

284
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,040
equal or equal to c2

285
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,079
yeah uh actually is we need to compare

286
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,760
the

287
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,360
the keys

288
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,560
this is the same yeah we need to compare

289
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,399
the keys only yeah c1 dot keys

290
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,680
yeah we won't compare to the keys the

291
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:21,040
value doesn't matter equals

292
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,600
i will put it in a set yeah set

293
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,160
set doesn't compare with the order if

294
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,399
the set c one and equals set c2 keys

295
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,639
if it's equal then we do the answer plus

296
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,639
equal one right and then we can answer

297
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,480
make sense yeah answer equals zero

298
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,140
okay

299
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,800
yeah

300
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,320
[Music]

301
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,399
and

302
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,120
here look

303
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,240
i i is the partition of

304
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,320
index

305
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,800
and that partition the index moving from

306
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,760
left to right and every time i need to

307
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,720
include

308
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,519
s i character to c1 counter

309
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,959
but i have to remove it from c2 right

310
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,680
yeah yeah

311
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,079
and actually remove the c2 completely

312
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,079
look if it is two that's right i remove

313
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,440
one but when this reaches zero i need to

314
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,519
get rid of this

315
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,839
right because if not

316
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,000
set c one dot keys a will be still

317
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,959
included here right we don't want to

318
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,800
include a key with the appearance yellow

319
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,399
because when it reaches zero it means

320
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,399
that there is no

321
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,399
such character in the set uh in a in a

322
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,200
in the current window okay so there are

323
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,920
two windows left and right c1 c2

324
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,519
and if the set if it's equal then we and

325
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,600
the plus equal one

326
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,600
equals one okay what's the time complex

327
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,880
this is n

328
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,560
yeah square

329
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,639
these

330
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,880
these

331
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,079
almost yeah because we're converting the

332
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,360
set okay

333
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,279
converting to a set so this is

334
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,360
in the worst case in the worst case c

335
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,959
one the keys

336
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,800
could be n

337
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,600
and converting to the set

338
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,240
and then c to the keys okay so maybe we

339
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,959
can just ch check the values first we

340
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,920
can check if dance you want the keys

341
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,199
equals then stop c to the keys

342
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,000
right

343
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,839
yeah if they're the number

344
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,040
if the set if

345
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,279
the characters number is not equal then

346
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,399
there's no point to check the content of

347
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,240
it right yeah okay so this is

348
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,519
a lot faster than the previous one right

349
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,240
because look

350
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,199
these two operations

351
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,480
are one right

352
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,760
counter is basically like a hash table

353
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,480
when we're updating the values yeah and

354
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,199
all deleted values from the hash table

355
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,680
is

356
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,399
one constant it's constant time

357
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,720
all right

358
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,279
previous one we are we are creating we

359
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,839
need to count it right let's take our

360
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,959
own time so this is faster here make

361
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,600
sense

362
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,639
okay any questions so far

363
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,480
okay and no questions okay so what have

364
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,120
you learned today what's this approach

365
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,720
about stream shots uh can you tell me

366
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,760
every night what

367
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,680
is when

368
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,440
like you uh

369
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,320
split her

370
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,480
so how come how do we i mean what's the

371
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,680
approach here what's the approach here

372
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,360
today

373
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,360
can you explain to people yeah

374
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,149
[Music]

375
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,959
the number the number of distinct

376
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,279
characters in each string is the same

377
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,440
okay so it's here it's looking for the

378
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,399
number of distinct characters so it

379
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,880
doesn't compare the content okay okay so

380
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,040
the question okay so here

381
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,000
we are now comparing each one has to be

382
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,920
appear in the same so we can actually

383
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
change it to length we just compare with

384
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,920
the length okay that will be easier okay

385
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,279
okay

386
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,120
yeah the number of distinct characters

387
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,120
so it could be in each window here would

388
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,880
be a b here or b c d it doesn't matter

389
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,560
okay yeah

390
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,279
i see okay

391
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,360
okay so so look at here then if we

392
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,519
change here to length then this is

393
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,959
obviously o n right because checking the

394
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,519
length

395
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,079
is constant time okay

396
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,600
checking the lengths of constant okay so

397
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,680
what have you learned so far what's

398
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,680
what's the speed

399
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,000
we have to have same amount of number um

400
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,519
yeah and how are we doing this how can

401
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,199
we how do we use this we just like move

402
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,959
we slide in window yeah we move this

403
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,959
partition up and up day one

404
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,720
update each c1 and c2 okay yeah

405
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,480
we move one character to the right and

406
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,079
what should we do with the c1 what do we

407
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,720
do with the situation uh one increase it

408
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,559
gets one thing and one still

409
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,959
we're done okay that's it for today good

410
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,959
job bye
