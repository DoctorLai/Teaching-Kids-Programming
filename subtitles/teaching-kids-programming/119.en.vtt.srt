great good okay so
 

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,270
great good okay so
i'm i'm talking about uh a very basic

8
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:11,280
i'm i'm talking about uh a very basic
 

9
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,310
i'm i'm talking about uh a very basic
uh problem today which is the

10
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
uh problem today which is the
 

11
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,950
uh problem today which is the
uh usually the first questions to solve

12
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
uh usually the first questions to solve
 

13
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,150
uh usually the first questions to solve
when you want to do this

14
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,160
when you want to do this
 

15
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,710
when you want to do this
coding interviews okay so it's called

16
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
coding interviews okay so it's called
 

17
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,670
coding interviews okay so it's called
two sum

18
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,680
two sum
 

19
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,029
two sum
two sum so basically you're given a list

20
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:25,039
two sum so basically you're given a list
 

21
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,230
two sum so basically you're given a list
of numbers

22
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
of numbers
 

23
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,310
of numbers
yeah two one seven eight

24
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
yeah two one seven eight
 

25
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,670
yeah two one seven eight
five right no and then you're given a

26
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
five right no and then you're given a
 

27
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,229
five right no and then you're given a
target

28
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
target
 

29
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,350
target
seven okay so you need to return the

30
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
seven okay so you need to return the
 

31
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,709
seven okay so you need to return the
index you know the index

32
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
index you know the index
 

33
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,270
index you know the index
the first number the index is zero yeah

34
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,280
the first number the index is zero yeah
 

35
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,750
the first number the index is zero yeah
zero

36
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
zero
 

37
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,670
zero
one two three four this is called index

38
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
one two three four this is called index
 

39
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,350
one two three four this is called index
yeah because

40
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
yeah because
 

41
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,670
yeah because
in computers the array starts with index

42
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
in computers the array starts with index
 

43
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,510
in computers the array starts with index
zero this is called

44
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
zero this is called
 

45
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,630
zero this is called
the zero the index zero element yeah the

46
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
the zero the index zero element yeah the
 

47
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,510
the zero the index zero element yeah the
first element

48
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
first element
 

49
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,310
first element
first number so look the target is seven

50
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
first number so look the target is seven
 

51
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,709
first number so look the target is seven
so

52
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
so
 

53
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,069
so
which two numbers added to seven two and

54
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
which two numbers added to seven two and
 

55
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,470
which two numbers added to seven two and
five

56
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
five
 

57
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,029
five
two and five so this index is what that

58
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
two and five so this index is what that
 

59
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,630
two and five so this index is what that
doesn't have to be two numbers

60
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
doesn't have to be two numbers
 

61
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,990
doesn't have to be two numbers
yeah two numbers that's why we call it

62
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
yeah two numbers that's why we call it
 

63
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,830
yeah two numbers that's why we call it
two sum

64
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
two sum
 

65
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,830
two sum
okay so the first this is what's the

66
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
okay so the first this is what's the
 

67
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,310
okay so the first this is what's the
index of two

68
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320

 

69
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,590

what did i just say about the first

70
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
what did i just say about the first
 

71
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,390
what did i just say about the first
number starts with the index

72
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
number starts with the index
 

73
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,510
number starts with the index
zero one zero yeah and what's the index

74
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
zero one zero yeah and what's the index
 

75
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,109
zero one zero yeah and what's the index
of five

76
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119

 

77
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,789

what's the index of five how many

78
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
what's the index of five how many
 

79
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,310
what's the index of five how many
numbers yes that's right

80
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
numbers yes that's right
 

81
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,469
numbers yes that's right
so you just need to return zero and four

82
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
so you just need to return zero and four
 

83
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,789
so you just need to return zero and four
okay and you can only allow to

84
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
okay and you can only allow to
 

85
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,550
okay and you can only allow to
you are allowed to use the number only

86
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
you are allowed to use the number only
 

87
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,910
you are allowed to use the number only
once so you

88
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
once so you
 

89
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,630
once so you
if they are if the target is uh four

90
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
if they are if the target is uh four
 

91
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,190
if they are if the target is uh four
eight

92
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
eight
 

93
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,109
eight
yeah and there's a four here you are not

94
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
yeah and there's a four here you are not
 

95
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,030
yeah and there's a four here you are not
allowed to use the index

96
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
allowed to use the index
 

97
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,310
allowed to use the index
four twice am right all right yes

98
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
four twice am right all right yes
 

99
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,310
four twice am right all right yes
but you can if there are another four

100
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
but you can if there are another four
 

101
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,749
but you can if there are another four
here then you can return the index of

102
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
here then you can return the index of
 

103
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,789
here then you can return the index of
least and this right

104
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
least and this right
 

105
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,230
least and this right
doesn't make sense but you're not

106
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
doesn't make sense but you're not
 

107
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,230
doesn't make sense but you're not
allowed to return two index to some

108
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
allowed to return two index to some
 

109
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,950
allowed to return two index to some
index

110
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
index
 

111
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,429
index
does it make sense seven and one yeah

112
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
does it make sense seven and one yeah
 

113
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,670
does it make sense seven and one yeah
yeah yeah seven and one as well so

114
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
yeah yeah seven and one as well so
 

115
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,350
yeah yeah seven and one as well so
if there are multiple solutions return

116
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
if there are multiple solutions return
 

117
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,790
if there are multiple solutions return
any one of them okay

118
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
any one of them okay
 

119
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,589
any one of them okay
potentially the first first pair right

120
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
potentially the first first pair right
 

121
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,190
potentially the first first pair right
right does it make sense

122
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
right does it make sense
 

123
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,750
right does it make sense
okay so any idea how we're doing this

124
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
okay so any idea how we're doing this
 

125
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,350
okay so any idea how we're doing this
remember we talked about

126
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
remember we talked about
 

127
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,910
remember we talked about
yes pre-forcing so how are we performing

128
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
yes pre-forcing so how are we performing
 

129
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,110
yes pre-forcing so how are we performing
this kind of thing

130
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
this kind of thing
 

131
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,510
this kind of thing
so if there are n numbers then we try

132
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
so if there are n numbers then we try
 

133
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,990
so if there are n numbers then we try
each

134
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000

 

135
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,309

our power would be forcing

136
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319

 

137
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,790

each one each pair right without using

138
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
each one each pair right without using
 

139
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,949
each one each pair right without using
dynamic plugins that's okay that's not

140
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
dynamic plugins that's okay that's not
 

141
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,270
dynamic plugins that's okay that's not
the

142
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
the
 

143
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,070
the
problem look so pair they're in numbers

144
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
problem look so pair they're in numbers
 

145
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,190
problem look so pair they're in numbers
right

146
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
right
 

147
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,030
right
maybe we thought about like one two

148
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
maybe we thought about like one two
 

149
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,630
maybe we thought about like one two
three four four numbers and we want to

150
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
three four four numbers and we want to
 

151
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,670
three four four numbers and we want to
check if there are

152
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
check if there are
 

153
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,110
check if there are
numbers adding to six yeah so how many

154
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
numbers adding to six yeah so how many
 

155
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,229
numbers adding to six yeah so how many
pairs that we can

156
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
pairs that we can
 

157
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,350
pairs that we can
we can have one two one

158
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
we can have one two one
 

159
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,470
we can have one two one
three one four two three two

160
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
three one four two three two
 

161
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,390
three one four two three two
four three four all right t4

162
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
four three four all right t4
 

163
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,790
four three four all right t4
sorry yeah i know but this is the pairs

164
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
sorry yeah i know but this is the pairs
 

165
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,990
sorry yeah i know but this is the pairs
we need to check right

166
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
we need to check right
 

167
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,430
we need to check right
does it make sense so how many players

168
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
does it make sense so how many players
 

169
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,190
does it make sense so how many players
one to the six pairs right

170
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
one to the six pairs right
 

171
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,550
one to the six pairs right
all right six yeah it's six pairs

172
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
all right six yeah it's six pairs
 

173
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,229
all right six yeah it's six pairs
all right so so

174
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
all right so so
 

175
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,750
all right so so
so look i we can just do this

176
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
so look i we can just do this
 

177
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,430
so look i we can just do this
okay easy focusing define let's let's do

178
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
okay easy focusing define let's let's do
 

179
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,470
okay easy focusing define let's let's do
this two

180
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:22,480
this two
 

181
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,509
this two
two thumb and we're given the lumps

182
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
two thumb and we're given the lumps
 

183
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,830
two thumb and we're given the lumps
right and then given a target let's call

184
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
right and then given a target let's call
 

185
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,910
right and then given a target let's call
it what's missing

186
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
it what's missing
 

187
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,670
it what's missing
okay so look look the end the index

188
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
okay so look look the end the index
 

189
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,949
okay so look look the end the index
the maxima will be up to the n uh up to

190
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
the maxima will be up to the n uh up to
 

191
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,270
the maxima will be up to the n uh up to
n but not including right lens t right

192
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
n but not including right lens t right
 

193
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,509
n but not including right lens t right
right all right so this is the maximum

194
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
right all right so this is the maximum
 

195
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,270
right all right so this is the maximum
index the maximum index

196
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
index the maximum index
 

197
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,149
index the maximum index
n or what is it what's the maximum index

198
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
n or what is it what's the maximum index
 

199
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,990
n or what is it what's the maximum index
of this

200
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
of this
 

201
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,270
of this
of these t uh

202
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
of these t uh
 

203
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,750
of these t uh
n no n minus one remember it starts from

204
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
n no n minus one remember it starts from
 

205
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,470
n no n minus one remember it starts from
zero

206
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
zero
 

207
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,309
zero
yeah yeah i'm right if you have five

208
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
yeah yeah i'm right if you have five
 

209
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,589
yeah yeah i'm right if you have five
elements the

210
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
elements the
 

211
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,630
elements the
maximum index is what

212
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
maximum index is what
 

213
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,630
maximum index is what
five minus one four yeah we're done okay

214
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
five minus one four yeah we're done okay
 

215
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,750
five minus one four yeah we're done okay
so look

216
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
so look
 

217
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,949
so look
for i in rent

218
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
for i in rent
 

219
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,990
for i in rent
yeah and right so up to n right

220
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
yeah and right so up to n right
 

221
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,949
yeah and right so up to n right
look this is true forcing look and then

222
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
look this is true forcing look and then
 

223
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:13,509
look this is true forcing look and then
for

224
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
for
 

225
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,789
for
another loop right here for j in

226
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
another loop right here for j in
 

227
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,830
another loop right here for j in
range range what

228
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
range range what
 

229
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,830
range range what
i okay let's just start it from i

230
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
i okay let's just start it from i
 

231
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,870
i okay let's just start it from i
alright

232
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
alright
 

233
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,950
alright
uh up to i right let's if num

234
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
uh up to i right let's if num
 

235
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,390
uh up to i right let's if num
okay nums i plus num straight

236
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
okay nums i plus num straight
 

237
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,590
okay nums i plus num straight
equals equals what target actually let's

238
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
equals equals what target actually let's
 

239
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:35,909
equals equals what target actually let's
not

240
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
not
 

241
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,070
not
t let's numb okay okay

242
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
t let's numb okay okay
 

243
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,990
t let's numb okay okay
then we just return right return what

244
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
then we just return right return what
 

245
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,990
then we just return right return what
all right we can return j

246
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
all right we can return j
 

247
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,150
all right we can return j
i right right because j is smaller than

248
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
i right right because j is smaller than
 

249
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,070
i right right because j is smaller than
i right so we look when i

250
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
i right so we look when i
 

251
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,270
i right so we look when i
is five j will be in range

252
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
is five j will be in range
 

253
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,749
is five j will be in range
i will which will be zero to four right

254
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
i will which will be zero to four right
 

255
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,870
i will which will be zero to four right
j when j

256
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
j when j
 

257
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,310
j when j
when i is three what's the range of j

258
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
when i is three what's the range of j
 

259
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,990
when i is three what's the range of j
when i is three what's the range of

260
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
when i is three what's the range of
 

261
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,469
when i is three what's the range of
three

262
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479

 

263
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,230

is one two two zero to two

264
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
is one two two zero to two
 

265
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,430
is one two two zero to two
okay when i is four what's the range

266
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
okay when i is four what's the range
 

267
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:09,830
okay when i is four what's the range
three

268
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
three
 

269
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,469
three
okay so look if i plus j equals steven

270
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
okay so look if i plus j equals steven
 

271
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,830
okay so look if i plus j equals steven
with 10 ji right

272
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
with 10 ji right
 

273
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,220
with 10 ji right
what's the time complexity

274
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,230
what's the time complexity
 

275
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,670
what's the time complexity
[Music]

276
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
[Music]
 

277
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,830
[Music]
quite quite how many loops how many how

278
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840

 

279
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,870

many

280
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880

 

281
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,710

square why is that because look this

282
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
square why is that because look this
 

283
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,150
square why is that because look this
means

284
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
means
 

285
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,150
means
this is an iteration for each n it needs

286
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
this is an iteration for each n it needs
 

287
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,710
this is an iteration for each n it needs
roughly an iteration right linear right

288
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
roughly an iteration right linear right
 

289
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,629
roughly an iteration right linear right
so actually this is

290
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
so actually this is
 

291
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,189
so actually this is
this is what n squared divided by two

292
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
this is what n squared divided by two
 

293
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,150
this is what n squared divided by two
area look

294
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
area look
 

295
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,150
area look
this is n squared divided by two roughly

296
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
this is n squared divided by two roughly
 

297
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,150
this is n squared divided by two roughly
okay but we drop the constant

298
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
okay but we drop the constant
 

299
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,990
okay but we drop the constant
right we drop the constant so it's

300
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
right we drop the constant so it's
 

301
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,350
right we drop the constant so it's
quadratic

302
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360

 

303
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,430

can we do better this is too slow right

304
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
can we do better this is too slow right
 

305
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,230
can we do better this is too slow right
remember remember this is too slow this

306
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
remember remember this is too slow this
 

307
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,710
remember remember this is too slow this
is

308
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
is
 

309
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,510
is
uh this is too slow yeah when n is a

310
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
uh this is too slow yeah when n is a
 

311
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,150
uh this is too slow yeah when n is a
hundred

312
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
hundred
 

313
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,790
hundred
what's n square is a hundred hundred

314
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
what's n square is a hundred hundred
 

315
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,590
what's n square is a hundred hundred
yeah

316
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
yeah
 

317
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,469
yeah
when it's a thousand what's a thousand

318
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
when it's a thousand what's a thousand
 

319
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,150
when it's a thousand what's a thousand
six zero right

320
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
six zero right
 

321
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,029
six zero right
right you'll be a minion right when n

322
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
right you'll be a minion right when n
 

323
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,870
right you'll be a minion right when n
goes a thousand there will be a minion

324
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
goes a thousand there will be a minion
 

325
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,950
goes a thousand there will be a minion
so it's too slow right

326
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
so it's too slow right
 

327
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,230
so it's too slow right
and how can we do better how can we do

328
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
and how can we do better how can we do
 

329
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,270
and how can we do better how can we do
better

330
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280

 

331
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,390

eating using work yeah using something

332
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
eating using work yeah using something
 

333
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,150
eating using work yeah using something
using what

334
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
using what
 

335
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,350
using what
using what no book whatever why do we

336

right
is three in the number what do i need

378
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
is three in the number what do i need
 

379
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,309
is three in the number what do i need
for three to be in the notebook

380
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
for three to be in the notebook
 

381
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,230
for three to be in the notebook
first six yeah is three in a notebook

382
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
first six yeah is three in a notebook
 

383
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,430
first six yeah is three in a notebook
i put this over here four what do i need

384
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
i put this over here four what do i need
 

385
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,309
i put this over here four what do i need
three two is two in the number yes yeah

386
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
three two is two in the number yes yeah
 

387
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,909
three two is two in the number yes yeah
okay so we return the notebook which

388
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
okay so we return the notebook which
 

389
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,710
okay so we return the notebook which
will be

390
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
will be
 

391
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,189
will be
two two which is zero one we always

392
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
two two which is zero one we always
 

393
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,950
two two which is zero one we always
return the index here

394
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
return the index here
 

395
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,350
return the index here
okay so look it's one four right does it

396
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
okay so look it's one four right does it
 

397
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,150
okay so look it's one four right does it
make sense

398
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
make sense
 

399
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,790
make sense
yes how many paths do we need we're just

400
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
yes how many paths do we need we're just
 

401
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,309
yes how many paths do we need we're just
going from beginning to the end and

402
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
going from beginning to the end and
 

403
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:00,790
going from beginning to the end and
that's it

404
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
that's it
 

405
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,150
that's it
right yeah what's the time conversion

406
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
right yeah what's the time conversion
 

407
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,710
right yeah what's the time conversion
we're done why is the wind because we're

408
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
we're done why is the wind because we're
 

409
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,510
we're done why is the wind because we're
taking through

410
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
taking through
 

411
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,629
taking through
all of the notes only once

412
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
all of the notes only once
 

413
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,990
all of the notes only once
just one time what's the space

414
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
just one time what's the space
 

415
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,790
just one time what's the space
complexity

416
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800

 

417
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,110

why is that one because they're using a

418
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
why is that one because they're using a
 

419
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,830
why is that one because they're using a
network

420
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
network
 

421
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,629
network
okay let's try this did you see that

422
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
okay let's try this did you see that

yeah okay so that would be easier for
 

501
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:16,230
yeah okay so that would be easier for
i in v

502
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240

 

503
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:29,670

i will be

504
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680

 

505
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,710

the index index and v will be

506
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
the index index and v will be
 

507
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,400
the index index and v will be
what

508
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,410
what
 

509
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,829

the week yeah
so what do we need what number are we

522
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
so what do we need what number are we
 

523
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,069
so what do we need what number are we
looking for in the notebook

524
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079

 

525
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,269

i'll be looking for t

526
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
i'll be looking for t
 

527
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,470
i'll be looking for t
no we want to add it to t but now we

528
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
no we want to add it to t but now we
 

529
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,590
no we want to add it to t but now we
have v so what

530
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
have v so what
 

531
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,910
have v so what
number we need to uh looking for in the

532
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:05,920
number we need to uh looking for in the
 

533
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,350
number we need to uh looking for in the
notebook

534
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
notebook
 

535
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,630
notebook
we need to look for look we are look we

536
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
we need to look for look we are look we
 

537
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,069
we need to look for look we are look we
are now l4 but we are on the top

538
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
are now l4 but we are on the top
 

539
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,350
are now l4 but we are on the top
no we need to look for the two numbers

540
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
no we need to look for the two numbers
 

541
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,389
no we need to look for the two numbers
at to target yeah and one is t then

542
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
at to target yeah and one is t then
 

543
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,590
at to target yeah and one is t then
one is mean one is i

544
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
one is mean one is i
 

545
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,350
one is mean one is i
no come on what is v v plus something

546
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
no come on what is v v plus something
 

547
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,069
no come on what is v v plus something
equals t so what's to be something we

548
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
equals t so what's to be something we
 

549
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,590
equals t so what's to be something we
are looking for two numbers adding to t

550
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:31,600
are looking for two numbers adding to t
 

551
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,630
are looking for two numbers adding to t
we now have v

552
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
we now have v
 

553
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,790
we now have v
uh what's this one minus 19

554
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
uh what's this one minus 19
 

555
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,230
uh what's this one minus 19
yeah yeah look look

556
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
yeah yeah look look
 

557
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,829
yeah yeah look look
if t minus v in c

558
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
if t minus v in c
 

559
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,949
if t minus v in c
yeah you know in a row yeah

560
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
yeah you know in a row yeah
 

561
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,350
yeah you know in a row yeah
so now that we return we just because

562
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360

 

563
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,269

what's the current index what's the

564
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
what's the current index what's the
 

565
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,190
what's the current index what's the
current index

566
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
current index
 

567
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,310
current index
what's the current index uh i yeah and

568
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
what's the current index uh i yeah and
 

569
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,509
what's the current index uh i yeah and
what's the target

570
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
what's the target
 

571
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,829
what's the target
now this is the key right then we stole

572
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
now this is the key right then we stole
 

573
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,470
now this is the key right then we stole
the so

574
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480

 

575
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,590

t minus v this is the key right so in

576
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
t minus v this is the key right so in
 

577
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,870
t minus v this is the key right so in
the notebook what we saw

578
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
the notebook what we saw
 

579
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,310
the notebook what we saw
we saw alright we store the key

580
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
we saw alright we store the key
 

581
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,389
we saw alright we store the key
as the value and we store the value

582
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
as the value and we store the value
 

583
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,110
as the value and we store the value
as the index right all right look at

584
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
as the index right all right look at
 

585
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,829
as the index right all right look at
everything

586
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
everything
 

587
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,710
everything
one two three so let's place in the

588
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
one two three so let's place in the
 

589
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,710
one two three so let's place in the
notebook what we are storing is that

590
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
notebook what we are storing is that
 

591
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,310
notebook what we are storing is that
one will be zero the key will be one

592
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
one will be zero the key will be one
 

593
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,069
one will be zero the key will be one
yeah two will be one three will be what

594
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
yeah two will be one three will be what
 

595
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,350
yeah two will be one three will be what
it will be one three will be yeah two

596
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
it will be one three will be yeah two
 

597
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,550
it will be one three will be yeah two
done so look the index of index of t

598
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
done so look the index of index of t
 

599
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,590
done so look the index of index of t
minus v is c t minus v right

600
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
minus v is c t minus v right
 

601
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,389
minus v is c t minus v right
so what's what's meaning here don't say

602
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
so what's what's meaning here don't say
 

603
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:46,710
so what's what's meaning here don't say
we

604
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
we
 

605
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,710
we
don't say now so what we need to put

606
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
don't say now so what we need to put
 

607
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,470
don't say now so what we need to put
this v

608

this v
 

609
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,590
this v
in a notebook with index i right yes
