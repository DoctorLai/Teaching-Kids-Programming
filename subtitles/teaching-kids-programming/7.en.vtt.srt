computer
 

91
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,070
computer
in data structure we we we plot a tree

92

00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
okay so this is called a tree now
 

171
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,909
okay so this is called a tree now
another property

172
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
another property
 

173
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,029
another property
is that if if we say

174
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
is that if if we say
 

175
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,150
is that if if we say
uh a parent can have at most two

176
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
uh a parent can have at most two
 

177
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,830
uh a parent can have at most two
kids okay so if a parent can only have

178
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
kids okay so if a parent can only have
 

179
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,150
kids okay so if a parent can only have
two

180
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
two
 

181
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,350
two
kids so you cannot have more right like

182
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
kids so you cannot have more right like
 

183
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,070
kids so you cannot have more right like
that

184
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
that
 

185
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,189
that
it means four that's that's okay so

186
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
it means four that's that's okay so
 

187
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,990
it means four that's that's okay so
these

188
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
these
 

189
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,430
these
if but if a note a parent

190
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
if but if a note a parent
 

191
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,070
if but if a note a parent
can have at most two kids we call it

192
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
can have at most two kids we call it
 

193
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,029
can have at most two kids we call it
binary tree

194
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
binary tree
 

195
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,790
binary tree
because you know what's this meaning

196
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
because you know what's this meaning
 

197
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,270
because you know what's this meaning

library i know binary is two

200
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
library i know binary is two
 

201
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,590
library i know binary is two
you know it means zero or one two

202
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
you know it means zero or one two
 

203
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,430
you know it means zero or one two
two maximum let's call binary tree

204
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
two maximum let's call binary tree
 

205
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,310
two maximum let's call binary tree
okay to get it so we cannot if it's

206
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
okay to get it so we cannot if it's
 

207
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,870
okay to get it so we cannot if it's
binary we can call this left triad

208
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
binary we can call this left triad
 

209
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,230
binary we can call this left triad
and this is right trial right left

210
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
and this is right trial right left
 

211
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,430
and this is right trial right left
we can call it right all right

212
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
we can call it right all right
 

213
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,749
we can call it right all right
let's try that because it's finally yeah

214
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
let's try that because it's finally yeah
 

215
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,550
let's try that because it's finally yeah
this is very

216
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
this is very
 

217
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,830
this is very
hot important apparently okay so another

218
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
hot important apparently okay so another
 

219
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,909
hot important apparently okay so another
thing is

220
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
thing is
 

221
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,590
thing is
another thing is what if if it's a final

222
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
another thing is what if if it's a final
 

223
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,629
another thing is what if if it's a final
tree okay if it's a final entry

224
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
tree okay if it's a final entry
 

225
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,550
tree okay if it's a final entry
so if it's a binary tree like that

226
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
so if it's a binary tree like that
 

227
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,309
so if it's a binary tree like that
finally three three are terrible

228
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
finally three three are terrible
 

229
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,350
finally three three are terrible
so that's one two three four

230
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
so that's one two three four
 

231
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,150
so that's one two three four
five six seven so if it's a final

232
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
five six seven so if it's a final
 

233
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,110
five six seven so if it's a final
retreat

234

235
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,629

00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
and every every triad except the last
 

237
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,749

is it suppose that we see the depths we

264
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
is it suppose that we see the depths we
 

265
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,749
is it suppose that we see the depths we

yeah it's seven how how do you know and
 

271
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,230
yeah it's seven how how do you know and
how about if the depth is four

00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
how about if the depth is four
 

273
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,230
how about if the depth is four
and how many how many notes are there

274
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
and how many how many notes are there
 

275
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,510
and how many how many notes are there
two can you count

276
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
two can you count
 

277
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,629

279
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,629
if it's the depth look if stats is three
if it does the three we got the total

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
if it does the three we got the total
 

281
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,990
if it does the three we got the total
notes is seven you have

notes is seven you have
 

283
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,390
notes is seven you have
one two three four five six seven if

284
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
one two three four five six seven if
 

285
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,510

two to the power of five minus one is
thirty one okay

336
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
thirty one okay
 

337
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,870
thirty one okay
get it nine yeah nine

338
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
get it nine yeah nine
 

339
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,430
get it nine yeah nine
how do you get is thirty one because i

340
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
how do you get is thirty one because i
 

341
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,149
how do you get is thirty one because i
know

342
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
know
 

343
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,829
know
because nothing we know that's 15

344
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
because nothing we know that's 15
 

345
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,269
because nothing we know that's 15
so 15 okay so

346
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
so 15 okay so
 

347
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,070
so 15 okay so
that's that's eight double sixteen

348
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
that's that's eight double sixteen
 

349
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,550
that's that's eight double sixteen
sixteen

350
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
sixteen
 

351
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,590
sixteen
sixteen thirty one dab okay

352
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
sixteen thirty one dab okay
 

353
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,750
sixteen thirty one dab okay
okay so this is the equation yeah if the

354
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
okay so this is the equation yeah if the
 

355
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,910
okay so this is the equation yeah if the
depth of the binary tree is c

356
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
depth of the binary tree is c
 

357
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,430
depth of the binary tree is c
the perfect the perfect minor tree is

358
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
the perfect the perfect minor tree is
 

359
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,990
the perfect the perfect minor tree is
the node has has two to the power of t

360
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
the node has has two to the power of t
 

361
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,030
the node has has two to the power of t
minus one notes

362
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
minus one notes
 

363
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,070
minus one notes
okay we'll get it like

364
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
okay we'll get it like
 

365
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,110
okay we'll get it like
two two to the power of two minus one

366
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
two two to the power of two minus one
 

367
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,710
two two to the power of two minus one
equals three okay there's

368
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
equals three okay there's
 

369
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,070
equals three okay there's
one two three okay get it easy and only

370
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
one two three okay get it easy and only
 

371
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,710
one two three okay get it easy and only
one note

372
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
one note
 

373
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,030
one note
two to the power of one minus one equals

374
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
two to the power of one minus one equals
 

375
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,990
two to the power of one minus one equals
one yes

376
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
one yes
 

377
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,310
one yes
it makes sense yes yeah because we only

378
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
it makes sense yes yeah because we only
 

379
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,870
it makes sense yes yeah because we only
have one note it's only one depth

380
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
have one note it's only one depth
 

381
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,710
have one note it's only one depth
depth equals one okay this is called

382
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
depth equals one okay this is called
 

383
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,350
depth equals one okay this is called
perfect binary tree

384
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
perfect binary tree
 

385
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,949

409
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,509

so how can we store it in the computer

410
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
so how can we store it in the computer
 

411
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,110
so how can we store it in the computer
yes no not that we can use the list to

412
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
yes no not that we can use the list to

463
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,110

two to the power two is two

464
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
two to the power two is two
 

465
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,470
two to the power two is two
parallel each kid is five one five and

466
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
parallel each kid is five one five and
 

467
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,470
parallel each kid is five one five and
one six so this is index

468
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
one six so this is index
 

469
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,190
one six so this is index
so we can get to the index right look at

470
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
so we can get to the index right look at
 

471
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,430
so we can get to the index right look at
this two

472
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
this two
 

473
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,389
this two
two two times two plus one double p

474
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
two two times two plus one double p
 

475
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,750
two two times two plus one double p
is left kick two times two plus two that

476
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
is left kick two times two plus two that
 

477
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,389
is left kick two times two plus two that
will be

478
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
will be
 

479
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,790
will be
right right right and right kid all

480
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
right right right and right kid all
 

481
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,269
right right right and right kid all
right the second kid

482
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
right the second kid
 

483
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,990
right the second kid
let's take one for example one times one

484
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
let's take one for example one times one
 

485
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,069
let's take one for example one times one
times two

486
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
times two
 

487
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,910
times two
plus one equals three right

488
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
plus one equals three right
 

489
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,870
plus one equals three right
and one times two equals plus two equals

490
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
and one times two equals plus two equals
 

491
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,350
and one times two equals plus two equals
four

492
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
four
 

493
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,269
four
okay so get it okay so let's do another

494
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
okay so get it okay so let's do another
 

495
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:21,750
okay so get it okay so let's do another
example

496
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
example
 

497
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,110
example
zero cl times what two plus one

498
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
zero cl times what two plus one
 

499
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,910
zero cl times what two plus one
equals one zero times two plus two

500
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
equals one zero times two plus two
 

501
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,110
equals one zero times two plus two
equals two

502
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
equals two
 

503
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,590
equals two
okay so does it make sense so if it's a

504
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
okay so does it make sense so if it's a
 

505
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,509
okay so does it make sense so if it's a
perfect binary tree

506
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
perfect binary tree
 

507
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,470
perfect binary tree
if if the index we store it in a in an

508
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
if if the index we store it in a in an
 

509
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:36,949
if if the index we store it in a in an
array

510
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
array
 

511
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,310
array
if the index of parent of node is i

512
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
if the index of parent of node is i
 

513
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,910
if the index of parent of node is i
then its left kit is two times i

514
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
then its left kit is two times i
 

515
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,710
then its left kit is two times i
plus one and its right kid is two times

516
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
plus one and its right kid is two times
 

517
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,790
plus one and its right kid is two times
i plus two m right

518
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
i plus two m right
 

519
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,590
i plus two m right
do you get it so we can store in a list

520
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
do you get it so we can store in a list
 

521
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,430
do you get it so we can store in a list
okay

522
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
okay
 

523
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,430
okay
you get it okay so how do we

524
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
you get it okay so how do we
 

525
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,470
you get it okay so how do we
visit the let's say okay

526
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
visit the let's say okay
 

527
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,190
visit the let's say okay
let's give an example okay for example

528
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
let's give an example okay for example
 

529
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,069
let's give an example okay for example
let's given this tree

530
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
let's given this tree
 

531
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,670
let's given this tree
can you please pick a boy please

532
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
can you please pick a boy please
 

533
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,509
can you please pick a boy please
okay that's the coating part okay that's

534
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
okay that's the coating part okay that's
 

535
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,949
okay that's the coating part okay that's
the coding bag

536
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
the coding bag
 

537
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,629
the coding bag
so if a tree is binary and

538
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
so if a tree is binary and
 

539
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,430
so if a tree is binary and
i want to i want to compute

540
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
i want to i want to compute
 

541
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,629
i want to i want to compute
i i want to compute the path

542
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
i i want to compute the path
 

543
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,230
i i want to compute the path
how do i how do i read how do i do it

544
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
how do i how do i read how do i do it
 

545
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,269
how do i how do i read how do i do it
like if it's a node is like that it's

546
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
like if it's a node is like that it's
 

547
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,430
like if it's a node is like that it's
3 five

548
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:35,440
3 five
 

549
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,189

and the other seven okay let's give them
 

555
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,350
and the other seven okay let's give them
a treat like that that's given a tree

556
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
a treat like that that's given a tree
 

557
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,550
a treat like that that's given a tree
so if i want to visit that tree

558
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
so if i want to visit that tree
 

559
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,910
so if i want to visit that tree
in i want to visit this order in

560

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,870
up okay
so we use a queue to to

666
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
so we use a queue to to
 

667
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,150
so we use a queue to to
to get it yeah every time we push a kill

668
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
to get it yeah every time we push a kill
 

669
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,749
to get it yeah every time we push a kill
we put a note here dude here and then we

670
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
we put a note here dude here and then we
 

671
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,430
we put a note here dude here and then we
we push we push his kit into the kill

672
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
we push we push his kit into the kill
 

673
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,269
we push we push his kit into the kill
and then we until we do it until the

674
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
and then we until we do it until the
 

675
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,189
and then we until we do it until the
kill is empty

676
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
kill is empty
 

677
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,870
kill is empty
okay okay and i'm going to introduce

678
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
okay okay and i'm going to introduce
 

679
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,870
okay okay and i'm going to introduce
another another key

680
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
another another key
 

681
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,710
another another key
another tree okay come here right

seven and three yes i look closely what
 

711
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,789
seven and three yes i look closely what
what what do you see this tree

712
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
what what do you see this tree
 

713
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,150
what what do you see this tree
what is it like

so what happened to the tree i mean look
 

737
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,590
so what happened to the tree i mean look
the left are always smaller oh yeah

738
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
the left are always smaller oh yeah
 

739

look nice smaller than 10 is bigger
 

757
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,430

seven is smaller

758
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440

 

759
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,710

smaller this will get bigger yeah yeah

760
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,720
smaller this will get bigger yeah yeah
 

761
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,630
smaller this will get bigger yeah yeah
so for so we can call this tree

762
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,640
so for so we can call this tree
 

763
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,789
so for so we can call this tree
binary search yeah final research tree

764
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:24,799
binary search yeah final research tree
 

765
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,150
binary search yeah final research tree
how do you know

766
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
how do you know
 

767
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,510
how do you know
i just heard it before okay so for

768
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
i just heard it before okay so for
 

769
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,549
i just heard it before okay so for
a final research tree it means that the

770
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559
a final research tree it means that the
 

771
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,510
a final research tree it means that the
left nose

772
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
left nose
 

773
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,830
left nose
always smaller than parents but right

774
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:35,840
always smaller than parents but right
 

775
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,470
always smaller than parents but right
now always speaking apparent

776
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,480
now always speaking apparent
 

777
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,830
now always speaking apparent
why is that useful because look if we

778
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
why is that useful because look if we
 

779
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,750
why is that useful because look if we
want to find the number nine

780
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
want to find the number nine
 

781
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,430
want to find the number nine
right yeah if it's in another way we

782
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
right yeah if it's in another way we
 

783
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,310
right yeah if it's in another way we
don't know if it's

784
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,320
don't know if it's
 

785
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,270
don't know if it's
like that if it's a way list

786
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
like that if it's a way list
 

787
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,390
like that if it's a way list
we have to search for

788
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
we have to search for
 

789
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,549
we have to search for
player and and items we need to search

790
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
player and and items we need to search
 

791
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,549
player and and items we need to search
end times to to find the nine

792
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
end times to to find the nine
 

793
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,110
end times to to find the nine
okay if we see in the last element right

794
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
okay if we see in the last element right
 

795
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,190
okay if we see in the last element right
but for this we don't

796
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
but for this we don't
 

797
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,230
but for this we don't
we knight if it's bigger than a is it

798
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
we knight if it's bigger than a is it
 

799
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,190
we knight if it's bigger than a is it
bigger than a

800
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
bigger than a
 

801
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,310
bigger than a
yeah yeah yeah so it must be in

802
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
yeah yeah yeah so it must be in
 

803
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,190
yeah yeah yeah so it must be in
somewhere here

804
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
somewhere here
 

805
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,669
somewhere here
right and we don't need to consider this

806
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
right and we don't need to consider this
 

807
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,029
right and we don't need to consider this
bit right because

808
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
bit right because
 

809
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,750
bit right because
this bit is the left left is always

810
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
this bit is the left left is always
 

811
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,470
this bit is the left left is always
smaller than

812
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
smaller than
 

813
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,590
smaller than
a but i'm looking for nine so you must

814
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
a but i'm looking for nine so you must
 

815
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,310
a but i'm looking for nine so you must
be somewhere in the right tree right

816
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
be somewhere in the right tree right
 

817
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,510
be somewhere in the right tree right
okay and it's nice smaller than ten nine

818
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
okay and it's nice smaller than ten nine
 

819
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,870
okay and it's nice smaller than ten nine
smaller than that

820
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
smaller than that
 

821
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,590
smaller than that
yes then we could go left so every time

822
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,600
yes then we could go left so every time
 

823
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:33,990
yes then we could go left so every time
we go

824
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
we go
 

825
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,669
we go
left or right depending on the value

826
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:35,679
left or right depending on the value
 

827
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,190
left or right depending on the value
don't get it

828
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
don't get it
 

829
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,909
don't get it
yeah so we look we only need to find

830
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
yeah so we look we only need to find
 

831
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,830
yeah so we look we only need to find
three times

832
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:41,840
three times
 

833
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,029
three times
compared to these linears we are faster

834
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039
compared to these linears we are faster
 

835
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,149
compared to these linears we are faster
right

836
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
right
 

837
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,430
right

good job okay so uh today
 

841
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,990
good job okay so uh today
there'll be no coding okay because this

842
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
there'll be no coding okay because this
 

843
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,830
there'll be no coding okay because this
is a bit difficult we'll do the coding

844
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
is a bit difficult we'll do the coding
 

845
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,110
is a bit difficult we'll do the coding
in the next lesson

846
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
in the next lesson
 

847
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,430
in the next lesson
we are going to introduce more about a

848
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
we are going to introduce more about a
 

849
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,470
we are going to introduce more about a
tree okay

850
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
tree okay
 

851
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,710
tree okay
happy happy nothing happens

852
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
happy happy nothing happens
 

853
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,430

okay so
 

857
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,830
okay so
okay so can you draw a tree compute a

858
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
okay so can you draw a tree compute a
 

859
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,750
okay so can you draw a tree compute a
tree in computer right

860
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:21,760
tree in computer right
 

861
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,669
tree in computer right
yes come here come here just to make

862
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
yes come here come here just to make
 

863

sure you remember this
 

865
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:43,029
sure you remember this
can you draw a tree a

866
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039

 

867
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,590

you draw a good tree

868
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600

 

869
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,110
