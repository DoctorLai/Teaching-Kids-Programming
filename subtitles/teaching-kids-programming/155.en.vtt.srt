so when you accumulate this array

32
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
so when you accumulate this array
 

33
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,029
so when you accumulate this array
what happened i i then you tell me what

34
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
what happened i i then you tell me what
 

35
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,910
what happened i i then you tell me what
does it do yeah

we're using this year so these two are
provides many many functions so this

206
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
provides many many functions so this
 

207
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,870
provides many many functions so this
this i think it's from here so look

208
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
this i think it's from here so look
 

209
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,150
this i think it's from here so look
so look if array is equal

210
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
so look if array is equal
 

211
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,270
so look if array is equal
in a circle okay so

212
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
in a circle okay so
 

213
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,590
in a circle okay so
like that and then look let's say

214
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
like that and then look let's say
 

215
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,950
like that and then look let's say
a equals equals what

216
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
a equals equals what
 

217
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,110
a equals equals what

219
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,550

yeah and then you accumulated to take

220
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
yeah and then you accumulated to take
 

221
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,070
yeah and then you accumulated to take
and you want to print it print it you

222
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
and you want to print it print it you
 

223
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,950
and you want to print it print it you
can say print

224
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
can say print
 

225
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,029
can say print
it print but you need to turn this into

226
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
it print but you need to turn this into
 

227
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,790
it print but you need to turn this into
a list because this is a

228
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
a list because this is a
 

229
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,990
a list because this is a
iterator generator remember so if

230
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
iterator generator remember so if
 

231
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,990
iterator generator remember so if
this generator what does it give you it

232
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
this generator what does it give you it
 

233
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,830
this generator what does it give you it
gives you one element at a time right so

234
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
gives you one element at a time right so
 

235
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,189
gives you one element at a time right so
you can fall

236
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
you can fall
 

237
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,070
you can fall
i in accumulate do this then you'll

238
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
i in accumulate do this then you'll
 

239
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,270
i in accumulate do this then you'll
print it one

240
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
print it one
 

241
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,469
print it one
three four ten right so bring list

242
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
three four ten right so bring list
 

243
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,749
three four ten right so bring list
a then it will give me

244
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
a then it will give me
 

245
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,029
a then it will give me
one three 6 10 right

246
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
one three 6 10 right
 

247
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,310
one three 6 10 right
yeah all right how can we implement this

248
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
yeah all right how can we implement this
 

249
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,510
yeah all right how can we implement this
function

250
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
function
 

251
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,550
function
okay define yeah let's say we don't want

252
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
okay define yeah let's say we don't want
 

253
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,270
okay define yeah let's say we don't want
to use the

254
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
to use the
 

255
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,390
to use the
we want to reinvent the rear wheel okay

256
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
we want to reinvent the rear wheel okay
 

257
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,870
we want to reinvent the rear wheel okay
define let's just do call accumulator

258
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
define let's just do call accumulator
 

259
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,870
define let's just do call accumulator
accumulate i'll go q

260
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
accumulate i'll go q
 

261
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,070
accumulate i'll go q
mu later okay and then let's say a

262
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
mu later okay and then let's say a
 

263
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,390
mu later okay and then let's say a
is the number with the array right all

264
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
is the number with the array right all
 

265
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,110
is the number with the array right all
right

266
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
right
 

267
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,629
right
all right look so look

268
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
all right look so look
 

269
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,350
all right look so look
what so how can we do this

270
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360

 

271
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,710

we can change the numbers in the uh

272
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
we can change the numbers in the uh
 

273
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,870
we can change the numbers in the uh
we can change this array if you want we

274
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
we can change this array if you want we
 

275
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,950
we can change this array if you want we
can change it we don't need to

276
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
can change it we don't need to
 

277
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,070
can change it we don't need to
we don't need to create a copy look we

278
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
we don't need to create a copy look we
 

279
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,230
we don't need to create a copy look we
can change it look for

280
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
can change it look for
 

281
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,070
can change it look for
i in range

282
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
i in range
 

283
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,870
i in range
range let's say one to length we start

284
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
range let's say one to length we start
 

285
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,150
range let's say one to length we start
from the first one right because the

286
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
from the first one right because the
 

287
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,629
from the first one right because the
first

288
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
first
 

289
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,150
first
well no we start from the second one the

290
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
well no we start from the second one the
 

291
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,670
well no we start from the second one the
first element is there's no change right

292
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
first element is there's no change right
 

293
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,870
first element is there's no change right
everything

294
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
everything
 

295
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,550
everything
look one two three four so how can we

296
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
look one two three four so how can we
 

297
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:38,870
look one two three four so how can we
change

298
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
change
 

299
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,950
change
this all right the first one doesn't

300
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
this all right the first one doesn't
 

301
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,150
this all right the first one doesn't
change right

302
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
change right
 

303
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,469
change right
the second one is equals to its number

304
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
the second one is equals to its number
 

305
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,230
the second one is equals to its number
plus the previous one is

306
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
plus the previous one is
 

307
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,510
plus the previous one is
three right now what's the next

308
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
three right now what's the next
 

309
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,070
three right now what's the next
is three plus its previous one three

310
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
is three plus its previous one three
 

311
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,350
is three plus its previous one three
which is six

312
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
which is six
 

313
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,189
which is six
and what's next is four plus the

314
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
and what's next is four plus the
 

315
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,070
and what's next is four plus the
previous one

316
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
previous one
 

317
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:20,710
previous one
yeah does it make sense

318
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720

 

319
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,550

what did i just say

320
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560

 

321
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,629

so what we start from the second number

322
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
so what we start from the second number
 

323
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,670
so what we start from the second number
so every time

324
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
so every time
 

325
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,749
so every time
this number we want to update it with

326
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
this number we want to update it with
 

327
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,870
this number we want to update it with
the sum

328
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
the sum
 

329
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,510
the sum
plus the next one the previous one come

330
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
plus the next one the previous one come
 

331
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,230
plus the next one the previous one come
on why is the next one

332
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
on why is the next one
 

333
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,589
on why is the next one
what what's previous one minus one

334
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
what what's previous one minus one
 

335
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,950
what what's previous one minus one
i minus one and then return a yeah

336
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
i minus one and then return a yeah
 

337
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,550
i minus one and then return a yeah
because when you return a that's at

338
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
because when you return a that's at
 

339
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,950
because when you return a that's at
least that's not generator

340
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
least that's not generator
 

341
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,390
least that's not generator
so how can we make it a generator

342
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
so how can we make it a generator
 

343
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,510
so how can we make it a generator
can you win yeah remember we

344
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
can you win yeah remember we
 

345
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,510
can you win yeah remember we
seen this keyword before yeah from a

346
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
seen this keyword before yeah from a
 

347
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,749
seen this keyword before yeah from a
that's it we because we want to yet one

348
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
that's it we because we want to yet one
 

349
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,350
that's it we because we want to yet one
element at a time we don't want to get

350
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
element at a time we don't want to get
 

351
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,309
element at a time we don't want to get
the same thing

352
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
the same thing
 

353
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,869
the same thing
so from a means that we want to eat one

354
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
so from a means that we want to eat one
 

355
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,950
so from a means that we want to eat one
element and the ten so it will give me

356
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
element and the ten so it will give me
 

357
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,029
element and the ten so it will give me
exactly so this is exactly the same

358
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
exactly so this is exactly the same
 

359
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,070
exactly so this is exactly the same
function as

360
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
function as
 

361
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,589
function as
from iterators input accumulate it's the

362
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
from iterators input accumulate it's the
 

363
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,550
from iterators input accumulate it's the
same thing yeah

364
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
same thing yeah
 

365
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,790
same thing yeah
we invent the wheel yeah we invent

366
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
we invent the wheel yeah we invent
 

367
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,230
we invent the wheel yeah we invent
the wheel what does it mean so it means

368
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
the wheel what does it mean so it means
 

369
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,350
the wheel what does it mean so it means
we already know have

370
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
we already know have
 

371
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,990
we already know have
uh we but we want to reinvent it right

372
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
uh we but we want to reinvent it right
 

373
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,510
uh we but we want to reinvent it right
we don't take it again

374
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
we don't take it again
 

375
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,990
we don't take it again
make it again yeah so while we're making

376
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
make it again yeah so while we're making
 

377
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,990
make it again yeah so while we're making
it we just i just want to

378
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
it we just i just want to
 

379
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,190
it we just i just want to
demonstrate how what's behind it right

380
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
demonstrate how what's behind it right
 

381
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,790
demonstrate how what's behind it right
the accumulated function that's why it

382
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
the accumulated function that's why it
 

383
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,230
the accumulated function that's why it
is yeah

384
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
is yeah
 

385
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,190
is yeah
yeah all right we are modifying this if

386
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
yeah all right we are modifying this if
 

387
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,709
yeah all right we are modifying this if
we want to

388
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
we want to
 

389
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,389
we want to
if we want to make a copy we can do we

390
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:46,399
if we want to make a copy we can do we
 

391
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,990
if we want to make a copy we can do we
can say like a new right

392
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
can say like a new right
 

393
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,870
can say like a new right
new array right equals deep copy

394
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
new array right equals deep copy
 

395
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,990
new array right equals deep copy
copy don't be copy right hey

396
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
copy don't be copy right hey
 

397
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,350
copy don't be copy right hey
all right we're gonna copy a one and

398
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
all right we're gonna copy a one and
 

399
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,030
all right we're gonna copy a one and
then we can do this

400
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
then we can do this
 

401
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,910
then we can do this
and then we can we can do this n equals

402
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
and then we can we can do this n equals
 

403
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,030
and then we can we can do this n equals
it's the same thing yeah

404
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
it's the same thing yeah
 

405
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,230
it's the same thing yeah
doesn't make sense yeah

406
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
doesn't make sense yeah
 

407
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,630
doesn't make sense yeah
oh we don't need we can do this all

408
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
oh we don't need we can do this all
 

409
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,710
oh we don't need we can do this all
right create a new array

410
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
right create a new array
 

411
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,470
right create a new array
but instead instead we can do this

412
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
but instead instead we can do this
 

413
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,590
but instead instead we can do this
and the append because our and

414
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
and the append because our and
 

415
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,750
and the append because our and
the first first element it needs to

416
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
the first first element it needs to
 

417
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,670
the first first element it needs to
contain the first element right

418
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
contain the first element right
 

419
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,150
contain the first element right
and then the second element will be and

420
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
and then the second element will be and
 

421
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,710
and then the second element will be and
append

422
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
append
 

423
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,870
append
up and what a i

424
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
up and what a i
 

425
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,110
up and what a i
ai is current element right

426
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120

 

427
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,350

plus and minus one right

428
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
plus and minus one right
 

429
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,470
plus and minus one right
all right does it make sense so

430
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
all right does it make sense so
 

431
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,230
all right does it make sense so
it's the same thing so every time you

432
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
it's the same thing so every time you
 

433
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,630
it's the same thing so every time you
append the current element

434
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
append the current element
 

435
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,829
append the current element
and the previous element pretty

436
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
and the previous element pretty
 

437
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,350
and the previous element pretty
previous element of n look look eric

438
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
previous element of n look look eric
 

439
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,790
previous element of n look look eric
the a a is a is one one two

440
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
the a a is a is one one two
 

441
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,110
the a a is a is one one two
three four right and and at the

442
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
three four right and and at the
 

443
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,910
three four right and and at the
beginning i

444
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
beginning i
 

445
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,790
beginning i
set it to the first element which is one

446
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
set it to the first element which is one
 

447
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,509
set it to the first element which is one
okay

448
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
okay
 

449
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,550
okay
and then do this i will be two here

450
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
and then do this i will be two here
 

451
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,509
and then do this i will be two here
right

452
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
right
 

453
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,110
right
and apparent a i two plus

454
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
and apparent a i two plus
 

455
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,069
and apparent a i two plus
one right the last element of n is three

456
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
one right the last element of n is three
 

457
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,269
one right the last element of n is three
so i probably

458
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
so i probably
 

459
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,829
so i probably
one three here okay so next one

460
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
one three here okay so next one
 

461
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,790
one three here okay so next one
i equals three right i a i is three

462
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
i equals three right i a i is three
 

463
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,910
i equals three right i a i is three
three plus

464
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
three plus
 

465
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,150
three plus
the last element of n is three so six

466
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
the last element of n is three so six
 

467
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,110
the last element of n is three so six
right and the next one four plus the

468
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
right and the next one four plus the
 

469
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,069
right and the next one four plus the
last element of

470
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
last element of
 

471
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,509
last element of
n is 6 so that's 10 right

472
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
n is 6 so that's 10 right
 

473
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,150
n is 6 so that's 10 right
does it make sense yeah this is the

474
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
does it make sense yeah this is the
 

475
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,230
does it make sense yeah this is the
making a copy but we don't need to as i

476
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
making a copy but we don't need to as i
 

477
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,949
making a copy but we don't need to as i
said we can just directly

478
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
said we can just directly
 

479
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,110
said we can just directly
directly multiplying yeah a i plus equal

480
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
directly multiplying yeah a i plus equal
 

481
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,190
directly multiplying yeah a i plus equal
ai minus one so basically when you add

482
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
ai minus one so basically when you add
 

483
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,509
ai minus one so basically when you add
in this a i minus one it's already the

484
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
in this a i minus one it's already the
 

485
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,110
in this a i minus one it's already the
sum

486
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
sum
 

487
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,230
sum
of the previous field previous i minus

488
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
of the previous field previous i minus
 

489
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,350
of the previous field previous i minus
one item right yeah so we can reuse this

490
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
one item right yeah so we can reuse this
 

491
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,069
one item right yeah so we can reuse this
does it make sense

492
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
does it make sense
 

493
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,550
does it make sense
eric look here a i start with here yeah

494
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
eric look here a i start with here yeah
 

495
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,150
eric look here a i start with here yeah
okay so two two plus the previous item

496
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
okay so two two plus the previous item
 

497
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,350
okay so two two plus the previous item
is one right

498
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
is one right
 

499
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,269
is one right
yeah i raise it three

500
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
yeah i raise it three
 

501
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,150
yeah i raise it three
so now the next three plus the previous

502
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
so now the next three plus the previous
 

503
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,990
so now the next three plus the previous
item

504
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
item
 

505
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,470
item
yeah does it make sense and i call it

506
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
yeah does it make sense and i call it
 

507
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,829
yeah does it make sense and i call it
here four

508
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
here four
 

509
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,550
here four
plus the previous item ten does that

510
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
plus the previous item ten does that
 

511
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,430
plus the previous item ten does that
make sense

512
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
make sense
 

513
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,949
make sense
yeah yeah what's the time complexity

514
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
yeah yeah what's the time complexity
 

515
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,710
yeah yeah what's the time complexity
n yeah what's the space complexity

516
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
n yeah what's the space complexity
 

517
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,710
n yeah what's the space complexity
if we are modifying this what's the

518
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
if we are modifying this what's the
 

519
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,470
if we are modifying this what's the
space complexity

520
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
space complexity
 

521
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,310
space complexity
we are modifying it we don't we are not

522
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
we are modifying it we don't we are not
 

523
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,750
we are modifying it we don't we are not
using any additional array

524
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760

 

525
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,230

we are not using any other things we are

526
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
we are not using any other things we are
 

527
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,790
we are not using any other things we are
all

528
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
all
 

529
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,389
all
we are this is input what's the term

530
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
we are this is input what's the term
 

531
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,910
we are this is input what's the term
why is that we are not using any space

532
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920

 

533
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,389

what's the not using one oh what

534
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
what's the not using one oh what
 

535
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,670
what's the not using one oh what
constant

536
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
constant
 

537
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,230
constant
you say oh a what's oa i said that

538
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
you say oh a what's oa i said that
 

539
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,030
you say oh a what's oa i said that
before

540
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
before
 

541
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,949
before
okay you don't you say love you need to

542
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
okay you don't you say love you need to
 

543
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,310
okay you don't you say love you need to
be confident okay

544
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
be confident okay
 

545
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,110
be confident okay
um if we are you making a copy that's

546
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
um if we are you making a copy that's
 

547
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,150
um if we are you making a copy that's
our n right

548
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
our n right
 

549
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,470
our n right
yeah but we're not no that's that's

550
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
yeah but we're not no that's that's
 

551
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,790
yeah but we're not no that's that's
that's okay like yeah it is

552
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
that's okay like yeah it is
 

553
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,870
that's okay like yeah it is
what's here what's here

554
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880

 

555
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,629

giving you one element in the tunnel

556
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
giving you one element in the tunnel
 

557
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,389
giving you one element in the tunnel
yeah so you can use it in a

558
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
yeah so you can use it in a
 

559
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,509
yeah so you can use it in a
it's a generator right so you can you

560
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
it's a generator right so you can you
 

561
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,470
it's a generator right so you can you
can

562
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
can
 

563
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,110
can
use it in a for loop you can say for i

564
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
use it in a for loop you can say for i
 

565
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,910
use it in a for loop you can say for i
in

566
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
in
 

567
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,910
in
accumulate and then it will give you one

568
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
accumulate and then it will give you one
 

569
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,470
accumulate and then it will give you one
element why is that look because if

570
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
element why is that look because if
 

571
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,150
element why is that look because if
if a contains a minion right

572
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
if a contains a minion right
 

573
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,069
if a contains a minion right
if a contains a minion

574
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079

 

575
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,710

meaning elements then i don't want to

576
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
meaning elements then i don't want to
 

577
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,670
meaning elements then i don't want to
return

578
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
return
 

579
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,230
return
a minion at the same time right maybe i

580
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
a minion at the same time right maybe i
 

581
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,310
a minion at the same time right maybe i
just want to use one at a time right

582
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
just want to use one at a time right
 

583
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,150
just want to use one at a time right
so give me one give me one give me one

584
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
so give me one give me one give me one
 

585
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,750
so give me one give me one give me one
right

586
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
right
 

587
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,110
right
yeah if if we if you give me a hund a

588
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
yeah if if we if you give me a hund a
 

589
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,670
yeah if if we if you give me a hund a
million

590
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:57,680
million
 

591
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,150
million
elements i may not need it i just give

592
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
elements i may not need it i just give
 

593
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,509
elements i may not need it i just give
me one give me one right

594
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
me one give me one right
 

595
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,509
me one give me one right
for example like we can have

596
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
for example like we can have
 

597
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,269
for example like we can have
this may not be a very good example

598
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
this may not be a very good example
 

599
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,110
this may not be a very good example
because we are all we are

600
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
because we are all we are
 

601
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,350
because we are all we are
calculating the entire array at the same

602
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
calculating the entire array at the same
 

603
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,550
calculating the entire array at the same
time right

604
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
time right
 

605
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,310
time right
at once so look we do still remember the

606
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
at once so look we do still remember the
 

607
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,190
at once so look we do still remember the
prime numbers

608
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
prime numbers
 

609
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,829
prime numbers
how many prime numbers are there how

610
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
how many prime numbers are there how
 

611
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,269
how many prime numbers are there how
many prime numbers

612
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
many prime numbers
 

613
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,310
many prime numbers
up to what no i mean

614
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
up to what no i mean
 

615
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,110
up to what no i mean
we in react how many prime numbers are

616
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
we in react how many prime numbers are
 

617
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,750
we in react how many prime numbers are
there

618
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
there
 

619
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,190
there
there's no limit how many about how many

620
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
there's no limit how many about how many
 

621
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,110
there's no limit how many about how many
prime numbers

622
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
prime numbers
 

623
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,629
prime numbers
i know quiet loss is what it's limited

624
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
i know quiet loss is what it's limited
 

625
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,910
i know quiet loss is what it's limited
or

626
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
or
 

627
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,350
or
unlimited it's infinite finance or

628
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
unlimited it's infinite finance or
 

629
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,470
unlimited it's infinite finance or
infinite is it finite

630
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
infinite is it finite
 

631
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,150
infinite is it finite
or infinite

632
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160

 

633
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,150

or unlimited which one

634
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
or unlimited which one
 

635
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,470
or unlimited which one
unlimited i didn't want any of those

636
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
unlimited i didn't want any of those
 

637
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:14,870
unlimited i didn't want any of those
you don't need this one i know i think

638
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880

 

639
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,550

because there are as many as you want

640
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
because there are as many as you want
 

641
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,150
because there are as many as you want
right yeah

642
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
right yeah
 

643
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,269
right yeah
so which one pick one okay for

644
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
so which one pick one okay for
 

645
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,030
so which one pick one okay for
what what's fine finally is that maybe

646
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
what what's fine finally is that maybe
 

647
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,509
what what's fine finally is that maybe
10

648
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
10
 

649
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,509
10
20 you can count it with opposite of

650
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
20 you can count it with opposite of
 

651
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,189
20 you can count it with opposite of
counters

652
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
counters
 

653
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,269
counters
infinite remember infinity yeah

654
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
infinite remember infinity yeah
 

655
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,829
infinite remember infinity yeah
yeah yeah that's the positive infinity

656
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
yeah yeah that's the positive infinity
 

657
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,310
yeah yeah that's the positive infinity
minus

658
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
minus
 

659
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,990
minus
infinity right so which one

660
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
infinity right so which one
 

661
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,829
infinity right so which one
okay which one is no fish come on come

662
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
okay which one is no fish come on come
 

663
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,509
okay which one is no fish come on come
on give me the answer please

664
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:43,519
on give me the answer please
 

665
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,990
on give me the answer please
how many prime numbers i'll go for

666
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
how many prime numbers i'll go for
 

667
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,750
how many prime numbers i'll go for
unlimited i limited count these

668
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
unlimited i limited count these
 

669
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,509
unlimited i limited count these
infinite all these three are the same

670
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
infinite all these three are the same
 

671
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,829
infinite all these three are the same
thing it's okay right

672
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:55,839
thing it's okay right
 

673
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,910
thing it's okay right
yeah it's because it's as many as you

674
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:57,920
yeah it's because it's as many as you
 

675
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,629
yeah it's because it's as many as you
want why are we talking about that okay

676
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639

 

677
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,350

let's say okay let's say

678
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
let's say okay let's say
 

679
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,470
let's say okay let's say
the if yes

680
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
the if yes
 

681
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,550
the if yes
if how can we prove it's unlimited

682
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
if how can we prove it's unlimited
 

683
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,269
if how can we prove it's unlimited
it's very hard but i i i assume look if

684
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
it's very hard but i i i assume look if
 

685
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,269
it's very hard but i i i assume look if
we must be saying

686
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
we must be saying
 

687
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,430
we must be saying
if we assume the prime numbers are

688
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
if we assume the prime numbers are
 

689
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,629
if we assume the prime numbers are
limited okay

690
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
limited okay
 

691
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,750
limited okay
yeah yeah let's say if it's p1

692
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:25,760
yeah yeah let's say if it's p1
 

693
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,030
yeah yeah let's say if it's p1
p2 until pn right yeah

694
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
p2 until pn right yeah
 

695
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,629
p2 until pn right yeah
if it is if it's finite right it's

696
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
if it is if it's finite right it's
 

697
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,189
if it is if it's finite right it's
it's and if there are only n prime

698
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
it's and if there are only n prime
 

699
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,389
it's and if there are only n prime
numbers yeah

700
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
numbers yeah
 

701
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,350
numbers yeah
yeah how about if i times it together

702
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
yeah how about if i times it together
 

703
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,470
yeah how about if i times it together
yeah times it together right that would

704
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
yeah times it together right that would
 

705
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,230
yeah times it together right that would
be not a prime number right because you

706
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
be not a prime number right because you
 

707
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,670
be not a prime number right because you
can find this right

708
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
can find this right
 

709
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,870
can find this right
yeah all right how about plus one

710
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880

 

711
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,110

so if i plus one that becomes a point

712
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
so if i plus one that becomes a point
 

713
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,550
so if i plus one that becomes a point
number right because it

714
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
number right because it
 

715
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,430
number right because it
cannot be divided by any of these prime

716
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
cannot be divided by any of these prime
 

717
00:15:59,440 --> 00:15:59,910
cannot be divided by any of these prime
numbers

718
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
numbers
 

719
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,069
numbers
right you cannot find any number so what

720
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
right you cannot find any number so what
 

721
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,230
right you cannot find any number so what
does it mean i find another one prime

722
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
does it mean i find another one prime
 

723
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,949
does it mean i find another one prime
number which is not p1 to pn

724
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
number which is not p1 to pn
 

725
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,949
number which is not p1 to pn
yeah all right our assumption is that

726
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
yeah all right our assumption is that
 

727
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:11,749
yeah all right our assumption is that
they are only

728
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
they are only
 

729
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,350
they are only
p n they are only n prime numbers but

730
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
p n they are only n prime numbers but
 

731
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,910
p n they are only n prime numbers but
if i multiply them together and plus one

732
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
if i multiply them together and plus one
 

733
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,670
if i multiply them together and plus one
i found a new prime number

734
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
i found a new prime number
 

735
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,710
i found a new prime number
so what does it tell us our assumption

736
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
so what does it tell us our assumption
 

737
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,550
so what does it tell us our assumption
is wrong right so what's our assumption

738
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
is wrong right so what's our assumption
 

739
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,509
is wrong right so what's our assumption
our assumption is there are only n prime

740
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
our assumption is there are only n prime
 

741
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,310
our assumption is there are only n prime
numbers

742
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
numbers
 

743
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,030
numbers
so it's wrong what does it mean the

744
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
so it's wrong what does it mean the
 

745
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,509
so it's wrong what does it mean the
prime numbers are quantities

746
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
prime numbers are quantities
 

747
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,790
prime numbers are quantities
all right is it elegant is it beautiful

748
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
all right is it elegant is it beautiful
 

749
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,150
all right is it elegant is it beautiful
proof

750
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
proof
 

751
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,110
proof
maybe it is yeah this is the opposite

752
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
maybe it is yeah this is the opposite
 

753
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,749
maybe it is yeah this is the opposite
yeah

754
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
yeah
 

755
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,350
yeah
you you you assume something is right

756
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
you you you assume something is right
 

757
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,350
you you you assume something is right
and then you you prove and then you

758
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
and then you you prove and then you
 

759
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,629
and then you you prove and then you
prove you

760
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
prove you
 

761
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,470
prove you
you come back to your approval and then

762
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
you come back to your approval and then
 

763
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,910
you come back to your approval and then
you say oh my my assumption is wrong

764
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
you say oh my my assumption is wrong
 

765
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,629
you say oh my my assumption is wrong
right so the opposite of the assumption

766
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
right so the opposite of the assumption
 

767
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,069
right so the opposite of the assumption
is that

768
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
is that
 

769
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,829
is that
from number of prime numbers are

770
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
from number of prime numbers are
 

771
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,069
from number of prime numbers are
unlimited doesn't make sense

772
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
unlimited doesn't make sense
 

773
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,829
unlimited doesn't make sense
yeah okay so why we talk about

774
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
yeah okay so why we talk about
 

775
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,429
yeah okay so why we talk about
polynomials i want to talk about because

776
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
polynomials i want to talk about because
 

777
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,870
polynomials i want to talk about because
it's unlimited

778
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
it's unlimited
 

779
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,549
it's unlimited
so if i have a function like define

780
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
so if i have a function like define
 

781
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,150
so if i have a function like define
get next prime right

782
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
get next prime right
 

783
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,750
get next prime right
okay next prime give me your next prime

784
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
okay next prime give me your next prime
 

785
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,309
okay next prime give me your next prime
number

786
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
number
 

787
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,630
number
so if it's two the next one will be

788
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
so if it's two the next one will be
 

789
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,429
so if it's two the next one will be
three

790
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
three
 

791
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,429
three
five right because it's unlimited the

792
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
five right because it's unlimited the
 

793
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,430
five right because it's unlimited the
list is always unlimited you can't

794
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
list is always unlimited you can't
 

795
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,470
list is always unlimited you can't
return a list

796
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
return a list
 

797
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,270
return a list
of unlimited right does it make sense do

798
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
of unlimited right does it make sense do
 

799
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,070
of unlimited right does it make sense do
you

800
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
you
 

801
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,150
you
say like if you if you go for two

802
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
say like if you if you go for two
 

803
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,630
say like if you if you go for two
and two is a prime number do you need to

804
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
and two is a prime number do you need to
 

805
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,990
and two is a prime number do you need to
give a

806
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
give a
 

807
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,590
give a
give a prime number so yeah this kind of

808
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
give a prime number so yeah this kind of
 

809
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,070
give a prime number so yeah this kind of
prime

810
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
prime
 

811
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,830
prime
so let i want to use this function yeah

812
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
so let i want to use this function yeah
 

813
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,150
so let i want to use this function yeah
get primed up get next random i want i

814
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
get primed up get next random i want i
 

815
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,990
get primed up get next random i want i
want to do this

816
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
want to do this
 

817
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,430
want to do this
i want to do this y

818
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440

 

819
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,029

y uh let's say um maybe maybe i'll just

820
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
y uh let's say um maybe maybe i'll just
 

821
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,150
y uh let's say um maybe maybe i'll just
do this

822
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
do this
 

823
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,630
do this
uh print

824
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640

 

825
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,310

yeah next next prime number

826
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320

 

827
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,430

get next prime number okay that's it

828
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
get next prime number okay that's it
 

829
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,830
get next prime number okay that's it
i know now we have a loop right 4

830
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
i know now we have a loop right 4
 

831
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,830
i know now we have a loop right 4
i in range

832
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
i in range
 

833
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,830
i in range
might be 10 i want to print the first 10

834
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
might be 10 i want to print the first 10
 

835
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,110
might be 10 i want to print the first 10
prime numbers

836
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
prime numbers
 

837
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,710
prime numbers
right do this right you see so this

838
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
right do this right you see so this
 

839
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,990
right do this right you see so this
is the you will give me uh

840
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
is the you will give me uh
 

841
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,549
is the you will give me uh
it will give me a number every time

842
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
it will give me a number every time
 

843
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,510
it will give me a number every time
right

844
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:37,520
right
 

845
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,510
right
doesn't make sense you'll give me a

846
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
doesn't make sense you'll give me a
 

847
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,270
doesn't make sense you'll give me a
number every time

848
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,280
number every time
 

849
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,549
number every time
because the list at least

850
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
because the list at least
 

851
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,029
because the list at least
maybe maybe i can write it this way

852
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
maybe maybe i can write it this way
 

853
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,470
maybe maybe i can write it this way
maybe it's better

854
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
maybe it's better
 

855
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,830
maybe it's better
for i in in one

856
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:54,840
for i in in one
 

857
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,070
for i in in one
in in get prime

858
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
in in get prime
 

859
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,590
in in get prime
numbers and then i just print i'm going

860
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
numbers and then i just print i'm going
 

861
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,710
numbers and then i just print i'm going
to put in i

862
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
to put in i
 

863
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,070
to put in i
right yes yeah so look these scheduled

864
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
right yes yeah so look these scheduled
 

865
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,750
right yes yeah so look these scheduled
numbers is unlimited

866
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
numbers is unlimited
 

867
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,190
numbers is unlimited
they're unlimited number of prime

868
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,200
they're unlimited number of prime
 

869
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,990
they're unlimited number of prime
numbers but every time i want to i

870
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
numbers but every time i want to i
 

871
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,549
numbers but every time i want to i
i will return the i i will point the

872
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
i will return the i i will point the
 

873
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,909
i will return the i i will point the
point 3.20 so

874
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
point 3.20 so
 

875
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,070
point 3.20 so
here here no nothing

876
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
here here no nothing
 

877
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,150
here here no nothing
so here i was just saying i want to

878
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
so here i was just saying i want to
 

879
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,190
so here i was just saying i want to
yield

880
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
yield
 

881
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,350
yield
yet yeah uh a prime number right

882
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
yet yeah uh a prime number right
 

883
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,789
yet yeah uh a prime number right
yeah yeah here's the prime number right

884
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:30,799
yeah yeah here's the prime number right
 

885
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,710
yeah yeah here's the prime number right
i want to hear the problem number

886
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
i want to hear the problem number
 

887
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,350
i want to hear the problem number
instead of generating a list of the

888
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
instead of generating a list of the
 

889
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,590
instead of generating a list of the
because in this case it will not be very

890
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
because in this case it will not be very
 

891
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,909
because in this case it will not be very
good to generate a list of prime numbers

892
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919
good to generate a list of prime numbers
 

893
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,470
good to generate a list of prime numbers
right

894
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480
right
 

895
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,190
right
because it's unlimited does it make

896
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
because it's unlimited does it make
 

897
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,070
because it's unlimited does it make
sense

898
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
sense
 

899
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,470
sense
but i know the next point number yeah

900
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
but i know the next point number yeah
 

901
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,390
but i know the next point number yeah
i don't know how many more numbers i

902
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
i don't know how many more numbers i
 

903
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,909
i don't know how many more numbers i
need to fit it

904
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:51,919
need to fit it
 

905
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,950
need to fit it
give you because it's unlimited but i

906
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
give you because it's unlimited but i
 

907
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,789
give you because it's unlimited but i
i know the next one doesn't make sense

908
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:56,799
i know the next one doesn't make sense
 

909
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,789
i know the next one doesn't make sense
yeah so that's why the years from

910
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
yeah so that's why the years from
 

911
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,549
yeah so that's why the years from
okay got it okay let's see for today

912
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:02,559
okay got it okay let's see for today
 

913
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,310
okay got it okay let's see for today
we'll talk a little bit more okay

914
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
we'll talk a little bit more okay
 

915
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:11,760
we'll talk a little bit more okay
that's it say bye bye to people
