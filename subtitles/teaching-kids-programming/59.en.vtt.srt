1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:07,909

[Music]

2
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:07,919

 

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,509

okay

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
okay
 

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,629
okay
so today um we talk about

6
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:12,639
so today um we talk about
 

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,910
so today um we talk about
something fundamental in python

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:15,920
something fundamental in python
 

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,269
something fundamental in python
we introduced two functions

10
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
we introduced two functions
 

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,710
we introduced two functions
one is called zip yeah

12
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
one is called zip yeah
 

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,750
one is called zip yeah
is it what's chip i like

14
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
is it what's chip i like
 

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,750
is it what's chip i like
what you have on your code yeah your

16
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
what you have on your code yeah your
 

17
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,349
what you have on your code yeah your
encoder you zip

18
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
encoder you zip
 

19
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,510
encoder you zip
yeah and also a similar

20
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
yeah and also a similar
 

21
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,270
yeah and also a similar
cheap long list okay

22
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,280
cheap long list okay
 

23
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,310
cheap long list okay
so this is deep for short shortest and

24
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
so this is deep for short shortest and
 

25
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,110
so this is deep for short shortest and
then we have

26
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
then we have
 

27
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,990
then we have
two longest longest so what's tip uh

28
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
two longest longest so what's tip uh
 

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,790
two longest longest so what's tip uh
let's see this

30
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
let's see this
 

31
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,229
let's see this
a is one two

32
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
a is one two
 

33
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,670
a is one two
three four a list okay

34
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
three four a list okay
 

35
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,750
three four a list okay
oh and then b equals

36
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
oh and then b equals
 

37
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,790
oh and then b equals
five six seven

38
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
five six seven
 

39
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,470
five six seven
eight nine okay let's add one more

40
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
eight nine okay let's add one more
 

41
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,430
eight nine okay let's add one more
element

42
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
element
 

43
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,830
element
so we have zip

44
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840

 

45
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,030

a b what does it return can you make a

46
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
a b what does it return can you make a
 

47
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,350
a b what does it return can you make a
guess

48
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
guess
 

49
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,870
guess
yeah what does it mean

50
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880

 

51
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,149

no so what does zip do

52
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
no so what does zip do
 

53
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,350
no so what does zip do
can you make a guess close it can you

54
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
can you make a guess close it can you
 

55
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,149
can you make a guess close it can you
make a guess what

56
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
make a guess what
 

57
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,910
make a guess what
zip them two sides meet each other yeah

58
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
zip them two sides meet each other yeah
 

59
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,789
zip them two sides meet each other yeah
yeah yeah so zip your return

60
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
yeah yeah so zip your return
 

61
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,789
yeah yeah so zip your return
it's a generator which i've mentioned

62
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
it's a generator which i've mentioned
 

63
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,109
it's a generator which i've mentioned
later but it eventually will become like

64
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
later but it eventually will become like
 

65
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:39,510
later but it eventually will become like
that

66
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
that
 

67
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,230
that
one comma five this is a two player it's

68
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
one comma five this is a two player it's
 

69
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,030
one comma five this is a two player it's
like a list

70
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
like a list
 

71
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,190
like a list
but it's immutable you're not immutable

72
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
but it's immutable you're not immutable
 

73
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,469
but it's immutable you're not immutable
you know what's this mean no

74
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
you know what's this mean no
 

75
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,510
you know what's this mean no
mutable what does it mean

76
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
mutable what does it mean
 

77
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,830
mutable what does it mean
mutable means the change you can change

78
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
mutable means the change you can change
 

79
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,709
mutable means the change you can change
it immutable means you can't change it

80
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
it immutable means you can't change it
 

81
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,149
it immutable means you can't change it
yeah one five it's like a list you can

82
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
yeah one five it's like a list you can
 

83
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,950
yeah one five it's like a list you can
if this is you can change it you can say

84
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
if this is you can change it you can say
 

85
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,149
if this is you can change it you can say
if this is

86
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
if this is
 

87
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,589
if this is
a0 equals 2 then you can change it you

88
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
a0 equals 2 then you can change it you
 

89
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,869
a0 equals 2 then you can change it you
what does this happen when a 0 equals 2

90
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
what does this happen when a 0 equals 2
 

91
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,630
what does this happen when a 0 equals 2
then you can change it yeah

92
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
then you can change it yeah
 

93
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,630
then you can change it yeah
yeah but at least you can't change it

94
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
yeah but at least you can't change it
 

95
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,910
yeah but at least you can't change it
one is a 1

96
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
one is a 1
 

97
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,150
one is a 1
5 you can't do this because it's

98
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
5 you can't do this because it's
 

99
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,589
5 you can't do this because it's
immutable okay

100
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:21,599
immutable okay
 

101
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,470
immutable okay
so why it's just the symbol this is

102
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
so why it's just the symbol this is
 

103
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,990
so why it's just the symbol this is
called tupa

104
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
called tupa
 

105
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,030
called tupa
t-u-p-l means

106
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
t-u-p-l means
 

107
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,070
t-u-p-l means
okay so one five comma

108
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
okay so one five comma
 

109
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,280
okay so one five comma
two six comma one what's

110
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,290
two six comma one what's
 

111
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:44,949
two six comma one what's
[Music]

112
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959

 

113
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,630

so this is zip to get it so you take one

114
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
so this is zip to get it so you take one
 

115
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,550
so this is zip to get it so you take one
animal from each

116
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
animal from each
 

117
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,229
animal from each
and then you put it as a two part a

118
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
and then you put it as a two part a
 

119
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,630
and then you put it as a two part a
group and then

120
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
group and then
 

121
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,470
group and then
chip longest can you make a guess what's

122
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
chip longest can you make a guess what's
 

123
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,149
chip longest can you make a guess what's
the difference between cheap longest

124
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159

 

125
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:08,390

and a b what does everything

126
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400

 

127
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,949

no four a we got a four a here but zip

128
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
no four a we got a four a here but zip
 

129
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,589
no four a we got a four a here but zip
longest

130
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
longest
 

131
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,070
longest
you were according to the next longest

132
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
you were according to the next longest
 

133
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,750
you were according to the next longest
which is four nine

134
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
which is four nine
 

135
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,309
which is four nine
no no no you're quite close so you

136
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
no no no you're quite close so you
 

137
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,070
no no no you're quite close so you
eventually will become a lung here

138
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
eventually will become a lung here
 

139
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,070
eventually will become a lung here
because there's no element here yeah

140
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
because there's no element here yeah
 

141
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,430
because there's no element here yeah
then you'll become a nung knight

142
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
then you'll become a nung knight
 

143
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,550
then you'll become a nung knight
okay yeah it doesn't make sense yes

144
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
okay yeah it doesn't make sense yes
 

145
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,589
okay yeah it doesn't make sense yes
longest add one more animal okay okay so

146
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
longest add one more animal okay okay so
 

147
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:31,990
longest add one more animal okay okay so
let's

148
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
let's
 

149
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,830
let's
implement these two functions okay you

150
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
implement these two functions okay you
 

151
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,070
implement these two functions okay you
can do no none

152
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
can do no none
 

153
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,630
can do no none
yeah and then it's opposite ba if it's

154
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
yeah and then it's opposite ba if it's
 

155
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,630
yeah and then it's opposite ba if it's
zip longest ba

156
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
zip longest ba
 

157
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,390
zip longest ba
yeah so like defined let's do a zip

158
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
yeah so like defined let's do a zip
 

159
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,550
yeah so like defined let's do a zip
function a b so first of all we want to

160
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
function a b so first of all we want to
 

161
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,670
function a b so first of all we want to
blend the length yeah

162
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
blend the length yeah
 

163
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,030
blend the length yeah
the length length will become

164
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
the length length will become
 

165
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,070
the length length will become
mean of these two right

166
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
mean of these two right
 

167
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,910
mean of these two right
lens a and comma lens b so now

168
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
lens a and comma lens b so now
 

169
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,270
lens a and comma lens b so now
i will have this small list yeah

170
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
i will have this small list yeah
 

171
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,990
i will have this small list yeah
and i can have this the answer if i

172
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
and i can have this the answer if i
 

173
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,190
and i can have this the answer if i
convert it to a list

174
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
convert it to a list
 

175
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,830
convert it to a list
yeah for i in

176
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840
yeah for i in
 

177
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,629
yeah for i in
range aira right

178
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
range aira right
 

179
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,150
range aira right
yes because the mod is the answer

180
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
yes because the mod is the answer
 

181
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,830
yes because the mod is the answer
drop a pen open what

182
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
drop a pen open what
 

183
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,150
drop a pen open what
a tuper yeah you can another bracket and

184
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
a tuper yeah you can another bracket and
 

185
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:34,120
a tuper yeah you can another bracket and
wow

186
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,130

 

187

[Music]

188
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160

 

189
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,070

and then

190
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
and then
 

191
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,510
and then
return answer yeah this is returning at

192
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
return answer yeah this is returning at
 

193
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,870
return answer yeah this is returning at
least but in the

194
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
least but in the
 

195
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,510
least but in the
in python it's not retaining a piece in

196
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
in python it's not retaining a piece in
 

197
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,670
in python it's not retaining a piece in
person you if you do it this way

198
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
person you if you do it this way
 

199
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,830
person you if you do it this way
it's not a list you have to convert it

200
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
it's not a list you have to convert it
 

201
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,990
it's not a list you have to convert it
because this is called the generator

202
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
because this is called the generator
 

203
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,390
because this is called the generator
so basically we are not returning here

204
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
so basically we are not returning here
 

205
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,749
so basically we are not returning here
because we know returning we are

206
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
because we know returning we are
 

207
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,350
because we know returning we are
returning the entire list

208
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
returning the entire list
 

209
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,430
returning the entire list
this this thing will return one at a

210
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
this this thing will return one at a
 

211
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,029
this this thing will return one at a
time so we remove these

212
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
time so we remove these
 

213
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,350
time so we remove these
and we don't need this and then we don't

214
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
and we don't need this and then we don't
 

215
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,189
and we don't need this and then we don't
need it but we we are retaining that so

216
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
need it but we we are retaining that so
 

217
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,670
need it but we we are retaining that so
we call it another keyword called yet

218
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
we call it another keyword called yet
 

219
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,070
we call it another keyword called yet
what's

220
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
what's
 

221
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,590
what's
yet why yeah yeah so every time

222
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
yet why yeah yeah so every time
 

223
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,670
yet why yeah yeah so every time
i give it yeah yeah i give you one

224
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
i give it yeah yeah i give you one
 

225
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,150
i give it yeah yeah i give you one
element and then you can use it as

226
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
element and then you can use it as
 

227
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,629
element and then you can use it as
you know you can use this for i

228
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639

 

229
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,469

and then every time you give me a

230
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
and then every time you give me a
 

231
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,909
and then every time you give me a
element okay

232
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
element okay
 

233
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,350
element okay
the longest okay now the longest one

234
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
the longest okay now the longest one
 

235
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,230
the longest okay now the longest one
so i changed this to longest yeah what's

236
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
so i changed this to longest yeah what's
 

237
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,270
so i changed this to longest yeah what's
your turn here

238
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280

 

239
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,390

but now

240
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400

 

241
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,790

now we need to do this let's store it a

242
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
now we need to do this let's store it a
 

243
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,590
now we need to do this let's store it a
a equals

244
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
a equals
 

245
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,350
a equals
in that a equals a i

246
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
in that a equals a i
 

247
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,790
in that a equals a i
if i smaller than

248
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
if i smaller than
 

249
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,830
if i smaller than
length a as

250
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
length a as
 

251
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,110
length a as
noun right yeah because

252
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
noun right yeah because
 

253
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,990
noun right yeah because
this i may be bigger than the length

254
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
this i may be bigger than the length
 

255
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,110
this i may be bigger than the length
then we have to

256
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
then we have to
 

257
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,870
then we have to
put it as noun and bb equals

258
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
put it as noun and bb equals
 

259
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,150
put it as noun and bb equals
b i is i

260
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
b i is i
 

261
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,660
b i is i
smaller than length b as what

262
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:19,670

let's make a guess okay you see

358
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
let's make a guess okay you see
 

359
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,190
let's make a guess okay you see
it adds one two more elements four now

360
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
it adds one two more elements four now
 

361
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,070
it adds one two more elements four now
five now

362
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
five now
 

363
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,110
five now
right you use now to fill the space

364
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
right you use now to fill the space
 

365
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,110
right you use now to fill the space
yeah correct okay

366
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
yeah correct okay
 

367
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,710
yeah correct okay
uh okay let's do this

368
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
uh okay let's do this
 

369
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,949

407
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,910
uh list my zip
a b okay and now we can print

408
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
a b okay and now we can print
 

409
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,110
a b okay and now we can print
the same as the the other side okay at

410
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
the same as the the other side okay at

okay now let's second function

418
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
okay now let's second function
 

419
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,230
okay now let's second function
which is my zip longest okay so you tell

420
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
which is my zip longest okay so you tell
 

421
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,870
which is my zip longest okay so you tell
me what to do okay

422
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
me what to do okay
 

423
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,990
me what to do okay
define my zip longest

424
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
define my zip longest
 

425
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,269
define my zip longest
a b okay so what what's that a equals

426
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
a b okay so what what's that a equals
 

427
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:52,470
a b okay so what what's that a equals
what

429
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,110

instead of minimal yeah max and i'm

430
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
instead of minimal yeah max and i'm
 

431
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,790
instead of minimal yeah max and i'm
getting the length of the

432
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
getting the length of the
 

433
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,350
getting the length of the

now we got a a equals if it's smaller ai

438
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
now we got a a equals if it's smaller ai
 

439

ah the lens another b okay not lens

456
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
ah the lens another b okay not lens
 

457
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,670
ah the lens another b okay not lens
there's no aoe there okay okay that's a

yeah you see doesn't make
what's the difference between cheap and

function we
 

477
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,829

longer which is uh could be a could be b

506
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
longer which is uh could be a could be b
 

507
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,030
longer which is uh could be a could be b
yeah it's always the longest

508
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040

 

509
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,230

do you understand this you have to

510
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
do you understand this you have to
 

511
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,069
do you understand this you have to
keyword if

512
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
keyword if
 

513
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,350
keyword if
it's not your keyboard if if okay let us

514
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
it's not your keyboard if if okay let us
 

515
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,389
it's not your keyboard if if okay let us
do this okay

516
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
do this okay
 

517
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,430
do this okay
look if if this

518
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
look if if this
 

519
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,629
look if if this
is not one two three okay if b equals

520
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
is not one two three okay if b equals
 

521
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,430
is not one two three okay if b equals
one

522
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
one
 

523
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,629
one
and then if you do this a and b you you

524
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
and then if you do this a and b you you
 

525
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,550
and then if you do this a and b you you
will have an object iterator because

526
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
will have an object iterator because
 

527
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,389
will have an object iterator because
it's not a list and then you have to

528
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
it's not a list and then you have to
 

529
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,389
it's not a list and then you have to
tell it for example you you have to tell

530
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
tell it for example you you have to tell
 

531
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,470
tell it for example you you have to tell
it like uh

532
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
it like uh
 

533
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,189
it like uh
for you can convert it to list or you

534
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:51,199
for you can convert it to list or you
 

535
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:51,829
for you can convert it to list or you
can do this

536
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
can do this
 

537
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,350
can do this
for i in zip a b

538
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
for i in zip a b
 

539
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,790
for i in zip a b
and then you can print i uh do you need

540
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
and then you can print i uh do you need
 

541
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,350
and then you can print i uh do you need
to

542
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
to
 

543
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,509
to
print the i yes does it make sense

544
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
print the i yes does it make sense
 

545
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,430
print the i yes does it make sense
yes yeah when you're using a

546
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440
yes yeah when you're using a
 

547
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,590
yes yeah when you're using a
generator you can put it in the for loop

548
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
generator you can put it in the for loop
 

549
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,590
generator you can put it in the for loop
okay otherwise if you want to

550
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
okay otherwise if you want to
 

551
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,590
okay otherwise if you want to
convert it to a list you can do this c

552
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
convert it to a list you can do this c
 

553
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,509
convert it to a list you can do this c
equals list

554
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
equals list
 

555
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,870
equals list
zip a b and then c is the list

556
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
zip a b and then c is the list
 

557
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,870
zip a b and then c is the list
yeah got it yes yes okay

558
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
yeah got it yes yes okay
 

559
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,230
yeah got it yes yes okay
okay okay

560
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240

 

561
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,150

okay good job today good job today turn

562
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
okay good job today good job today turn
 

563
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:38,949
okay good job today good job today turn

564
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959

 

565
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,360
