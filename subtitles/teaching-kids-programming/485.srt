1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
we are given a string so we want to find

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,080
out the longest

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,400
longest substring

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,519
with no repeat characters no repeat

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,839
characters substring continuous

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,680
no repeat characters so means we ought

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,000
to find out the longest the substring

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,960
contains only unique characters so look

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,680
at this

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,680
which one is the longest substring with

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,680
no repeat characters

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,640
yeah i

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,559
that's it

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,480
yeah and we can't get this yeah because

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,480
i is included yes repeat it okay

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,960
oh this is longer yes this is more so

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,200
this is longer

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,039
anymore this is uh five characters

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,680
anymore than that

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,120
okay substring continues subsequent on

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,800
the other hand doesn't have to be

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,640
continuous the substring has to be

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,800
continuous and then the container the

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,039
substring does not contain duplicate

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,760
numbers all the characters in substring

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,440
is unique so for substring we can prove

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,040
us if we want to prove for the

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,560
substitution what's the time complexity

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,080
you know so let's say

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,880
the substring

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:15,439
could be c n1 plus cn2 okay cn1

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,400
picking one out of n means that the

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,560
substring of size one picking two out of

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
m means the substring contains more than

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,600
one characters

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,799
right this is the total number of

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,439
substrings

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,920
right picking two what does it mean to

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,320
we pick one index for the left and we

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,400
pick one index from the right so that's

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,640
the total number of a substring that

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,400
contains more than one characters let's

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,400
the total number of substring contains

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,560
one character there are n possibilities

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,159
right so if we

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,240
compute this this is n plus n times n

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,320
minus one divided by two and that's

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,200
going to take n

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,280
times n plus one divided by two

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,119
n times at this if we're going to proof

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,360
of it that's going to take the o n

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,360
square

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,439
we start from the first note and then

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
check after

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,319
check that long check how long it could

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,400
be and then go to the network and start

57
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,959
from there and then drop off not very

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,520
convinced then

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,040
if the size is n how many substrings

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,640
look this is the total number of

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,440
assumptions

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,760
how do we check each substring

63
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,760
okay abc how do we check how many

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,200
substrings are there

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,239
six huh

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,840
one

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,440
a seven

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,319
a b

69
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,720
c

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:43,599
c c a b a b b c b c a b c a b c

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,160
okay empty okay suppose we don't want to

72
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,840
include how do we proof of this

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:54,239
if there are n so for

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,800
it you just do one letters range n you

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,680
just do one letter and then two letter

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,120
and then three letters

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,080
yeah that could be one way yeah yeah

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,120
yeah and by doing this sliding window

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,680
thing

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,080
wait look sliding window two pointers

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,760
okay look this is the

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,200
i look

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,959
for j

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,280
in range

85
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,560
we start from i up to n

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,319
right look

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,280
that's what i'm saying we prove us that

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,000
this i this is the left j

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,879
is right so the substring is what

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,920
s

91
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,840
i t j yeah

92
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,040
this is the way to prove us yeah we come

93
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,640
coco

94
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,680
what does this mean what are we doing

95
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,680
here the i and j what's i and j index

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,400
index yes i

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,560
i zero to one

98
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,599
one two n yeah

99
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
and

100
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,159
is

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,080
is i

102
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,879
thorian yes so what do we have now

103
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,640
two indexes yeah good great job two

104
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,640
index and what do we have is the two

105
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,640
index this mean is i to j plus one

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,920
so to j plus one

107
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,400
j increases j i j

108
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,959
j so okay so we have index i we want to

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,480
find the substring from i to j and this

110
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,480
is the substring okay got it

111
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,720
and once we have this substring

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,600
then we can check if it has this

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,720
unique all the unique numbers right yeah

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,759
unique carry so we can have if check if

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,400
f function if this is the this is the

116
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,560
valid string without repeating

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,680
characters then we can remember the

118
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,240
length answer equals max answer

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,520
and the length would be j minus i plus

120
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
one okay

121
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,280
yeah

122
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,919
answer at the beginning equals zero so

123
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,680
the f function define f function how do

124
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,919
we check if a string contains all the

125
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
unique numbers or unique characters

126
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,199
except

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,240
whether i'm using set wow you number

128
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,400
yeah we return lens because i got ingo

129
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,639
and mn retention a equals lens

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,840
well set a right

131
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,840
right look

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,320
we're converting the characters

133
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,120
converting the string into the set and

134
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,280
then we're checking the size right so if

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,360
the size look

136
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,560
eric we convert into

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,960
the set it's also eric right

138
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,199
and then both sides is for how about

139
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,759
look e-r-r-i-c

140
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,960
we're converting to set

141
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,400
we convert you to set what do we have

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,039
e-r-i-c

143
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,039
the size this is four the size this is

144
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,840
five so this is not equal

145
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,840
all right yes

146
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,600
okay so the time context as we said if

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,160
we want to prove us to the substring

148
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,400
this is o n o n square

149
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,800
and we're checking the substring

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,400
checking the substring oh n right so

151
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:01,440
time convex is o and qb

152
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,440
okay so we just let's avoid this one

153
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,000
e-r-i-c-r-y-a-a-a-n okay how do you use

154
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,039
the two-pointer thing right look we have

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,639
a

156
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,639
look at this is the

157
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,360
important part important part of today

158
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,680
look look we have a window yeah at the

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,840
beginning e

160
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,800
not the window is empty at the beginning

161
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,680
so we put an e in it right the e is not

162
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,280
in in that window so we put it pretty

163
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,919
easy right

164
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,479
then we we go to the right right look we

165
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,840
can expand to the right as long as this

166
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:39,440
character is not in the window so

167
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:43,360
the maximum is e-r-i-c okay now look

168
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,160
over r look eyes already in the window

169
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,680
so we cut it

170
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,599
yeah i see

171
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,759
so look i have a pointer to the left i

172
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,840
have a pointer to the right and now i'm

173
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,199
pointing i'm now from here this is the

174
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,039
new level character is r right look

175
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,599
because i this r

176
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,840
is already in a window right so i cannot

177
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,639
go further without

178
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,319
moving the left pointer so look i try to

179
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,360
take the e out

180
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,680
okay

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,160
look and then this is still in the

182
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,599
window so i need to take this out

183
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,639
right so then i can put this in i see r

184
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,680
y

185
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,280
okay

186
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,360
and then a look unique okay now a yeah

187
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,000
a is in the window right this is this is

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,880
the kind of window so how do we do it

189
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,120
we take the left we take it from the

190
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,880
left take it from the left it waits it

191
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,599
waits and here

192
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,199
this a is not in the window okay

193
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,680
why can't we do this because substring

194
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,599
is continuous so we keep doing that and

195
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,440
we record the maximum very good noise we

196
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,520
look at the maximum

197
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,160
length of the window

198
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,160
because each window is a substring

199
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,599
yeah how

200
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,960
are

201
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,960
you now we know

202
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,639
y

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,680
okay o is in this window right

204
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,759
so i erase the left

205
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,759
oh it's still in the window where he's

206
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,319
listening okay he's not in the window i

207
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,840
i put this in put this in okay so we

208
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,120
remember yeah

209
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,280
do you see how this how how this works

210
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,479
yeah but don't you have this like high

211
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,000
school

212
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,960
point because when when you have a

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,800
uh

214
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,919
another visiting

215
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,599
uh letter that is already in your window

216
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,039
yeah and

217
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,399
because it's like the windows that

218
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,440
it's it's uh seven so don't you record

219
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,120
that

220
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,360
good question yes

221
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,600
so every time we need to remember the

222
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,839
length of the current window the size of

223
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,440
the calendar and we remember the maximum

224
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,760
right yeah

225
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,440
okay so okay let me implement this and

226
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
then you tell me what's the time and

227
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,440
space complexity i know okay and then

228
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,040
you need to think about what have you

229
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
learned today remember

230
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,440
this is

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,720
one always the final question of the day

232
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,200
okay

233
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,200
define okay this longest

234
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,399
blah blah blah okay

235
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,600
s

236
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,959
so n we've got the size s the left

237
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,880
equals y equals zero we're gonna answer

238
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,519
to store the longest all right and we

239
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,760
got a window which is the set right hash

240
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,320
table the notebook yeah contains only

241
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,440
unique numbers so while the right

242
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,000
pointer

243
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,640
is not reaching the end right

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,680
so then we need to check wire

245
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,959
s

246
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,160
r

247
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,959
is in

248
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,560
if we see in the window right if the

249
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,360
character added

250
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,519
right

251
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,279
e r i c r y if this is in the window but

252
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,800
we do move it so

253
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,680
screen dot remove

254
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,880
if sr is in the window we remove this

255
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,360
character which is sl right

256
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,160
and then air plus equal one and then now

257
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,600
we have to win the at s

258
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,200
r okay

259
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,880
your question is we need to remember

260
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,959
right so now the size of it yeah answer

261
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,160
equals maximum

262
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,800
answer

263
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,560
the length of the window right length of

264
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,519
the window

265
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,920
and then

266
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,760
ah plus equal one at the end we need to

267
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,600
move the left pointer right and then

268
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,620
return answer what's the timing and

269
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,399
space complexity

270
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,200
[Music]

271
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,240
what's the space from last week

272
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,800
why is it going ah every time from the

273
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,120
left in the iteration is incremented one

274
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,000
right so it goes to the right the left

275
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,480
also increments to one way right

276
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,880
look the air does not go bad

277
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,920
the maximum maximum number of the

278
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,480
iteration is n plus

279
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,600
n right look so it's all

280
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,279
to n which is o and i

281
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,880
make sense look there are an and

282
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,720
airpointers

283
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,320
they only go

284
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,240
to the right they do not go back

285
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,000
let's make it all aware the space

286
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,600
convexity

287
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
what's that

288
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,839
oh n what's the thing you learned today

289
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,839
what have you learned today

290
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,720
don't deception without repeating

291
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,079
characters so what's the approach you

292
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,440
know today

293
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,480
so i talk about twos and two points

294
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,160
yeah we're done wow you're listening

295
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,519
to twitter what's the term complexity

296
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,519
for two for us

297
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,640
cubic

298
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,279
yeah because o and square to proof of

299
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,320
the substring and o n time to check if a

300
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,200
string

301
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,880
is a contains unique numbers what's two

302
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,240
pointer how do we use the two pointer

303
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,240
sliding window to solve this problem

304
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,320
i'll give you another example a b c

305
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,279
b a b d e okay

306
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,920
we just we just make our window bigger

307
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,800
until we have okay look okay so

308
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,800
so i'm nothing

309
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,320
okay now okay so now what do we do with

310
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,680
this abc when b is the winner window so

311
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,079
what do we do

312
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,920
look the column window is a b c b is in

313
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,200
the window so what do we do so that

314
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,000
means so that means we record it and l

315
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,279
moves this forward to b okay now

316
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,160
b is

317
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,720
okay and now okay cb hey right the

318
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,360
window is cba right

319
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,240
and then we move the left yeah

320
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,560
c yeah and then b yeah

321
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,000
and now what's next abd

322
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,839
abd right next yeah in every iteration

323
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,560
we need to remember look this is to

324
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,800
remember the maximum size of the current

325
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,320
window okay yeah okay

326
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,320
okay good job that's it for today bye

327
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,680
you
