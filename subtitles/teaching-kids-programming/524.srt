1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
hello Miss Larry are you right

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,420
so Eric and Ryan right they arrived in a

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,320
city like Cambridge right for example

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,960
Eric you arrive in a city like arrive

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,779
yeah you know you know for example if

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,220
you're going to go to Cambridge to have

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,300
fun

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,820
okay so let's say Paris

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,030
visit Paris and Ryan wants to visit

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,100
Paris as well yeah

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,100
[Music]

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,840
that's okay you don't need to speak

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,559
French to be there right okay so the

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,739
point is that for example if you arrive

15
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:46,079
arrive at tens of March

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,620
all right and then you leave you

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,239
departure at the 15th of March

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,500
okay

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,440
yeah

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,100
and Ryan somehow

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,480
arrived at 12th of March

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,820
and leave at 22 of March okay

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,380
so we want to find out how many days

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,320
you're both in Paris

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,420
and what are those three days

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,520
12 13 14

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,000
sleep

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,840
12 13 14.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,340
so 15. you post that in Paris make sense

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,979
yeah yeah so 12 13 14 15 right but not

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,380
16. on 15 what happened you're still in

32
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,659
Paris all right you'll probably take a

33
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,520
plan but you're in Paris

34
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,280
okay so the question is asking how many

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,920
days you both are in Paris in the same

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,840
place yeah so four days you just need to

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,380
tell me these four days okay so for

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,720
Simplicity we're assuming the year is

39
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,000
not a leap year

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,240
what's leap year

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,399
the leap year affects only on how many

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,100
days on February right if it's leap year

43
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,900
how many days in February

44
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,340
um

45
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,860
[Music]

46
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,780
okay if it's not a leap year it's 28 am

47
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,239
I yeah

48
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,879
so for Simplicity it's not a leap year

49
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,580
we're given four days one with your

50
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,739
arrival day

51
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,720
arrive departure days and violence

52
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,760
arrive departure days how would you

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,560
calculate how many days you first stay

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,000
in the same place

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:34,340
logically I mean but for this one I

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,340
I just really did

57
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,520
[Music]

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,379
you can

59
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,760
uh well I can well

60
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,120
I don't know

61
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:53,519
to hold you how do you notice there this

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:58,440
this is like Eric arrives early and

63
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:03,360
and make sure that both at least one day

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:05,340
oh is it because with the like zero days

65
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,400
yeah it could be zero days for example

66
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,980
like you know you are here and lying

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,959
here all right in here right

68
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,120
so basically we are calculating the

69
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,819
intersection of two intervals right yeah

70
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,819
the interval look this is you Eric this

71
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:23,040
is you Ryan could be here or here yeah

72
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,200
how many possibilities so this is you

73
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,980
right Eric how many possibilities of

74
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,420
Ryan Ryan could be here

75
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,000
here

76
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,560
here

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,319
or here

78
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,959
here or here or here am I

79
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,819
this is my drawing do you understand my

80
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,739
drawing here this is the bottom one

81
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,860
thing at the top one

82
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:53,940
oh yes you're right yes okay

83
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:57,060
good spot so look this case

84
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,360
it's yellow days right am I

85
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,560
and all these we can calculate the same

86
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,480
way all these

87
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,819
of all the intersection what's the

88
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,920
intersection look here in this case it's

89
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:11,720
the least space in this case

90
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,280
is here here

91
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,540
and here

92
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,199
right

93
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,479
so basically this question is asking the

94
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,100
asking for an intercession home the the

95
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,919
lens of the intersection for two

96
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,380
intervals right because you arrive and

97
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,919
departure let's say interval right but

98
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,940
how do we go now the intervals how do we

99
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:36,600
convert a date

100
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:40,440
for example the date 10th of March is 03

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,860
10 right uh 15th of March

102
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,100
obviously 15 this is a stream how do we

103
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,860
convert these into a interval put it

104
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,139
this way how do we measure the date

105
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,639
between these two how do we measure how

106
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,500
do we calculate the date remember we

107
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,940
talk about how do we calculate the date

108
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,880
between two dates of the same year uh

109
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,340
if it's the same month you can

110
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,380
that's a good one but if it's not a

111
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,660
seven months what happened

112
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:15,900
if it's like what how many days between

113
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:21,060
30s of January to

114
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:24,419
25 of March how many days between

115
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:30,380
if it's a not a leap year if they are 28

116
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:33,600
days in February uh that would be one

117
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,620
the B

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,620
um let's see

119
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,759
54

120
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,699
how do you calculate 54.

121
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,860
killing it you just count it yeah you

122
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,440
can count it well computer how do we eat

123
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,259
that computer remember we can as look

124
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,060
look at these two days look I'm saying

125
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,880
yeah this is the beginning of the year

126
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,600
and in January 36 yeah

127
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,960
20th March 25 is here okay so is this

128
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:08,360
enough hint how many days between this

129
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,360
so how we can do it by what

130
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,360
how many days so how do we calculate it

131
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,400
minus yes so first of all we need to

132
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,639
calculate the number of days from the

133
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,699
beginning January 1st to this Thursday

134
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,580
and then we calculate the days from

135
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,780
January 1st to the second day I will do

136
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,539
the subtraction

137
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,780
is it simpler than your approach

138
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:37,620
all right is it simple

139
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,259
yes be confident it's simpler okay this

140
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,660
is not a question this is this is just

141
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,520
saying it's simpler okay we want to find

142
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,919
out the number of days between two dates

143
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,720
in a calendar year

144
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,520
all right then we can do this

145
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,400
subtraction

146
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,960
by calculating the number of days since

147
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,300
the first of January and we do the

148
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,180
subtraction right that would be easier

149
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,160
that's the way okay otherwise what would

150
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,860
you do you just count okay how many days

151
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,979
until the end of January plus the whole

152
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,740
month of February plus the days

153
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:13,560
in March right you need to do these

154
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,800
things it's complicated so this is

155
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,919
simpler okay then we can convert this

156
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,780
take the numbers then look for example

157
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,220
like we can convert the base numbers I

158
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,000
know we just have to check if the

159
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,020
departure day of Eric

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,360
today I'm Ryan

161
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:37,259
is before the arrival day of Eric or if

162
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,780
the arrival date of Ryan is after the

163
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:42,539
departure date of Eric then there is no

164
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,360
intersection then we return zero right

165
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:48,360
so what's the intercession is this bit

166
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:52,520
right is this bit so we want to get

167
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:56,039
these speeds this this bit is the

168
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,220
departure day the minimum of departure

169
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,220
day

170
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:05,099
and minus

171
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,500
the maximum of arrival date right yeah

172
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,360
okay this is one scenario okay how about

173
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,220
this

174
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,380
the minimum of the departure day is this

175
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,720
minus the maximum of departure day is

176
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,160
listed right it also works and how about

177
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,280
this

178
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,680
the minimum of departure day is this one

179
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,139
the maximum of arrival that is this one

180
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,500
so we minus

181
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,640
this one this one if there is a

182
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,200
intersection there are only three

183
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,560
possibilities how to calculate the

184
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,680
intersection the minimum of the

185
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,080
departure date minimum Risk 2 which is

186
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,240
this one oh and minus the maximum of

187
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,620
these two which is this one the minimum

188
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,220
of

189
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,500
departure day this one minus the maximum

190
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,019
of arrival date is this one right it's

191
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,720
listed the minimum of departure day

192
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,920
which is this one minus the maximum of

193
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,100
arrival day

194
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,440
this one which is this big

195
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,800
okay so first of all we need to know the

196
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,530
days right Define uh Define the days

197
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,320
Eric Eric

198
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,080
[Music]

199
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,760
one every two

200
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,260
volume one

201
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,940
volume two one is the Arrival Day two is

202
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,620
the departure day okay and first of all

203
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,700
we need to get the day of the month so

204
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:32,100
we we say months my state equals

205
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:33,600
for 31 28 31 yeah Etc right and this is

206
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,120
the number of days in each calendar

207
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,279
month so now we need to define a

208
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,500
function define the function f State

209
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:44,279
date

210
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,339
will be in the format of least uh the

211
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,680
month contacting it by a hyphen and the

212
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,959
day now we need to get it split this

213
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,760
yeah we need to split it by the

214
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,080
hyphen

215
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,000
so

216
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,200
the month

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,820
s months the date

218
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,839
equals

219
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,779
Theta split

220
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,240
then we talk about the split function

221
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,100
and we need to map it into integer

222
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,680
because it's a character we map it into

223
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,620
integer so it becomes uh integer right

224
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,080
look 15th of March so how many days

225
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,720
since the January

226
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,339
how many days since the generator 15th

227
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,440
of March

228
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,040
how do you get it look how much is this

229
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,980
one January February March here

230
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,440
so how would you do it

231
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:38,279
this is the first two I did together and

232
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,040
in 15. well done so we sum up the base

233
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,100
of the previous months and plus the day

234
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,459
of this month right return

235
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,459
some for Simplicity or you can just put

236
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:53,459
a zero here right so we can sum

237
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:55,500
empty up to

238
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,660
the month

239
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,720
right up to the month

240
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,540
then you will sum up the days in the

241
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,399
previous month plus the T right we need

242
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,540
to find out if there's an intersection

243
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,740
right

244
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,620
so

245
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:14,220
if Arabic

246
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:18,000
this is Eric one right this is Eric too

247
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:21,120
this is Ryan one lion two lion one lion

248
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,100
two so if Y and two

249
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,700
if Ryan to

250
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:33,420
okay so let me just write this E1

251
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:38,700
E1 E2 R1 R2 okay so if

252
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,480
so if R2 smaller than E1 or R1 is bigger

253
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,260
than

254
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,440
R1 is bigger than E2 then return

255
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,820
zero let's write and see here right hand

256
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,279
is here you are here there is no

257
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,160
intersection between zero otherwise

258
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:56,760
we can we need to do this absolute value

259
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:01,620
so we want to get a minimum of f

260
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:07,700
this is E1 E2 R1 R2 we want to get the

261
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:13,019
minimum of least departure day so E2

262
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:16,940
f r 2 minus the maximum of arrival date

263
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:19,500
which is f e 1

264
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,540
F R1 what

265
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,279
and then we have the plus one for the

266
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,880
end days right look

267
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,700
why do we need plus one match old one to

268
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,860
match O2 how many days

269
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,200
two days right so the plus one is

270
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,520
increasing okay

271
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,459
do you understand this approach

272
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,640
[Music]

273
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:45,959
so what yeah

274
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,420
R1 and RT and e r e are mainly a one and

275
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:50,779
E2

276
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:56,579
R1 and E one are the

277
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:58,920
uh they arrive and and e t and RT are we

278
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,839
going to leave yes

279
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,700
um

280
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,399
MD is the month

281
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,220
uh

282
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,800
every amount of days in every month

283
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,000
because

284
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,639
um

285
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,500
okay what's a key takeaway for this

286
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,060
approach what have you learned from this

287
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,399
approach

288
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,519
well

289
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,519
yeah

290
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:29,040
so you

291
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:33,740
please like that

292
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:38,100
minimum like starting day

293
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:40,079
and and and see the difference of it

294
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,620
like

295
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,959
minimum leaving day and the maximum

296
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,639
starting day weather yes the

297
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,920
intercession this video so we want to

298
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,560
get the minimum of the departure day

299
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,779
which is this one and the maximum was

300
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,639
the arrival day which is this one and we

301
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:59,760
do the subtractions this one it works

302
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:03,180
for these three scenarios at least one

303
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,800
this one or this one left I thought

304
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,839
obviously we have to check if there's

305
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,899
intersection okay so here this is the

306
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,480
day we we have to do this F function for

307
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:15,720
you as well right so maybe we can save

308
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,899
this variable yeah we can save save this

309
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,240
well but day one day two you know

310
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:24,120
okay okay so that's one way but a second

311
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,700
way yeah very similar right and I'm

312
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,300
going to talk straight away and it's

313
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:36,000
very convenient how many days in a year

314
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:39,120
uh 355 and 356 on Olympia okay in this

315
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,660
case it's not Olympia right so it's 365.

316
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,100
so how about if I probably this is 365

317
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:51,240
from the you know from the zero one to

318
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:54,779
Etc tier 364.

319
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,639
it's yellow the first thing okay so look

320
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,980
nice you know so I start with zero yeah

321
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,019
anyway you are here obviously the life

322
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,959
function is still needed right we need

323
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:07,139
to convert one state to a day since

324
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:10,260
January so if we're here look

325
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:13,500
if we arrive here right this is a run

326
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,260
with the numbers 365 number so if I'm

327
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,180
saying you are here you arrive here I'm

328
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,920
going to plus one here

329
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,320
and then you leave here

330
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,360
and then you leave here and I need to

331
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,440
minus one on the next day right so if

332
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,279
you leave

333
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,040
on the fifth of the if you departure and

334
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,019
the fifth of March then on the 6th of

335
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,459
March I minus one

336
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,459
okay only six months

337
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:46,860
yeah yeah I know I know just some

338
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:51,000
example here here okay right so now

339
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:52,680
Ryan Ryan arrive somehow here right so

340
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,339
you need some plus one here

341
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:59,160
and if if it departure uh this one and

342
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:03,540
then you do minus one on the next day

343
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:07,920
okay so he's covered this period I have

344
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:11,519
this 365 of uh 65 packets you can say

345
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,560
the counters by bucket integers so for

346
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,680
example you are here 90.

347
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:21,779
first one and you leave at 95 minus one

348
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:23,279
and then y incomes that 93 plus one 98

349
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,380
minus one

350
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,420
that's something like an example

351
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,339
once that that's very simple and then I

352
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,560
can just go through this

353
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,399
I have a content right at the beginning

354
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,259
it's all zero zero here so look

355
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,699
zero plus one is one

356
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,339
what

357
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:45,240
and then I can do this accumulate right

358
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:47,880
one one one one two two two two two two

359
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,240
two two one

360
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,480
one one one one one one zero

361
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,680
okay so what I'm doing here so how many

362
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,240
days

363
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,699
how many days

364
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,579
how can we know which days are two

365
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:04,079
people in the same place so what numbers

366
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:06,540
are we looking for

367
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,600
two exactly we are looking for two

368
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:12,480
accumulate so if you get it so it's a

369
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,819
ruler a ruler you know each number on

370
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,900
the ruler right the represent a counter

371
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,500
a number

372
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:24,059
and I just have to Market you increment

373
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,860
one on day 90 and equipment on 95

374
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:27,419
because they're living right

375
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:31,440
and Ryan

376
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:34,620
comes arrives at 93 leaves at 98 right

377
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,419
so I just have to do this uh plus one

378
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,340
plus one minus one minus one but this is

379
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:41,460
not enough I just have to go from the

380
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:46,039
beginning with the counter now it's zero

381
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,039
zero zero zero one okay

382
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,940
and then we are looking for two

383
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,380
how many days we just have to kind of

384
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,380
days blind sweep

385
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,000
from the left to the right

386
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,039
usually encounter oh we can do is

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,179
accumulate using accumulate right

388
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,820
remember not accumulate what's

389
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:14,700
accumulate one two three four accumulate

390
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,280
this we turn this into a cumulate let's

391
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,940
accumulate and then you become one

392
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,559
one plus two one plus two plus three one

393
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,480
plus two plus three plus four yeah

394
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,059
accumulate quick example yeah we talk

395
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,640
about that one three

396
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,780
six ten right

397
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,640
yeah

398
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,000
okay I'm gonna divide the term for this

399
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,980
one okay there are 365 days so let's do

400
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,660
these days

401
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,660
equals

402
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,900
at the beginning zero times I need to

403
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,059
put it as 3767 because I I need to

404
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,600
Market it next day

405
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:55,919
minus one right I'm leaving at

406
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:59,520
day 90. but I'm still in that place on

407
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,360
day 90. I'm away I'm not there on day 91

408
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,460
right

409
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,980
so we need to plus one okay let's say

410
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,980
you want E2 ah one uh

411
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:13,160
plus two

412
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:17,820
uh 300 that's a good question okay

413
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:21,660
365 days all right on on not until they

414
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:25,260
leave here and nearly here 366. how come

415
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,539
she plus two that's a good question or

416
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,100
LF function okay F function you know the

417
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:31,140
F function this is the number of things

418
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:35,700
generate and that's a very good question

419
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:39,120
yeah it is 366 but F function returns

420
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,980
one number one for first of January

421
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,500
all right so this function returns

422
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,020
number one on the first of January all

423
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,960
right the day

424
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,900
zero is actually not used so we start

425
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,400
from 1 to

426
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:59,299
365 right and then plus one that is 1 to

427
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:03,720
366 but in order to use the index

428
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:07,440
366 you have to add okay 367 because the

429
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,240
index style is zero right like this yeah

430
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,860
you're listening that's very good

431
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,900
question and

432
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,600
let's say you want YouTube it's already

433
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,220
converted as a date right it's a it's a

434
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,840
number integer right so we can just do

435
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,140
this base

436
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,419
E1 plus equal one

437
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,400
face

438
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:29,100
E2 plus one eh now tell me why do we

439
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,200
need to plus one here minus equal one

440
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,820
and days

441
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,940
R1

442
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:40,200
plus equal one phase

443
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:45,600
R2 plus 1 minus equal one okay look I

444
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:48,480
live on Friday so which day I'm away

445
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,600
so Friday I'm taking an airplane

446
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,299
so I'm still at a place right so I plus

447
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,580
one the next day the Saturday I'm not in

448
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:59,700
that place or I'm not in the Paris

449
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:02,460
yeah so I need to pass on here yeah I'm

450
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,000
leaving a Friday but I'm still in Paris

451
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,640
on Friday so I'm not in Paris the next

452
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,160
day plus day okay yeah

453
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,840
make sense

454
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,539
okay and now we just have to do this

455
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,860
like the answer equals zero and then for

456
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:22,799
I in range we start from the first day

457
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,419
to 360

458
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,580
six right

459
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:29,820
then

460
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:34,200
there's a counter C equals zero C

461
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:38,580
plus equals these days

462
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:41,400
I right if c equal equal to then answer

463
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,440
plus equals one right return

464
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,240
answer all right this is called the

465
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,919
that's what we're saying like zero zero

466
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,280
zero zero one one one one one one one

467
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:53,760
two two two two one one one two two yeah

468
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,360
that's why it's basically we install a a

469
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,860
prefix prefix sum

470
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,440
accumulate some in a c and we check if

471
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,179
it's a day to use layer 2 2 means the

472
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,039
two people on the day right and we

473
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,120
increment if it's a two then we

474
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,400
increment

475
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,620
obviously we can do this better so we

476
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,820
can accumulate 10 is into accumulate so

477
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,980
days equals this accumulate days right

478
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,140
then we do this accumulation and then we

479
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,340
just have to check in return

480
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,140
days

481
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,679
.com

482
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,960
two right look a little bit simple come

483
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,539
to next day

484
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,440
what's time complexity for this one uh

485
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:37,080
is it very tricky oh one yes why is that

486
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,480
one because it's the numbers yeah

487
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:44,039
because look constant right they're only

488
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:47,159
365 days they come be more the most you

489
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,900
can run is 365 days the iteration right

490
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,120
the previous one

491
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,220
is still one right we have two in this

492
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,320
conversion and then they're only 12

493
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,260
months we are only 12 months and the F

494
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,179
function also takes the o1 constant

495
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,820
because they're only 12 months the

496
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,280
maximum the maximum number of two ratio

497
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,340
you need to run to get a day since

498
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,320
January is 12.

499
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,419
comes space Bozo one okay so what have

500
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,980
you learned today and can you tell me

501
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:15,480
what have you learned there are two

502
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,860
solutions what have you learned which

503
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,320
one you think is better easy to

504
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,840
understand

505
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,880
okay what's the problem what Solutions

506
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,700
can we apply

507
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,500
which one you like and that's it

508
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,799
uh well

509
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,799
uh

510
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:38,640
uh two people yeah two people and they

511
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:41,340
guarantee this hotel yes and

512
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,500
so we

513
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:46,320
so we

514
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:50,400
say they have a arriving day and

515
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:56,940
believing day yes and so we want to work

516
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,659
out uh how many days Days uh there they

517
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,659
are

518
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:02,460
in the same place in the hotel yeah okay

519
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,980
so what solution what's the first

520
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:12,179
solution what's the second solution well

521
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:15,600
so we so we have e e one E1 and R1 uh of

522
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:19,740
arriving days and

523
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:25,440
ET and artistic of uh leaving there so e

524
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:27,840
e so so the maximum of

525
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,539
of arriving day

526
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,100
the difference

527
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:37,320
is the maximum of the difference of the

528
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:40,020
maximum arriving day at the minimum of

529
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,419
uh leaving the a well that's the first

530
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,460
solution during subtraction okay and the

531
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:49,679
second solution what's this

532
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:51,539
so we say for sorry

533
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,500
we have this

534
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:59,700
kind of number line or something of some

535
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,700
sort uh 366

536
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,919
um Dave and

537
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:08,100
and

538
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:11,820
so three plus one for the arriving there

539
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:14,400
and minus one for the living day the

540
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,320
next of the living day right yeah and

541
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,200
then we do this scan from the beginning

542
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,400
to this accumulation anyway what are we

543
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,320
looking for which number we are looking

544
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:27,080
for

545
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:27,080
uh two and what's two mean there's two

546
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,100
that's right yeah and that's how we

547
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,720
count it and we can do this accumulate

548
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,940
some right using a community over to

549
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,279
this simple I post common spaces over

550
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,580
okay let's see for today bye bye

551
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:45,480
bye bye bye

552
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:48,539
nice hello hello Mr Ryan all right

553
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:51,240
right yeah so let's look at this uh

554
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:55,260
interesting problem Eric and Ryan right

555
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:58,380
Eric and Ryan you're going to Paris okay

556
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:02,480
you're going to Paris Eric arrives in

557
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,480
Paris at the 1st of March

558
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:11,880
and he left Paris at the 6th of March

559
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:15,840
okay and now Ryan okay he arrives at

560
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:19,799
Paris at I don't know second of March I

561
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,960
leave at 10 no match geez

562
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:26,039
at least there's no luck before you like

563
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,320
Eric guys one to ten and we go seven to

564
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:31,020
twenty that's fine okay so the question

565
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,700
comes that how many days you post in

566
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,700
Paris

567
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
um

568
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:43,020
this departure you still counted in

569
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:45,779
Paris okay five how what are those

570
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:49,080
well the second third fourth day fancy

571
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:52,260
okay so it's this video two three four

572
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,020
five six okay so five okay for

573
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,900
Simplicity let's just only assumed you

574
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:00,960
both arrived in the same calendar year

575
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:03,840
okay so you first arrive and departure

576
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,659
in the same calendar year and also for

577
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,700
Simplicity we assume it's uh not a leap

578
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,419
year do you still remember what's leap

579
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,740
year

580
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:15,720
yes it's been February has 29 days okay

581
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,380
when it's the leap year the February has

582
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,539
29 but when it's not leap year 28 days

583
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,000
okay that's good so we assume it's not

584
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:26,159
Olympia so February has 28 days

585
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,400
I give you like the day for example Eric

586
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:33,500
arrives at uh

587
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,500
when I arrive and Eric leaves

588
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:41,460
so can we visualize it look Eric here

589
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:44,340
right if you have arrive departure and

590
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,919
then you arrives departure

591
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:50,940
so how many possibility look

592
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:54,559
Eric Ryan okay I give a few Solutions

593
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,559
right the possibilities Eric

594
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:01,320
Ryan

595
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,320
right I arrived early Eric

596
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:09,559
come back again no no no one finger Go

597
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,559
Eric

598
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:12,320
Ryan

599
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,500
Eric

600
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,260
Ryan

601
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,700
Eric

602
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,700
anymore

603
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,700
um

604
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:34,860
all right and when I go I arrive before

605
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:38,400
him and leave before him

606
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:41,940
we're done okay so basically this in

607
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:45,480
what cases there are no days you both

608
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,820
spend together so there's zero days you

609
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,419
spend together which is two cases there

610
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:56,340
are no intercession so basically looks

611
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:58,500
the the one at the right top right yeah

612
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,740
these two okay so you see so we're

613
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,480
visualizing the program in intervals so

614
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,120
basically we want to find out the number

615
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,340
of days the intersection between two

616
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,919
intervals right so here in this case

617
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,980
look this one this one there's no

618
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,900
intercession all the rest look all the

619
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:19,080
rest

620
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,820
the they are intercession right so how

621
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,919
do we find all the intercession look at

622
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,080
this okay let me let me put this a

623
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,299
little bit longer okay so look the

624
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,500
intersection is this speed right

625
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,840
all right

626
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:35,460
this intercession

627
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:38,760
right this intercession this bit this

628
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,080
insertation a little bit okay all these

629
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,260
four scenarios

630
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,539
we can visualize it as this one

631
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:48,659
all these scenario four scenarios we can

632
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:51,960
get an intercession bye all right look

633
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:55,980
at this ends this is E1 E2 and this is

634
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,200
R1 R2 okay okay so we want to find out

635
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:01,200
the integration so this intersection is

636
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:05,580
the minimum of E2 R2

637
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,380
okay minimum of E2 R2

638
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,080
and the left bit

639
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,460
is maximum of E1 R1

640
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,340
okay

641
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:19,140
look at this and hold on is that look E1

642
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:23,340
E2 R1 R2 the minimum of E2 R2

643
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:26,880
a maximum of E1 R1 okay the minimum of

644
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,980
E2 R2 is this one the maximum of E1 R1

645
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,120
is this one so the intersection is this

646
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:36,899
speed yes it's right look E1 E2 R1 R2

647
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:40,980
the minimum of E2 R2 is this bit right

648
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:42,960
the maximum of R1 UI is here right so

649
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:47,159
intersection is fifth

650
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:50,700
and and again here E1 E2 R1 R2 the

651
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:54,960
minimum of E2 R2 is here the maximum of

652
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:57,120
E1 R1 is here right you see okay

653
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,539
so we can take the intercession by this

654
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,760
it's from the maximum this one to

655
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:04,860
minimum so we go to the subtraction and

656
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,380
do this abs

657
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,059
at the low Value Plus one we need to

658
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,100
plus one for the end days right because

659
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:13,679
you arrive on the first leave a second

660
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,279
how many days you spend together in

661
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,860
Paris two minus one plus one is two days

662
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:23,520
you call it a day on your departure as

663
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,500
being in Paris I mean we are given the

664
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,419
Theta will be something like this first

665
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,279
of all we need to convert a date into a

666
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:31,320
number so what number how can we convert

667
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,260
this into a number

668
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,360
all the data in the one calendar year so

669
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,320
we can count how many days since were

670
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,840
they

671
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,539
so I give you two days like

672
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,340
can you tell me the number of days

673
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:47,279
between

674
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:49,260
fifth of March to

675
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,799
1st of May

676
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:55,380
how many days in between

677
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:59,240
how many days between 5th of March to

678
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,240
1st of May how many days in between

679
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,700
how do you come I mean let me answer

680
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:08,820
this question how many days between

681
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,940
fifth or March to 1st of May

682
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,940
um

683
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,500
what's 31 days

684
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,240
[Music]

685
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:25,460
but how do you come use your finger like

686
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:30,480
start from Counting from fifth

687
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:34,260
31 minus five thirty one twenty six okay

688
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,539
yeah okay so you kind of remain again

689
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,340
yeah but you have to find out that the

690
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:41,460
remaining days in the next government

691
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,740
right and plus the next home month plus

692
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:46,380
next whole month all right so basically

693
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:51,260
you don't reach this way right look

694
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:53,760
uh this is each month yeah so 30 plus

695
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:57,659
2016. okay so you are counting here all

696
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,600
right so basically 56. okay look your

697
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:03,299
approach is counting look this is fifth

698
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,640
um uh match you count the remaining days

699
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:10,020
in that match you plus the whole month

700
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,279
April you plus the date for the May

701
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,559
right

702
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,760
yeah you do it counting you added this

703
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,100
yeah

704
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:21,960
is there other ways to do it I mean look

705
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:24,000
how to do it what's here generally fast

706
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,960
so how do we use this how do we count

707
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,840
the days

708
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,779
how do we know this piece what's this

709
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:34,039
bit you want to know this thing right

710
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:37,559
your approach is added up these three

711
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:39,720
segments right but let's say if I tell

712
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:42,059
you okay I know that how many days since

713
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,919
January 1st to May

714
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:47,460
is this bit

715
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:50,760
yeah and how many days from January to

716
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,919
here is this week so what's this bit

717
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,159
so I know this bit I know the speed so

718
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:59,760
what's this bit if this is a and this is

719
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,860
B so what's this see what's this C

720
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,279
equals what a minus

721
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:08,339
a minus B okay how do we calculate two

722
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:14,280
days in one calendar year you get the

723
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:18,720
number that you know that it ends

724
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:22,080
a little bit and they made the first

725
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:27,780
and you came from January the first

726
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,780
yeah let's give that an A and what

727
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:38,700
um and then you count January to the

728
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:41,099
5th of March the first number yeah and

729
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,320
then you get B

730
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:45,599
the same thing for people and I used to

731
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,639
the subject that's normal taste the key

732
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,200
thing here is that we can count how many

733
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,440
days between two days in one calendar

734
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,780
year using the subtraction we need to

735
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,820
count how many days since the first of

736
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,760
January and then if we do that we can do

737
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:03,720
this subtraction okay so suppose we have

738
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,119
this function f f day let's test the

739
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,280
number of the things the first of

740
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,280
January in that calendar year okay

741
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,040
yeah I function and now we can do this

742
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,240
if I want to get the number of days D1

743
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:20,579
to D2 then we can do this fd1 minus fd2

744
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,400
abs

745
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:26,160
plus one okay then we can map the date

746
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,859
to the number of days to the integer now

747
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,900
we can do this simple math here all

748
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:32,040
right of course we have to check these

749
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,780
two conditions when there are no

750
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:41,339
intersections if E2 okay so the E1 E2 R1

751
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:42,900
R2 okay so if R2 is more than E1 or R1

752
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:45,300
is bigger than E2 there is no

753
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,839
interception now with the 10 0 otherwise

754
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:54,079
we return this ABS mean E2 R2 minus

755
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:58,500
maximum E1 R1 plus one so E2 R2

756
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:00,720
E1 R1 E2 R2 are the integer on the

757
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,119
number of days since

758
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,400
1st of January and that can be obtained

759
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,440
by this F function f function I'm going

760
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,260
to Simply write the one okay now all

761
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,300
three hyphen 05

762
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,260
a string then first of all we need to

763
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:19,940
split this right Define f day

764
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:24,060
a a equals Mac

765
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:27,020
integer D dot split

766
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,020
hyphen

767
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,060
Theta spray hyphen and we got a way with

768
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,040
two string o305 and now we need to map

769
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:38,400
to integer convert it to three and five

770
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,680
once we have three and five so I'm going

771
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,079
to place M months

772
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,480
and Day date

773
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,339
okay months and day these are two

774
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,560
integer and now we need to count how

775
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:52,800
many days since the first of January

776
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:56,820
right look how many days in January

777
00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:00,680
31 right 28 February it's not a leap

778
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:03,359
year 30 31 Etc right second of February

779
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,099
March doesn't have 30 days

780
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:10,440
April has five days of March of 31.

781
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:13,920
thank you see so much how many days

782
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,000
between January 1st to 50 March how do

783
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,960
we count it

784
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,119
how would you do it at 3128 together and

785
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,700
then plus five right

786
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,000
so okay so you sum up the months before

787
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:29,480
that right all right so we'll return

788
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,480
some

789
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:45,540
elements then we can say days up to

790
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,180
up two months right but up to months

791
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:50,220
after a month we put the extra Jailer at

792
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:53,460
the beginning right so but because we

793
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,859
are not getting that the month is one

794
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,619
one is January and the index style is

795
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:00,839
the zero so we put that extra zero at

796
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:03,900
the beginning so we sum up that and plus

797
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:06,599
stay right that's the day that's the

798
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,900
first approach basically a function we

799
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:12,060
we take in the string of date we split

800
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,560
it we convert it to integer and then we

801
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,180
count how many days

802
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,400
the whole month

803
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,680
right up to the previous months and plus

804
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,020
the extra day right extra day of the

805
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,480
government and that F function retains

806
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:26,760
the number of days in January we using

807
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,000
this estate F function will be able to

808
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,040
map the string date in an arrival they

809
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,740
departure day into

810
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,079
integer and then we compare we just

811
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,119
basically transform this problem into

812
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:42,240
checking if their intercession between

813
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,380
two intervals yeah and they are quite a

814
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,660
few possibilities am I right yeah

815
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,880
okay the time complexity and space

816
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:55,920
versus oh one constant here because they

817
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:58,140
are at most 12 months 365 days am I yes

818
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,740
another way it will be quite interesting

819
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:04,320
it's called and we will be able to uh

820
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,839
use this prefix sum accumulate remember

821
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,579
accumulate so look how many days in a

822
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:10,820
year

823
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:10,820
365 right

824
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:19,260
not a ruler

825
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:23,400
it moves okay the first day

826
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:25,740
second day Third Day Etc okay to 265

827
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,260
okay

828
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:31,020
that was not equal I know I know the

829
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:33,119
example so the days are too big okay so

830
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,980
look first of all you know there's an

831
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,619
Arrival Day right something that I like

832
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:42,359
right I need to convert it to a lumber a

833
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:44,940
number right so I have uh E1 E2 E1 for

834
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:49,140
the Arrival Day of Eric E2 for departure

835
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:51,960
day of Eric R1 R2 Arrival Day for Orion

836
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:54,420
departure day for Ryan and these are

837
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,440
four numbers map to this right map to

838
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:01,760
this ruler E1 this here is E1 right

839
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,760
and here is into

840
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:06,359
and for example here

841
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:09,359
is R1

842
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:12,560
here is R2 okay

843
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:16,260
at the beginning all these 356

844
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,940
365 63 packets right you can send it in

845
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,500
the packet each packet contains a

846
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,320
counter number

847
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,820
so E1 I need to plus one here

848
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,359
and E2

849
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:30,780
e to the next of E2 I need to minus one

850
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:33,540
right because Eric is still in Paris at

851
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,220
E2 but not in Paris when E2 plus one

852
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,700
right here

853
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:40,560
and right and again here plus one and

854
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,020
minus one the next day after the

855
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,920
departure I have a counter okay counter

856
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,940
zero zero zero one

857
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,300
okay

858
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,300
two

859
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:56,339
two two two one

860
00:40:53,820 --> 00:41:00,359
one one one it's yellow

861
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:04,940
yeah okay let me do it again look it's

862
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,940
yellow zero zero zero zero plus one one

863
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,960
one one two

864
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,960
one

865
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
one

866
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:19,200
okay so let me know this so you could be

867
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,060
like that zero zero zero one plus one

868
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,480
here

869
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:27,660
plus one two two two two two two two

870
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:31,320
minus one one one minus one zero two

871
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,700
zero so how many days the your post in

872
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,160
Paris

873
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,200
how many days you posted what are we

874
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,940
looking for is what are we looking for

875
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,099
here

876
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,339
um what are we looking for here in this

877
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:46,800
land look at what I did yeah I came in

878
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:49,619
the air counter zero zero zero zero plus

879
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,619
one one one one one plus one two two two

880
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:55,440
two minus one one one one one minus one

881
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:57,839
zero zero zero zero I have a counter so

882
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,020
what number

883
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,380
are we looking for at least here we need

884
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:07,460
to count which number as uh two what

885
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,460
does it mean two by two

886
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,859
bang sweet from the left to the right

887
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:24,900
right I have a line sweeping yeah okay

888
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:27,680
yeah so first of all we have released

889
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:31,859
the counter day days at the beginning

890
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:34,920
equals zero times 367. okay why is this

891
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:37,920
367 because the day start from the first

892
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:41,220
one so it's we need to use the index 1

893
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,400
to 365 right but we need to plus one

894
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:47,400
thing why as I said the minus one

895
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,760
what happened when should we minus one

896
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,980
the next day of departure am I you're

897
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,420
leaving at least Saturday you're still

898
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,780
in

899
00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:01,020
Paris on Saturday right you are not here

900
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,940
on Sunday so we need minus one the next

901
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,619
day of departure so that's why we need

902
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:08,640
to pass one is so the index we are

903
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:12,180
looking for is 1 to 366. so we need to

904
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,040
do this times uh allocate and array with

905
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,380
367.

906
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,300
right we are not using the first index

907
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:22,880
anyway

908
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:22,880
okay and then now it's easier base

909
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,280
f

910
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:29,579
E1

911
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,800
plus equal one base

912
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:34,380
f e 2

913
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,960
plus 1 okay departure then the next day

914
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,880
depart today minus equal one

915
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,260
days

916
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,980
f

917
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:45,540
1 plus one uh R1

918
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,579
plus equal one

919
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:52,020
that is

920
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:54,300
f r 2 plus 1 minus equal one okay the

921
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:58,319
next state of the departure then we just

922
00:43:54,300 --> 00:44:03,060
do this here answer equals zero C equals

923
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:05,220
zero for I in red we start from what

924
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,579
first day two

925
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:12,060
360

926
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:16,020
right 367 okay

927
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:20,880
C plus equal base

928
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:24,180
I if c equal equal to answer plus equal

929
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,460
one right and return answer look see the

930
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:30,119
counter and I need to check each day

931
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:32,579
from 1 to 366. C plus this one that he

932
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,859
was doing counting zero zero zero if

933
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:36,300
it's two if it's two then I increase

934
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:39,300
right

935
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,619
base we can do this we can use the

936
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,500
accumulation so first of all we

937
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:44,900
converted the accumulate right a equals

938
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,640
this

939
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,440
accumulate accumulate

940
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,920
base

941
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:56,339
and then we just need to return a DOT

942
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,440
count two one what's accumulate one two

943
00:44:56,339 --> 00:45:00,540
three four an array with one two three

944
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,280
four what's accumulative when you do the

945
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,500
accumulate you accumulate returns an

946
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:08,280
iterator you'll be convert it to a list

947
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:10,980
it will become one one plus two one plus

948
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,319
two plus three one plus two plus three

949
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,520
plus four right this is accumulate so

950
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:18,060
each one

951
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:20,280
become the sum

952
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:23,040
from first element to the current

953
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:27,180
element right one one plus two one three

954
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:31,079
six ten right so exactly here

955
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:33,720
plus 0 plus 0 plus 0 plus 1 plus 1 plus

956
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:35,880
1 minus one minus one minus one yeah

957
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,740
okay

958
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,740
next this complexity is one constant

959
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:44,220
because this problem we are given two

960
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:47,220
days and then they are maximum 365 days

961
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:49,260
and a maximum 12 months it's about the

962
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,940
problem so the time and space complexity

963
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,099
is a one

964
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,960
okay okay so what have you learned today

965
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:56,579
what have you learned today what's the

966
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,520
problem and how many ways were you

967
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:01,800
solving this which way you like online

968
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,900
okay can you can you try to say a few

969
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,480
more sentences okay not just say a few

970
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,460
words come on try to for example I'm I'm

971
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,630
just to explain to me what have you

972
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,119
learned today

973
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,619
[Music]

974
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,720
calendar

975
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:17,700
what's the problem come on try to

976
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,579
explain them all we want to find how

977
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:26,060
much how many days are we together okay

978
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:26,060
and how do we do it we used

979
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:31,700
um we

980
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:34,500
line thing line method

981
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:37,140
what's the alarm method

982
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,720
is when you zero zeros and you're

983
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,859
looking for two

984
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,560
how many days

985
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:46,140
yeah accumulate somewhere so the problem

986
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:49,700
is that we are given two pairs of

987
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:52,740
arrival and departure days right E1 E2

988
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:55,280
represent the Arrival Day and departure

989
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,280
day for Eric

990
00:46:58,099 --> 00:47:05,220
and then these four dates uh in one

991
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:08,460
calendar and we are assuming it's a not

992
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:11,040
a leap year there are 365 days and 28

993
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:14,099
days in February the question is that we

994
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:17,400
want to find out how many days that you

995
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:19,500
both African lion stay in the same place

996
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,859
right we need to convert the date

997
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:25,260
actually date a stream into a number and

998
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:27,780
we can do that by counting the number of

999
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:30,180
days since January when we're converting

1000
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:32,339
to the dates to a number it's easy to do

1001
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,980
the math to calculate how many days

1002
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:38,640
between two days right all right for

1003
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:41,760
example Eric arrive at the 1st of March

1004
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,800
and departure at 5th on March you cannot

1005
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,319
subtract two days easily but you can

1006
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:49,380
subtract two numbers easily okay so the

1007
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:51,060
first way is that when we do that we are

1008
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,040
actually mapping the problem into

1009
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:56,339
finding the intercession of two

1010
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,619
intervals on the line right and then

1011
00:47:56,339 --> 00:48:01,440
there are two possibilities that there

1012
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,700
is no intersection when the departure

1013
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,900
day

1014
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:10,319
of the Ryan is before the arrival date

1015
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:12,900
of area or when they Arrival Day of Ryan

1016
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:15,240
is after the departure day of Eric

1017
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,420
there's no intercession otherwise we can

1018
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:21,480
get the infrastructure by the mean

1019
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,040
E2 R2

1020
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,599
minus

1021
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,359
Max

1022
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:29,760
E1 r1s we just showed it before okay

1023
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:32,240
that's one way the second method is that

1024
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,180
we have a 360

1025
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:39,660
566 bucket with the numbers a counter

1026
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:42,359
right and then we can plus one on a

1027
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:44,940
departure day and -1

1028
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:47,099
on the next day of departure day and

1029
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:49,200
then we do this accumulate some

1030
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:51,240
a prefix sum from left to the right

1031
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,760
let's call line sweet

1032
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,119
and then we are looking for the value

1033
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:00,180
when it's become two that means that

1034
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:03,660
uh two people are on the same place okay

1035
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:06,060
that was Agron takes one time in one

1036
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:10,560
space because this is the bounding

1037
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:13,380
problem okay that only uh 12 months 365

1038
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:17,359
days okay that's it for today

1039
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,359
bye-bye bye bye
