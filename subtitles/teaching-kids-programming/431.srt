1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,360
hello

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,040
uh iphones yeah we have talked about ip

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,279
address when your internet when your

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,880
computer is connected to internet yeah

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,320
you're being given this

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,360
ib address yeah most of cases okay the

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,320
iphone is four numbers phone number like

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,320
a dot b dot c dot d we talked about this

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,080
before yeah eight of these therefore not

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,840
four integer each one

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,320
yeah each one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,279
is between

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,800
255 and integer between 25 55 and 0 okay

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,880
c

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,079
so i'm writing that b c c okay

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:44,520
yeah okay so let me write a number here

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,520
265 8.32.5

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,160
is this our ip address which these are

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
beautiful now why is that because it has

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,960
over you know

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,790
this one yes and half at least 1.2.3 is

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,850
this iphone

23
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,850
[Music]

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,080
no no yeah why because it has

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,640
yes yes okay exactly okay so

26
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,680
welcome at least

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,200
okay so we we have removed the dots so

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,200
can you restore ip address here

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,560
255 255 1133 so what's the valid idea it

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
could be money

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,200
yeah it could be money ryan

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
you want to get this one i have removed

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,040
a dot from the original ip address so

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,040
what could the original ipos be

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,040
255.255.111.33

36
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,159
okay and this is one i know is there any

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,280
others

38
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,840
and what could that be two five dot five

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,719
two dots five five

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,320
one

41
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,240
huh

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,190
um

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,039
dot two five five

44
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,080
[Music]

45
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,000
exactly

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,680
so there too okay very well done so

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
what's your thoughts about doing this

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,440
how how do you find out there too

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,680
how do you do it i mean what's your

50
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,920
original approach

51
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,720
oh you're trying to do that here

52
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,879
so

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,440
what i was doing is

54
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,120
so i just count how many numbers are

55
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,599
they yeah and

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,599
they are

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,640
um

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,640
11

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,920
11 yeah

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,480
so

61
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,599
yeah exactly yeah yeah

62
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,680
okay so you count 11. now okay

63
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,040
i know what why why why you said two

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,720
five five and then two five right and

65
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,920
then it could be how how did you find

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,760
these actually i just wanted to know how

67
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,519
because i don't actually wanna wait for

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,560
two five five

69
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,120
because

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,000
because i mean two five five is

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,319
less

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,920
than two by six so it it could be you

73
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,840
know yeah it could be the umbrella

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,800
answer and then you jump you jump yeah

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,280
you can jump yeah until you find it yeah

76
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,239
all right okay so let's

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
i mean

78
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,080
i obviously need the two five five two

79
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,360
five five even though i could do like

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,239
two

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,680
two

82
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,480
i can do

83
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,519
two

84
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,040
five yeah i can't do five to five but

85
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,040
you can do five two yeah but

86
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,280
yeah and then you do five five but look

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,040
it's more than three then that's

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,920
definitely not possible okay so you

89
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,920
doing now a very important point is that

90
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,080
we have to use all the digit

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,319
but we can't use too many digits right

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,120
so we have to use all the digits right

93
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,439
you can say two five five two five fifty

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,840
five one hand one 111 but we have uh

95
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,840
you know this 33 we can't it can't fit

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,799
into the last digit because it's too big

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,239
right so each one has only three at most

98
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
three digits right you can't have more

99
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,920
than three digits because this two five

100
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,519
five is the three db you can't have four

101
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,280
digits etc okay and then obviously in

102
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
the meter in the middle we have to check

103
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
if it has leading zero right if it's

104
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,160
leaving zero zero one this is not a

105
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,240
valid digit right zero

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,840
you can only have a one

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,160
it can only have one

108
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,240
uh leading zero and unless it's a zero

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,720
if it's zero that's fine otherwise you

110
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,800
can't have a living hero

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,440
okay so our approach yeah so we can do

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,280
this look at we can track uh we can do

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,080
this type of search backtracking yeah so

114
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,479
we we can try the first stitch current

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,680
the next digit right we can try next

116
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,720
digit

117
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,280
and then

118
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,000
jump next digit next digit and here we

119
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,280
use all the digits right yeah we can use

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
we can go for this approach

121
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,320
there's only one one thing we need to

122
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,479
remember is that when checking that when

123
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,919
jumping over the digit we have to check

124
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,680
uh

125
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,680
check if it's a value

126
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
if it's valid uh

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,160
if the

128
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,639
is between 0 to

129
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,960
255 and if it's zero it can only be

130
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,080
represented as finger zero okay it can't

131
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,240
have this

132
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,919
zero zero thing okay for example i can

133
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,360
give you an example

134
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,039
zero

135
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,320
uh

136
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,919
okay so 2 200

137
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,840
to

138
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,520
20255

139
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,680
1

140
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,680
to 23. okay so can you restore this

141
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,199
yeah it could be many yes but yeah it

142
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,199
could be many so for example if you want

143
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
to have a zero you can only have two

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,560
twenty

145
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,199
zero twenty zero

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,919
two five five one two three that could

147
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,120
be one example yes but you can't have uh

148
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,280
twenty

149
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,000
zero two

150
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,960
five five and one two three yeah

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,960
this is not right right yeah this is not

152
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,319
right because this two has the leading

153
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,639
zero which is not valid okay

154
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,840
that's very good so we yeah so basically

155
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,600
we are asking computer to do this uh

156
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,759
uh

157
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,280
do research for us so let's say bye

158
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,160
that's what search

159
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,120
so

160
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,080
by this default search so we can pass a

161
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,840
parameter current which is a a list and

162
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,479
which is the list

163
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,080
so so which is which is the list yeah

164
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,960
it's this so this this contains the the

165
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,280
number of these the digit the most it

166
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,160
could be four right there before so we

167
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,400
can just

168
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,080
first of all we need to check check the

169
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,680
length with the lengths of all the

170
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,880
features together so n equals the sum

171
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,639
length

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,160
x for

173
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
x in

174
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,120
current okay so this is a very useful

175
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,520
thing to do so what does it mean so for

176
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,199
example if this

177
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,000
current is

178
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,240
one two three

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,840
three four

180
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,400
five okay for example like there are

181
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,280
only three numbers here so the length is

182
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,199
three digits plus two digits plus one

183
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,240
digit that would be six statistics so n

184
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,400
equal equals to b equals to six okay and

185
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,440
then now now after this we need to check

186
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,199
look if the length of the current yeah

187
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,879
if then the current equals four what

188
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,360
does it mean so we have already four

189
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,080
digits and then we have to check if n

190
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,440
if n equals okay so

191
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,440
here the original one will be a

192
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,919
restore

193
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,720
restore ip address which we have we have

194
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,479
a string f string so if n equals the

195
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,800
length of s

196
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,120
then we put it in the answer so let's

197
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,720
put it the answer here answer

198
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
equals the list

199
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,440
because there's a list of ideas then we

200
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,800
have to append

201
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,800
answer append

202
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,599
now we want to convert okay we want to

203
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,360
convert these one

204
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,400
to

205
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,400
we want to convert at least to to string

206
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,039
how do you still remember array of this

207
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,080
we want to make this one two three four

208
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,399
two one top two dot three dot four

209
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,080
do you know how how can we convert it

210
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,279
from this is the list to here

211
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,399
what

212
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,040
was that okay so we can depend

213
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,360
dot dot join

214
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,720
carbon

215
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,000
yeah right

216
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,040
yeah

217
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,120
okay so now uh if if not if not then we

218
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,120
just return here because it's not

219
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,160
satisfying the requirement that we just

220
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,839
can we can just uh skip okay and then

221
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,440
now we just have to

222
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,920
for

223
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,920
go uh look for the next digit so the

224
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,040
next 60 will be for i

225
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,560
in

226
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,519
range

227
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,240
yeah

228
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,399
now we are at we have n stitches

229
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,440
so we have n stitch from the string so

230
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,160
the string could be one two three four

231
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,120
five six yeah so for example if we have

232
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,200
one one top two top three

233
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,680
uh one two three so there are only three

234
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,720
digits so we can try on the fourth digit

235
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,959
here

236
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,000
yeah we'll try on the fourth digit right

237
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,240
so n is b3 we can try on the first piece

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,560
so that would be n from n

239
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,080
up to what to the end right so we can do

240
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
this to the end

241
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,120
but the thing is that

242
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,959
how many digits we can only we can try a

243
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,040
mouth do we have to try to the end

244
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,440
why is that how many digits so now i'm

245
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,800
at index i so which how many digits i

246
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,880
can try for the next next number

247
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,279
what's the maximum number of lengths

248
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,079
what was the maximum

249
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,560
what's the maximum of the digit

250
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,320
so what i mean is that look i i am look

251
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,200
i'm here right i'm here

252
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,399
i want to try the next digit so i try 3

253
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,640
4

254
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,600
or 3 4 five or three four five six do i

255
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,040
have to try three four five six

256
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,959
um

257
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,360
no right no why is that because it's

258
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,720
more than three digits we can only try

259
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
three teachers

260
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,079
yes three four five three digits because

261
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,720
if it's four digits it's definitely more

262
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,959
than 255 that's what i mean okay so we

263
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,440
can do this mean

264
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,640
we have this n plus three and all the

265
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,440
lengths as

266
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,240
if if it only has two digits left now we

267
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,320
we just have to try up to the end okay

268
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,560
try to after the end and then

269
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,480
the next stage will be what next digit

270
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,440
um

271
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,399
so x equals s

272
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,680
we start from the index n up to i plus

273
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,880
one

274
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,920
i plus 1 up to i right okay then we have

275
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,760
to check x if x is the requirement so

276
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,680
if

277
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,120
this is a string and we convert it to

278
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,480
integer x if in x is bigger than 0 and

279
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,079
smaller than 255

280
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,600
n okay

281
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,839
so

282
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,079
if it is zero okay if it's yellow then

283
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,480
we have to exclude the cases which is as

284
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,640
the you know this

285
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,320
multiple zeros okay so

286
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,160
if this is between this range also if if

287
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,720
what

288
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,399
if if length uh if n length

289
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,440
x

290
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,760
if it's uh bigger than 1

291
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,079
if it's bigger than 1

292
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,079
or

293
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,639
x

294
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,519
x equal equal 0 okay

295
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,279
so we have to check if it's zero okay if

296
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,240
it's zero

297
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,880
uh okay so i have to write this one here

298
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,560
and if this is zero

299
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,959
or

300
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:14,480
if it's bigger than one digit

301
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,480
and the first digit is not zero okay

302
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,959
then okay so okay so look at this

303
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,959
if we if we convert this x string this

304
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,399
is a pidgey

305
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,800
substring

306
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,959
to integer if it's between the

307
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,040
yellow and 250 times that's great but we

308
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,560
have to check one more thing if it's

309
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,480
zero if it's a single digit yellow or if

310
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,920
it's more than one digit but

311
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,519
if it's more than one digit then the

312
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,959
first stage can't be zero right all

313
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,920
right

314
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,000
yeah

315
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,560
so this this means that if it's a single

316
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,320
digit if it's a single zero that's fine

317
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,160
otherwise if it's more than it has more

318
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,399
than one digit then the first digit

319
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,480
can't be zero right make sense yeah and

320
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,959
then in this case then we can

321
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,440
we have this is a valid point so we can

322
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,800
current append

323
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,519
a plan x

324
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,000
and then we can do this different search

325
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,000
current

326
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,680
and then at the end we need to restore

327
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,839
the state which is pop

328
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,399
right so look

329
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,160
we we want to do the travel search right

330
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,240
we want to do the definition to pass

331
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,600
this current this isn't

332
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,440
remember

333
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,120
yesterday or the day before yesterday we

334
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,519
talked about uh

335
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,560
path by reference object reference if if

336
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,959
the array is mutable then then what does

337
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,200
it mean it means that anything change in

338
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,760
the function will be

339
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,079
impacting the value right yeah it will

340
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,240
change the whole value that's right so

341
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,839
look we're changing this the append

342
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,680
we're changing this uh

343
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,800
list yeah we're changing the list we

344
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,120
pass to the recursion we pass it

345
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,279
pass it to search

346
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,199
and before after that we need to restore

347
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,360
the state right so this is very

348
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,920
important current the prop state

349
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
okay calendar append and calendar apart

350
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,000
and then

351
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,480
in between

352
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,440
we pass the new

353
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,040
new state into the function okay

354
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,000
and then now we just return uh deficit

355
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,519
we give it a empty list and then return

356
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,399
answer yeah

357
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,639
okay

358
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,880
we can answer

359
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,880
yeah

360
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,040
everyone uh any questions i mean what

361
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,680
are you what have you learned so far

362
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,680
today what happened

363
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,920
so

364
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,279
so what what are we doing here what are

365
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,920
we doing here

366
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,279
we're doing stuff you're doing that way

367
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,120
great yeah okay so do do get it okay

368
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,199
let me

369
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,600
let me write the

370
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,440
okay so the original original one yeah

371
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,399
two five five

372
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,600
okay whereas two noise two five five two

373
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,480
five five

374
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,240
one one one three five okay this is the

375
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,079
original one

376
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,959
this is the original string okay so how

377
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,160
can we do this definitely empty this

378
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,399
underneath

379
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,600
let's empty this n equal that would be

380
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,079
zero right

381
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,240
then if not if not equal to four because

382
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,040
the current equals one zero element okay

383
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,880
now for i it was from zero to length as

384
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,160
a mean three so the first stitch would

385
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,120
go from two

386
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,920
to

387
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,120
255 right yeah

388
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,880
okay so let's say if we go to row two

389
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,440
and the next digit will be

390
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,959
from five it can go to the five okay so

391
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,399
it needs to take the one and the third

392
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,079
there will be

393
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,040
five

394
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,800
and then four stitches will be two right

395
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,560
and let's see because by this length the

396
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,560
length is only fourteen it's not equal

397
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,959
but how many digits one two three four

398
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,279
five eleven digits right

399
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,320
eleven digits so it's not adding it

400
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,720
right so the only two possibilities two

401
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,800
five two five one one one thirty five oh

402
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,279
two five five two four five eleven one

403
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,480
thirty five yeah as we talk about okay

404
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,399
so look if if we may we may uh

405
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,240
here we may check the length if the

406
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,480
length

407
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,120
if the length of s is bigger than 12

408
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,600
so what does it mean if it if the given

409
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,600
string is more than 12 digit do we need

410
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,759
to do this backtracking

411
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,079
yes or no

412
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,720
if this string is given like it's more

413
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,880
than 12 digit no right because it's not

414
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,000
possible if you divide it into four

415
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,120
parts then at least one of them

416
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,320
is more than three digits and that means

417
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,160
that

418
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,399
that means that it's not possible so we

419
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,320
can just directly return to this why is

420
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,560
that this is called pitching hole you're

421
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,920
not pitching for principal

422
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,440
yeah

423
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:51,120
okay i have a 10 box

424
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,120
i have a uh maybe okay five bucks

425
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,320
five uh

426
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,079
what what's the thing what's the

427
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,079
container that you put the pigeon in

428
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,040
what's the cage yeah what does it count

429
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,199
i think

430
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,959
okay okay we have five pages okay right

431
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,000
so we have uh

432
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:11,600
six pigeons

433
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,839
six pigeons five pages

434
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,880
so can i say that

435
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:20,160
at least can i say at least one

436
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,880
page will contain more than two

437
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,439
more than one kitchen all right

438
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,559
what does it mean do you get it

439
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,799
right

440
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,240
right

441
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,679
five page

442
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,280
if we want to put six pigeons in

443
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,880
there must be

444
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,000
at least

445
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
one

446
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,280
cage

447
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,240
has more than one pigeon all right

448
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,240
how can you prove it

449
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,559
that's the perfect explanation you can

450
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,840
sit you can teach mommy yeah this is

451
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,440
pitching the same thing here if we have

452
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,240
13 digit

453
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,240
yeah

454
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,080
certain digit we want to divide it into

455
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,520
four four parts

456
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,039
okay yeah

457
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,240
a b c d yeah so what does it mean

458
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,919
okay look for 13 digit

459
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,919
four parts what does it tell us

460
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,160
one of them

461
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,840
at least wonderland contains more than

462
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,160
three digits right

463
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,000
yeah 13 digits

464
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,200
yeah

465
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,520
makes sense

466
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,480
so if if one of them contains more than

467
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,720
three digits it's not a very iphone

468
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,280
right because it's more than 255

469
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,480
obviously so we can return

470
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,440
written empty this here okay

471
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,919
so

472
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,919
here okay so this part um

473
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,559
any questions about

474
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,960
right

475
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,280
okay okay that's it for today bye bye

476
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,280
bye bye
