00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
so what's sublist
 

15
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,630
so what's sublist
um the continuous thing the continual

16
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
um the continuous thing the continual

one display
 

35
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,869
one display
is one three a service

36
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
is one three a service
 

37
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,110
is one three a service
no

38
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120

[Music]
but it's a subsequent right you got it

42
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
but it's a subsequent right you got it
 

43
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,310
but it's a subsequent right you got it
yeah it's not continuous we have

44
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
yeah it's not continuous we have
 

45
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,389
yeah it's not continuous we have
something is a continue okay so given

46
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
something is a continue okay so given
 

47
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,549
something is a continue okay so given
now today's class is simple given that

48
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
now today's class is simple given that
 

49
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,189
now today's class is simple given that
num at least which is only

50
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
num at least which is only
 

51
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,350
num at least which is only
one containing one and minus one okay

52
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
one containing one and minus one okay
 

53
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,590
one containing one and minus one okay
and one minus one

54
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
and one minus one
 

55
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,229
and one minus one
we want to find out the longest

56
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
we want to find out the longest
 

57
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,670
we want to find out the longest
sublet which has the sum zero

58
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
sublet which has the sum zero
 

59
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,750
sublet which has the sum zero
so in this case what's the longest

60
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
so in this case what's the longest
 

61
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,710
so in this case what's the longest
service

62
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
service
 

63
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,870
service
one minus one minus one minus come on

64
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
one minus one minus one minus come on
 

65
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,510
one minus one minus one minus come on
it's very obvious all of it oh yeah add

66
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
it's very obvious all of it oh yeah add
 

67
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,550
it's very obvious all of it oh yeah add
it together how about this if these and

68
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
it together how about this if these and
 

69
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,550
it together how about this if these and
you need to tell me it's six yeah that

70
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
you need to tell me it's six yeah that
 

71
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,390
you need to tell me it's six yeah that
means six

72
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
means six
 

73
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,710
means six
and how about it only has one what's the

74
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
and how about it only has one what's the
 

75
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,230
and how about it only has one what's the
longest surface

76
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
longest surface
 

77
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,590
longest surface
zero because you can't find it there's

78
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
zero because you can't find it there's
 

79
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,870
zero because you can't find it there's
no minus one it can't be

80
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
no minus one it can't be
 

81
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,070
no minus one it can't be
good job

82
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
good job
 

83
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,990
good job
okay so now

84
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
okay so now
 

85
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,789
okay so now
what's

86
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
what's
 

87
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,630
what's
your approach we want to find the length

88
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
your approach we want to find the length
 

89
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,630
your approach we want to find the length
of longest what's your approach

90
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
of longest what's your approach
 

91
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,230
of longest what's your approach
um

92
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
um
 

93
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,870
um
how do we prove how do we pull first

94
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
how do we prove how do we pull first
 

95
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,950
how do we prove how do we pull first
how do we pull first

96
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
how do we pull first
 

97
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,429
how do we pull first
blue false yes we're done two false

98
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
blue false yes we're done two false
 

99
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,749
blue false yes we're done two false
two first

100
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
two first
 

101
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,670
two first
so we want to check the service can we

102
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
so we want to check the service can we
 

103
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,069
so we want to check the service can we
blue force all the surface and then

104
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
blue force all the surface and then
 

105
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,069
blue force all the surface and then
check the sun right

106
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
check the sun right
 

107
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,550
check the sun right
all right okay so let's do this

108
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
all right okay so let's do this
 

109
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,109
all right okay so let's do this
define

110
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119

 

111
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,310

longest

112
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
longest
 

113
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,469
longest
service

114
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
service
 

115
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,670
service
lungs

116
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680

 

117
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,270

at the beginning we want to have this

118
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
at the beginning we want to have this
 

119
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,430
at the beginning we want to have this
answer answer equals one

120
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440

 

121
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,390

what's the answer

122
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400

 

123
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,390

and will be equals to the lens right

124
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
and will be equals to the lens right
 

125
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,630
and will be equals to the lens right
there's a number

126
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
there's a number
 

127
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,869
there's a number
okay so for

128
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
okay so for
 

129
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,350
okay so for
let's do the left left

130
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
let's do the left left
 

131
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:30,949
let's do the left left
will be i right i in range

132
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959

 

133
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,990

and yeah i i will be from left to here

134
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
and yeah i i will be from left to here
 

135
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,550
and yeah i i will be from left to here
and then when i is determined we want to

136
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
and then when i is determined we want to
 

137
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,470
and then when i is determined we want to
start with j for

138
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
start with j for
 

139
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,990
start with j for
j in range one

140
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000

 

141
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,630

when you are come on i is here j will be

142
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
when you are come on i is here j will be
 

143
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,949
when you are come on i is here j will be
from here to the end right

144
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
from here to the end right
 

145
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,860
from here to the end right
so v one

146
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:51,870

 

147
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,309

[Music]

148
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
[Music]
 

149
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,589
[Music]
okay so now inj is the index

150
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
okay so now inj is the index
 

151
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,830
okay so now inj is the index
of the sub list from the leftmost and

152
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
of the sub list from the leftmost and
 

153
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,309
of the sub list from the leftmost and
the rightmost so how do we calculate the

154
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
the rightmost so how do we calculate the
 

155
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,990
the rightmost so how do we calculate the
sum what's

156
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
sum what's
 

157
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,949
sum what's
how do we

158
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
how do we
 

159
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,550
how do we
what's the subject the subject with nums

160
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
what's the subject the subject with nums
 

161
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,350
what's the subject the subject with nums
nouns i to

162
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
nouns i to
 

163
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,589
nouns i to
um

164
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599

 

165
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,949

do we need to press one yeah so we can

166
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
do we need to press one yeah so we can
 

167
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,270
do we need to press one yeah so we can
use the sum function right

168
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
use the sum function right
 

169
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,149
use the sum function right
how do we calculate ourselves if sum

170
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
how do we calculate ourselves if sum
 

171
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,110
how do we calculate ourselves if sum
equal equal equals zero

172
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
equal equal equals zero
 

173
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,229
equal equal equals zero
and we want to update the answer answer

174
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239

225
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,629

it where's that look

226
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
it where's that look
 

227
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,909
it where's that look
for

228
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
for
 

229
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,430
for
one end

230
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
one end
 

231
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,270
one end
in order to iterate this and loop we

232
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
in order to iterate this and loop we
 

233
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,350
in order to iterate this and loop we
need to iterate another end loops

234
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
need to iterate another end loops
 

235
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,830
need to iterate another end loops
but look there's no n oh and there's no

236
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
but look there's no n oh and there's no
 

237
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:01,510
but look there's no n oh and there's no
loop here why is come on

238
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520

 

239
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,029

okay so look

240
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
okay so look
 

241
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,710
okay so look
we can improve this proof of thing yeah

242
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
we can improve this proof of thing yeah
 

243
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,670
we can improve this proof of thing yeah
we still we see approvals in the past

244
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
we still we see approvals in the past
 

245
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,629
we still we see approvals in the past
but

246
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
but
 

247
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,550
but
instead of every time we sum we

248
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
instead of every time we sum we
 

249
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,710
instead of every time we sum we
calculate the sum of the sub is from the

250
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
calculate the sum of the sub is from the
 

251
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,150
calculate the sum of the sub is from the
star

252
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
star
 

253
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,070

we can do some you know we can

254
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
we can do some you know we can
 

255
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,749
we can do some you know we can
accumulate the answer for

256
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
accumulate the answer for
 

257
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,350
accumulate the answer for
what is that look one

258
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
what is that look one
 

259
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,189
what is that look one
two three four

260
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
two three four
 

261
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,990
two three four
we we are now computing the sublease sum

262
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
we we are now computing the sublease sum
 

263
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,189
we we are now computing the sublease sum
of these

264
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
of these
 

265
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,629
of these
yeah which is what eric

266
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
yeah which is what eric
 

267
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,110
yeah which is what eric
which is what

268
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
which is what
 

269
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,870
which is what
which is three right

270
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
which is three right
 

271
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,749
which is three right
and on the j we move to the next one

272
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
and on the j we move to the next one
 

273
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,350
and on the j we move to the next one
alright look

274
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
alright look
 

275
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,990
alright look
j we move next one to here so what's the

276
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
j we move next one to here so what's the
 

277
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,310
j we move next one to here so what's the
subject sum of this new array one two

278
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
subject sum of this new array one two
 

279
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,110
subject sum of this new array one two
three

280
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120

 

281
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,550

six yeah

282
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
six yeah
 

283
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,310
six yeah
how do you get a six

284
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
how do you get a six
 

285
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,029
how do you get a six
how do you get the six

286
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
how do you get the six
 

287
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,550
how do you get the six
well you already know this is three yeah

288
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
well you already know this is three yeah
 

289
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,070
well you already know this is three yeah
it's three plus three

290
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
it's three plus three
 

291
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,110
it's three plus three
right

292
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
right
 

293
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,950
right
you use we use the three you are not

294
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
you use we use the three you are not
 

295
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,189
you use we use the three you are not
doing this with one plus two plus me

296
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
doing this with one plus two plus me
 

297
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,510
doing this with one plus two plus me
again you're not doing this again right

298
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
again you're not doing this again right
 

299
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,390
again you're not doing this again right
the previous method is slow because

300
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
the previous method is slow because
 

301
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,230
the previous method is slow because
you will be calculating this speed again

302
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
you will be calculating this speed again
 

303
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,029
you will be calculating this speed again
but

304
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
but
 

305
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,870
but
we don't need to be calculated again

306
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
we don't need to be calculated again
 

307
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,790
we don't need to be calculated again
because here we all already know is

308
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
because here we all already know is
 

309
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,309
because here we all already know is
three so

310
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
three so
 

311
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,110
three so
we add a new we add a new number to the

312
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
we add a new we add a new number to the
 

313
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,230
we add a new we add a new number to the

we just
 

317
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,110
we just
accumulate the answer so

318
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
accumulate the answer so
 

319
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,390

we put the x equals zero

322
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
we put the x equals zero
 

323
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,189
we put the x equals zero
and what should i do here

324
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
n square whether so which one is better
 

349
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,810
n square whether so which one is better
now

350
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:03,820
now
 

351
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,110
now
[Music]

352
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
[Music]
 

353
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,070
[Music]
yeah we need to improve yeah

354
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
yeah we need to improve yeah
 

355
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,350
yeah we need to improve yeah
okay so this is on cubic on square these

356
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
okay so this is on cubic on square these
 

357
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,830
okay so this is on cubic on square these
two are both proof of things because we

358
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
two are both proof of things because we
 

359
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,390
two are both proof of things because we
are trying every possible uh possible

360
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
are trying every possible uh possible
 

361
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,390
are trying every possible uh possible
surface yeah we

362
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
surface yeah we
 

363
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,029
surface yeah we
we first determine the left and then we

364
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
we first determine the left and then we
 

365
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,350
we first determine the left and then we
start right yeah and then we compare the

366
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
start right yeah and then we compare the
 

367
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,110
start right yeah and then we compare the
sum of these the subjects

368
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
sum of these the subjects
 

369
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,670
sum of these the subjects
do you still remember the basic sum

370
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
do you still remember the basic sum
 

371
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,670
do you still remember the basic sum

eighteen you're just taking it yeah yeah
 

389
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,710
eighteen you're just taking it yeah yeah
i didn't

390
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
i didn't
 

391
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,790
i didn't
three plus four plus five five six yeah

392
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
three plus four plus five five six yeah
 

393
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,070
three plus four plus five five six yeah
this is one way which is all

394
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
this is one way which is all
 

395
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,150
this is one way which is all
okay and then how do you get it

396
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160

 

397
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,390

ah okay okay so that's what i'm going to

398
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
ah okay okay so that's what i'm going to
 

399
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,309
ah okay okay so that's what i'm going to
take what's the thank you brexit if

400
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
take what's the thank you brexit if
 

401
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,150
take what's the thank you brexit if
you're calculating this blue forcing

402
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
you're calculating this blue forcing
 

403
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,990
you're calculating this blue forcing
just try you know adding the numbers

404
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
just try you know adding the numbers
 

405
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,430
just try you know adding the numbers
from the left from a given range

406
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
from the left from a given range
 

407
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,670
from the left from a given range
come on what's the time complexity if i

408
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
come on what's the time complexity if i
 

409
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,589
come on what's the time complexity if i
give you a range and i want to kick it i

410
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
give you a range and i want to kick it i
 

411
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,309
give you a range and i want to kick it i
want you to calculate some of this range

412
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
want you to calculate some of this range
 

413
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,830
want you to calculate some of this range
what what's the thumbnail velocity

414
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840

 

415
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,390

oh and yeah because in the worst case it

416
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
oh and yeah because in the worst case it
 

417
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,909
oh and yeah because in the worst case it
would be n numbers yeah you need to do

418
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
would be n numbers yeah you need to do
 

419
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,149
would be n numbers yeah you need to do
it again and again but we can turn this

420
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
it again and again but we can turn this
 

421
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,269
it again and again but we can turn this
into the

422
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
into the
 

423
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,589
into the
previous sum remember remember this

424
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
previous sum remember remember this
 

425
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,230
previous sum remember remember this
accumulator accumulate function this is

426
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
accumulator accumulate function this is
 

427
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,870
accumulator accumulate function this is
a for example and then accumulate a this

428
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
a for example and then accumulate a this
 

429
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,550
a for example and then accumulate a this
accumulate a

accumulate yeah
 

433
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,949
accumulate yeah
what's the accumulator mean

434
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959

 

435
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,550

accumulating you know i think together

436
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
accumulating you know i think together
 

437
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,790
accumulating you know i think together
accumulate yeah putting together so this

438
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
accumulate yeah putting together so this
 

439
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,230
accumulate yeah putting together so this
accumulate a will be what will be

440
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
accumulate a will be what will be
 

441
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,310
accumulate a will be what will be
one

442
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
one
 

443
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,509
one
one

444
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
one
 

445
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,350
one
one plus two three

446
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
one plus two three
 

447
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,350
one plus two three
one plus two plus three

448
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
one plus two plus three
 

449
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,630
one plus two plus three
six

450
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
six
 

451
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,670
six
ten

452
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
ten
 

453
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,389
ten
yeah

454
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
yeah
 

455
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,310
yeah
and then 15 i think together 21 21 s7

456
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320

 

457
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,070

36 45

458
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080

 

459
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,790

the sum of these four

460
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
the sum of these four
 

461
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,870
the sum of these four
is it the sum between

462
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
is it the sum between
 

463
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,389
is it the sum between
how many numbers this four number yeah

464
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
how many numbers this four number yeah
 

465
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,070
how many numbers this four number yeah
the sum of this whole number is it the

466
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
the sum of this whole number is it the
 

467
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,550
the sum of this whole number is it the
same as the sum of

468
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
same as the sum of
 

469
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,389
same as the sum of
of these

470
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
of these
 

471
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,310
of these
six numbers yeah

472
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
six numbers yeah
 

473
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,630
six numbers yeah
yeah this 21 is the first six numbers

474
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
yeah this 21 is the first six numbers
 

475
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,790
yeah this 21 is the first six numbers
and then minus the sum of the first two

476
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
and then minus the sum of the first two
 

477
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,470
and then minus the sum of the first two
numbers right

478
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
numbers right
 

479
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,710
numbers right
correct

480
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
correct
 

481
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,230
correct
yeah

482
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
yeah
 

483
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,389
yeah
the first number is 21. the first two

484
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
the first number is 21. the first two
 

485
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,430
the first number is 21. the first two
numbers is three

486
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440

 

487
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,430

so what's that

488
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
so what's that
 

489
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,670
so what's that
eighteen right is it eighteen three plus

490
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
eighteen right is it eighteen three plus
 

491
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,910
eighteen right is it eighteen three plus
four seven seven plus five two of two

492
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
four seven seven plus five two of two
 

493
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,910
four seven seven plus five two of two
plus six eighteen what's the term

494
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
plus six eighteen what's the term
 

495
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,070
plus six eighteen what's the term
complexity is this is given they

496
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
complexity is this is given they
 

497
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,790
complexity is this is given they
accumulate this prefix sum is given

498
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800

 

499
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,509

yeah because we we just need to look at

500
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
yeah because we we just need to look at
 

501
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,389
yeah because we we just need to look at
the tables look at this preview exam

502
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
the tables look at this preview exam
 

503
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,870
the tables look at this preview exam
pick these numbers pick this number

504
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
pick these numbers pick this number
 

505
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,190
pick these numbers pick this number
subtract and we got the answer this is

506
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
subtract and we got the answer this is
 

507
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,350
subtract and we got the answer this is
better right this is faster right

508
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
better right this is faster right
 

509
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,509
better right this is faster right
yeah because we are using the numbers

510
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
yeah because we are using the numbers
 

511
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,230
yeah because we are using the numbers
we're using the arrays uh the numbers

512
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
we're using the arrays uh the numbers
 

513
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,949
we're using the arrays uh the numbers
the the sum we have calculate we have no

514
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
the the sum we have calculate we have no
 

515
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,990
the the sum we have calculate we have no
one right

516
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
one right
 

517
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,150
one right
okay so now based on this prefix now we

518
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
okay so now based on this prefix now we
 

519
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,910
okay so now based on this prefix now we
can actually

520
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920

 

521
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,310

we can actually uh solve this problem in

522
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
we can actually uh solve this problem in
 

523
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,829
we can actually uh solve this problem in
o n right

524
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
o n right
 

525
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,269
o n right
so how do we solve this we can actually

526
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,279
so how do we solve this we can actually
 

527
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,750
so how do we solve this we can actually
uh

528
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760

 

529
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,470

going through these numbers

530
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
going through these numbers
 

531
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,790
going through these numbers
and then if the sum we remember the

532
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
and then if the sum we remember the
 

533
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,430
and then if the sum we remember the
prefix sum in the dictionary

534
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
prefix sum in the dictionary
 

535
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,550
prefix sum in the dictionary
right

536
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
right
 

537
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,949
right
yeah we remember that this uh prefix

538
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
yeah we remember that this uh prefix
 

539
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,350
yeah we remember that this uh prefix
term in addition and if it's already

540
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
term in addition and if it's already
 

541
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,790
term in addition and if it's already
appear

542
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
appear
 

543
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,110
appear
then we can we can substitute the

544
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
then we can we can substitute the
 

545
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,550
then we can we can substitute the
distance and then

546
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
distance and then
 

547
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,150
distance and then
we

548
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
we
 

549
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,230
we
store the maximum and if not then we put

550
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
store the maximum and if not then we put
 

551
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,230
store the maximum and if not then we put
it in a hash table okay so let's do this

552
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
it in a hash table okay so let's do this
 

553
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,269
it in a hash table okay so let's do this
define

554
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
define
 

555
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,069
define
okay let's call it full okay

556
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
okay let's call it full okay
 

557
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,949
okay let's call it full okay
you know computer full and bar yeah foo

558
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
you know computer full and bar yeah foo
 

559
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,509
you know computer full and bar yeah foo
by in case you don't know what how to

560
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
by in case you don't know what how to
 

561
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,310
by in case you don't know what how to
rename your functions your variable you

562
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
rename your functions your variable you
 

563
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,150
rename your functions your variable you
can always give this to them yeah so and

564
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
can always give this to them yeah so and
 

565
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,150
can always give this to them yeah so and
by it's easy it's easy to write it's

566
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
by it's easy it's easy to write it's
 

567
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,990
by it's easy it's easy to write it's
easy to pronounce right

568
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
easy to pronounce right
 

569
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,670
easy to pronounce right
yeah

570
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
yeah
 

571
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,269
yeah
okay

572
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
okay
 

573
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,269
okay
okay so now we will put it in this

574
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
okay so now we will put it in this
 

575
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,870
okay so now we will put it in this
addition the prefix sound let's say

576
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
addition the prefix sound let's say
 

577
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,150
addition the prefix sound let's say
prefix

578
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
prefix
 

579
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,030
prefix
prefix equal at the beginning we put it

580
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
prefix equal at the beginning we put it
 

581
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,790
prefix equal at the beginning we put it
in a different dictionary

582
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
in a different dictionary
 

583
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,269
in a different dictionary
uh not in a dictionary okay but i'm

584
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
uh not in a dictionary okay but i'm
 

585
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,350
uh not in a dictionary okay but i'm
going to put a 0 here a minus 1 i'll

586
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
going to put a 0 here a minus 1 i'll
 

587
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,069
going to put a 0 here a minus 1 i'll
show you why i put a 0 to minus 1. so

588
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
show you why i put a 0 to minus 1. so
 

589
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,509
show you why i put a 0 to minus 1. so
look for

590
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
look for
 

591
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,470
look for
the answer would be 0 right

592
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
the answer would be 0 right
 

593
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,230
the answer would be 0 right
the answer will be 0.

594
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
the answer will be 0.
 

595
00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:04,470
the answer will be 0.
okay okay come on four

596
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480

 

597
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,509

let's do it what's in your remember

you just print each letter yeah so

646
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
you just print each letter yeah so
 

647
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,230
you just print each letter yeah so
you're between e and one nine are i see

you'll probably do something better
 

651
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,670
you'll probably do something better
how about if i say print for i

652

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,710
i would be from zero
uh

688
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
uh
 

689
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,350
uh
incrementing yeah and n will be actually

690
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
incrementing yeah and n will be actually
 

691
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,629
incrementing yeah and n will be actually
very well

692
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
very well
 

693
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,550
very well
so now we have this

694
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
so now we have this
 

695
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,870
so now we have this
let's have this uh

696
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
let's have this uh
 

697
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,189
let's have this uh
current answer okay current

698
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
current answer okay current
 

699
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,389
current answer okay current
equals zero

700
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
equals zero
 

701
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,670
equals zero
current plus equals ion

702
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
current plus equals ion
 

703
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,590
current plus equals ion
current plus equal ion

704
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
current plus equal ion
 

705
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,949
current plus equal ion
we want to pass the sound sound sun

706
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
we want to pass the sound sound sun
 

707
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,110
we want to pass the sound sound sun
sum so we plus what right

708
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
sum so we plus what right
 

709
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,910
sum so we plus what right
we plus n right and now we we have the

710
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
we plus n right and now we we have the
 

711
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,550
we plus n right and now we we have the
this is the prefix sum of the the first

712
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
this is the prefix sum of the the first
 

713
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,550
this is the prefix sum of the the first
uh you know

714
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
uh you know
 

715
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,150
uh you know
first few numbers

716
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
first few numbers
 

717
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,629
first few numbers
and then we just do if look if this

718
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
and then we just do if look if this
 

719
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,030
and then we just do if look if this
current equal equal zero what does it

720
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
current equal equal zero what does it
 

721
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,310
current equal equal zero what does it
mean

722
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
mean
 

723
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,629
mean
anyway

724
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639
anyway
 

725
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,470
anyway
if the current equals zero

726
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
if the current equals zero
 

727
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,590
if the current equals zero
column

728
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
column
 

729
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,590
column
yeah i know what does it mean

730
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
yeah i know what does it mean
 

731
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,470
yeah i know what does it mean
it means that currently from the start

732
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:44,480
it means that currently from the start
 

733
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,030
it means that currently from the start
to the current position look at that

734
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
to the current position look at that
 

735
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,030
to the current position look at that
from the current from the beginning look

736
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
from the current from the beginning look
 

737
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,949
from the current from the beginning look
one look at this if this array is one

738
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
one look at this if this array is one
 

739
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,790
one look at this if this array is one
minus one y minus one

740
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
minus one y minus one
 

741
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,710
minus one y minus one
one minus one okay

742
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720

 

743
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,110

if at this point we have this sum one

744
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
if at this point we have this sum one
 

745
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,710
if at this point we have this sum one
minus one zero one plus minus one zero

746
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
minus one zero one plus minus one zero
 

747
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,949
minus one zero one plus minus one zero
right if this column equals zero what

748
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
right if this column equals zero what
 

749
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,629
right if this column equals zero what
does it mean

750
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
does it mean
 

751
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,949
does it mean
it means the longest the surface sum is

752
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
it means the longest the surface sum is
 

753
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,509
it means the longest the surface sum is
zero is from which place from the start

754
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
zero is from which place from the start
 

755
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,110
zero is from which place from the start
right yeah

756
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
right yeah
 

757
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,790
right yeah
so now we could just do this answer

758
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
so now we could just do this answer
 

759
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,670
so now we could just do this answer
would be equals i plus one right

760
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
would be equals i plus one right
 

761
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,150
would be equals i plus one right
all right look

762
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
all right look
 

763
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,030
all right look
yeah

764
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
yeah
 

765
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,710
yeah
then we can do this if current

766
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
then we can do this if current
 

767
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,910
then we can do this if current
in p

768
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920

 

769
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,150

if current in p

770
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
if current in p
 

771
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,030
if current in p
if if column in p what what do we do we

772
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
if if column in p what what do we do we
 

773
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,470
if if column in p what what do we do we
we

774
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
we
 

775
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,990
we
if current in p so p current it stores

776
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
if current in p so p current it stores
 

777
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,350
if current in p so p current it stores
the previous

778
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
the previous
 

779
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,389
the previous
subject sum of previous uh summary sum

780
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
subject sum of previous uh summary sum
 

781
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,430
subject sum of previous uh summary sum
of current index right so the answer

782
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
of current index right so the answer
 

783
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,189
of current index right so the answer
will be maximum

784
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:47,199
will be maximum
 

785
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,949
will be maximum
of answer

786
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
of answer
 

787
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,829
of answer
what current index is i right

788
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839

 

789
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,030

right so why this is working look if uh

790
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
right so why this is working look if uh
 

791
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,829
right so why this is working look if uh
if there are two sub is sum if if the

792
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
if there are two sub is sum if if the
 

793
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,069
if there are two sub is sum if if the
two previous sum is the same

794
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
two previous sum is the same
 

795
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,670
two previous sum is the same
now what does it mean

796
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
now what does it mean
 

797
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,829
now what does it mean
if two perfect sum is the same

798
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:06,839
if two perfect sum is the same
 

799
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,910
if two perfect sum is the same
then the this the lens

800
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920

 

801
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,069

if i draw it look this way

802
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
if i draw it look this way
 

803
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,949
if i draw it look this way
okay

804
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
okay
 

805
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,350
okay
this the from the beginning to here this

806
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
this the from the beginning to here this
 

807
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,389
this the from the beginning to here this
is 100 uh this is means uh

808
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:20,399
is 100 uh this is means uh
 

809
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,350
is 100 uh this is means uh
uh

810
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
uh
 

811
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,949
uh
yeah right

812
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
yeah right
 

813
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,030
yeah right
and then another i thought later i found

814
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
and then another i thought later i found
 

815
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,829
and then another i thought later i found
out this is also zero the sum of

816
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
out this is also zero the sum of
 

817
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,230
out this is also zero the sum of
uh

818
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240

 

819
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,310

maybe i put it somewhere this is the sum

820
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,320
maybe i put it somewhere this is the sum
 

821
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,910
maybe i put it somewhere this is the sum
of from

822
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
of from
 

823
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,790
of from
at the beginning to this point i

824
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
at the beginning to this point i
 

825
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,629
at the beginning to this point i
is a hundred

826
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
is a hundred
 

827
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,590
is a hundred
and then i found out later j here

828
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
and then i found out later j here
 

829
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,670
and then i found out later j here
the beginning from

830
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
the beginning from
 

831
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,269
the beginning from
the beginning to j

832
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
the beginning to j
 

833
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,350
the beginning to j
yeah j is bigger than i it's also a

834
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
yeah j is bigger than i it's also a
 

835
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,870
yeah j is bigger than i it's also a
hundred what does it mean

836
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
hundred what does it mean
 

837
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,710
hundred what does it mean
the sum between the beginning don't be

838
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
the sum between the beginning don't be
 

839
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,670
the sum between the beginning don't be
bigger

840
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
bigger
 

841
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,470
bigger
no no no no no look the sum between the

842
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
no no no no no look the sum between the
 

843
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,470
no no no no no look the sum between the
sum of this range the numbers in

844
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
sum of this range the numbers in
 

845
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,910
sum of this range the numbers in
distance is 100 and the sum of these 100

846
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
distance is 100 and the sum of these 100
 

847
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,910
distance is 100 and the sum of these 100
these trends is also hundred what does

848
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:03,920
these trends is also hundred what does
 

849
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,270
these trends is also hundred what does
it mean can you tell me what was it

850
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
it mean can you tell me what was it
 

851
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,870
it mean can you tell me what was it
what's it mean what needs to be more

852
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
what's it mean what needs to be more
 

853
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,669
what's it mean what needs to be more
here

854
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
here
 

855
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,990
here
more what do you mean because

856
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
more what do you mean because
 

857
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,470
more what do you mean because
you know that i did not

858
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
you know that i did not
 

859
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,630
you know that i did not
no no no because this could be one and

860
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
no no no because this could be one and
 

861
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,789
no no no because this could be one and
minus one it could be so what i'm saying

862
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:16,799
minus one it could be so what i'm saying
 

863
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,270
minus one it could be so what i'm saying
is that the re the sum the previous sum

864
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
is that the re the sum the previous sum
 

865
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,630
is that the re the sum the previous sum
yeah the sum between zero to index i is

866
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
yeah the sum between zero to index i is
 

867
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,350
yeah the sum between zero to index i is
a hundred yeah let's say under and the

868
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
a hundred yeah let's say under and the
 

869
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,750
a hundred yeah let's say under and the
sum between zero to j

870
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
sum between zero to j
 

871
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,710
sum between zero to j
is also a hundred i and j are the same

872
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
is also a hundred i and j are the same
 

873
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,870
is also a hundred i and j are the same
no no because

874
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
no no because
 

875
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,270
no no because
i enjoy j is bigger than i what does it

876
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
i enjoy j is bigger than i what does it
 

877
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,390
i enjoy j is bigger than i what does it
mean

878
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
mean
 

879
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,470
mean
it means that it means

880
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480

 

881
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,549

no it can be start from zero so what

882
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
no it can be start from zero so what
 

883
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,750
no it can be start from zero so what
happened here

884
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760
happened here
 

885
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,990
happened here
what happened here what's the sum here

886
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
what happened here what's the sum here
 

887
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,630
what happened here what's the sum here
zero good point yeah because the sum

888
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
zero good point yeah because the sum
 

889
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,789
zero good point yeah because the sum
over here is zero that's why

890
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
over here is zero that's why
 

891
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,710
over here is zero that's why
at it zero

892
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
at it zero
 

893
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,990
at it zero
oh yeah so what so this is the

894
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,000
oh yeah so what so this is the
 

895
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,430
oh yeah so what so this is the
length of the

896
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
length of the
 

897
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,830
length of the
zero summit

898
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:58,840
zero summit
 

899
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,270
zero summit
yeah it yes so we just need to calculate

900
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
yeah it yes so we just need to calculate
 

901
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,990
yeah it yes so we just need to calculate
the j minus i yeah correct yes that's

902
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
the j minus i yeah correct yes that's
 

903
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,029
the j minus i yeah correct yes that's
right yeah okay so so

904
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
right yeah okay so so
 

905
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,430
right yeah okay so so
look i here is i

906
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
look i here is i
 

907
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,390
look i here is i
minus p current okay

908
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
minus p current okay
 

909
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,430
minus p current okay
and then

910
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
and then
 

911
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,310
and then
as what as if current is not in p what

912
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
as what as if current is not in p what
 

913
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,590
as what as if current is not in p what
do we do

914
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
do we do
 

915
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,029
do we do
current is another thinking and p

916
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,039
current is another thinking and p
 

917
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,270
current is another thinking and p
current equals r

918
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
current equals r
 

919
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,789
current equals r
because what come on

920
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
because what come on
 

921
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,190
because what come on
tell me what we we need to store the

922
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
tell me what we we need to store the
 

923
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,870
tell me what we we need to store the
index right

924
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
index right
 

925
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,590
index right
which one is index

926
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
which one is index
 

927
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,870
which one is index
i all right let's see so you see

928
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:32,880
i all right let's see so you see
 

929
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,190
i all right let's see so you see
if current equal and here we don't need

930
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
if current equal and here we don't need
 

931
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,190
if current equal and here we don't need
to put it here right

932
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
to put it here right
 

933
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,190
to put it here right
look this is very tricky if currently

934
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
look this is very tricky if currently
 

935
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,470
look this is very tricky if currently
equals zero

936
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
equals zero
 

937
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,870
equals zero
because if current is zero answer will

938
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
because if current is zero answer will
 

939
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,029
because if current is zero answer will
be i plus one why is that because

940
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
be i plus one why is that because
 

941
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,430
be i plus one why is that because
this current is the sum between the

942
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
this current is the sum between the
 

943
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,470
this current is the sum between the
beginning

944
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
beginning
 

945
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,390
beginning
yeah in the beginning

946
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,400
yeah in the beginning
 

947
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,590
yeah in the beginning
so if it's a zero you can't find any

948
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
so if it's a zero you can't find any
 

949
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,870
so if it's a zero you can't find any
longest

950
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
longest
 

951
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,390
longest
zero

952
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
zero
 

953
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,710
zero
from beginning to current right right

954
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
from beginning to current right right
 

955
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,630
from beginning to current right right
it's always bigger right

956
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
it's always bigger right
 

957
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,029
it's always bigger right
correct look you have a number yeah you

958
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:03,039
correct look you have a number yeah you
 

959
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,110
correct look you have a number yeah you
have number you're going to

960
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
have number you're going to
 

961
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,789
have number you're going to
the beginning this is current sum

962
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
the beginning this is current sum
 

963
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,070
the beginning this is current sum
current will add the sum here sum here

964
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080

 

965
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,310

look at me if at this point this is

966
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
look at me if at this point this is
 

967
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,470
look at me if at this point this is
yellow we found out this is yellow can

968
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
yellow we found out this is yellow can
 

969
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,870
yellow we found out this is yellow can
you find any subway some bigger than the

970
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
you find any subway some bigger than the
 

971
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,150
you find any subway some bigger than the
here you can right yes because i this is

972
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
here you can right yes because i this is
 

973
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,390
here you can right yes because i this is
already the largest the biggest so i set

974
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
already the largest the biggest so i set
 

975
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,310
already the largest the biggest so i set
it to i plus one right because stuff is

976
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
it to i plus one right because stuff is
 

977
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,070
it to i plus one right because stuff is
zero so the length will be i plus one

978
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,080
zero so the length will be i plus one
 

979
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,029
zero so the length will be i plus one
right okay and if we can remove this we

980
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
right okay and if we can remove this we
 

981
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,870
right okay and if we can remove this we
can remove this

982
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
can remove this
 

983
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,510
can remove this
and instead of here i can put a zero key

984
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
and instead of here i can put a zero key
 

985
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,750
and instead of here i can put a zero key
zero something some zero i could minus

986
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760
zero something some zero i could minus
 

987
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,549
zero something some zero i could minus
one

988
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
one
 

989
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,549
one
yeah got it

990
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
yeah got it
 

991
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,029
yeah got it
okay so this will be simplified yeah

992
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
okay so this will be simplified yeah
 

993
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,190
okay so this will be simplified yeah
this is one one way so this is what's

994
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
this is one one way so this is what's
 

995
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,870
this is one one way so this is what's
the time complexity

996
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:46,880
the time complexity
 

997
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,150
the time complexity
come on it should be easy what's the

998
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,160
come on it should be easy what's the
 

999
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,590
come on it should be easy what's the
timing recipe

1000
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
timing recipe
 

1001
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,350
timing recipe
yeah we're just going to once there's

1002
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
yeah we're just going to once there's
 

1003
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,510
yeah we're just going to once there's
nothing here what's the space capacity

1004
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520

 

1005
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,470

there has to be some cost right

1006
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
there has to be some cost right
 

1007
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,549
there has to be some cost right
how do we trade the

1008
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
how do we trade the
 

1009
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,750
how do we trade the
time for

1010
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
time for
 

1011
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,789
time for
what

1012
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
what
 

1013
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,430
what
how do we achieve a when

1014
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
how do we achieve a when
 

1015
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,750
how do we achieve a when
with the help of what which data

1016
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:07,760
with the help of what which data
 

1017
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,590
with the help of what which data
structure oh and yeah

1018
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
structure oh and yeah
 

1019
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,310
structure oh and yeah
you see o and square o and cubic i want

1020
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
you see o and square o and cubic i want
 

1021
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,750
you see o and square o and cubic i want
qp os it's slow but it doesn't use any

1022
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,760
qp os it's slow but it doesn't use any
 

1023
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,510
qp os it's slow but it doesn't use any
space the state complexity for these two

1024
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
space the state complexity for these two
 

1025
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,149
space the state complexity for these two
is one yeah because then but now we're

1026
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,159
is one yeah because then but now we're
 

1027
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,070
is one yeah because then but now we're
using o in space

1028
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
using o in space
 

1029
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,110
using o in space
we're using the space to trade

1030
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
we're using the space to trade
 

1031
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,430
we're using the space to trade
the time right okay

1032
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,440
the time right okay
 

1033
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,310
the time right okay
okay another way another uh algorithm

1034
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
okay another way another uh algorithm
 

1035
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,430
okay another way another uh algorithm
i'm not going to

1036
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
i'm not going to
 

1037
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,870
i'm not going to
talk too much here okay is that

1038
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
talk too much here okay is that
 

1039
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,789
talk too much here okay is that
we can store the prefix

1040
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:36,799
we can store the prefix
 

1041
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,270
we can store the prefix
we can store each prefix and then each

1042
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
we can store each prefix and then each
 

1043
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,390
we can store each prefix and then each
prefix we will uh we store the index of

1044
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
prefix we will uh we store the index of
 

1045
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,270
prefix we will uh we store the index of
it

1046
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
it
 

1047
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,510
it
so

1048
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520

 

1049
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,990

so it'll be something like uh let's

1050
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
so it'll be something like uh let's
 

1051
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,830
so it'll be something like uh let's
let's try this quickly write this okay

1052
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
let's try this quickly write this okay
 

1053
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,270
let's try this quickly write this okay

accumulated function

1068
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:04,799
accumulated function
 

1069
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,230
accumulated function
we can use these accumulated numbers

1070
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
we can use these accumulated numbers
 

1071
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,950
we can use these accumulated numbers
right and then now what do i do with

1072
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
right and then now what do i do with
 

1073
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,630
right and then now what do i do with
this accumulator because i already have

1074
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640
this accumulator because i already have
 

1075
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,669
this accumulator because i already have
this say okay uh i also need to put

1076
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
this say okay uh i also need to put
 

1077
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,310
this say okay uh i also need to put
these in a uh

1078
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
these in a uh
 

1079
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,870
these in a uh
i also need to put this in a scene in a

1080
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
i also need to put this in a scene in a
 

1081
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,590
i also need to put this in a scene in a
hash table okay so sim let's say c

1082
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
hash table okay so sim let's say c
 

1083
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,870
hash table okay so sim let's say c
equals

1084
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:24,880
equals
 

1085
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,149
equals
uh default dictionary

1086
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
uh default dictionary
 

1087
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,669
uh default dictionary
no but

1088
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:29,679
no but
 

1089
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,909
no but
thing is the prefix because in the

1090
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919
thing is the prefix because in the
 

1091
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,270
thing is the prefix because in the
prefix sum

1092
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
prefix sum
 

1093
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,430
prefix sum
and then the key key will be the prefix

1094
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
and then the key key will be the prefix
 

1095
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,789
and then the key key will be the prefix
sum the value will be the list of index

1096
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
sum the value will be the list of index
 

1097
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,870
sum the value will be the list of index
yeah it could be many as i said look it

1098
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:40,880
yeah it could be many as i said look it
 

1099
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,430
yeah it could be many as i said look it
could be from zero to i it could be sum

1100
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
could be from zero to i it could be sum
 

1101
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,390
could be from zero to i it could be sum
of 100 and from 0 to j you'll be sum of

1102
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
of 100 and from 0 to j you'll be sum of
 

1103
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,950
of 100 and from 0 to j you'll be sum of
100 as well so the key will be 100 and

1104
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:48,960
100 as well so the key will be 100 and
 

1105
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,590
100 as well so the key will be 100 and
the value will be the index which is

1106
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
the value will be the index which is
 

1107
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,669
the value will be the index which is
index array will be i j right so

1108
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,679
index array will be i j right so
 

1109
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,909
index array will be i j right so
deposition released

1110
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:55,919
deposition released
 

1111
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,110
deposition released
list integer right this is so the key is

1112
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,120
list integer right this is so the key is
 

1113
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,149
list integer right this is so the key is
the sum the previous sum the value is

1114
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
the sum the previous sum the value is
 

1115
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,750
the sum the previous sum the value is
the index

1116
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
the index
 

1117
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,590
the index
okay so now i just need to go through

1118
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600
okay so now i just need to go through
 

1119
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,470
okay so now i just need to go through
the the prefix for i

1120
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
the the prefix for i
 

1121
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,350
the the prefix for i
in

1122
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,360
in
 

1123
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,950
in
prefix

1124
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:10,960
prefix
 

1125
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,470

okay and then i can say c

1128
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
okay and then i can say c
 

1129
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,990
okay and then i can say c
i

1130

answer

1190
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
answer
 

1191
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,909
answer
can you imagine how to uh why this will

1192
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
can you imagine how to uh why this will
 

1193
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,390
can you imagine how to uh why this will
work why this will work

1194
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400

 

1195
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,390

what is work

1196
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
what is work
 

1197
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,990
what is work
so

1198
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
so
 

1199
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,110
so
so what as i said look

1200
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,120
so what as i said look
 

1201
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,669
so what as i said look
i i talked about this before

1202
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
i i talked about this before
 

1203
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,630
i i talked about this before
from 0 to here that would be i used to

1204
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:36,640
from 0 to here that would be i used to
 

1205
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,590
from 0 to here that would be i used to
be i

1206
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
be i
 

1207
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,149
be i
also here will be j right so look if

1208
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:40,159
also here will be j right so look if
 

1209
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,110
also here will be j right so look if
this is

1210
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
this is
 

1211
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,710
this is
if this is the

1212
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
if this is the
 

1213
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,710
if this is the
uh sub and the prefix sound alright look

1214
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
uh sub and the prefix sound alright look
 

1215
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,549
uh sub and the prefix sound alright look
look at me

1216
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
look at me
 

1217
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,909
look at me
see this if this is the sum s here right

1218
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:49,919
see this if this is the sum s here right
 

1219
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,149
see this if this is the sum s here right
and then this is some also the s right

1220
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159
and then this is some also the s right
 

1221
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,909
and then this is some also the s right
so the previous the scene

1222
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:53,919
so the previous the scene
 

1223
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,950
so the previous the scene
scene

1224
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
scene
 

1225
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,870
scene
s will be

1226
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
s will be
 

1227
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,630
s will be
two there will be a

1228
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
two there will be a
 

1229
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,510
two there will be a
list of i and j right suppose like that

1230
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
list of i and j right suppose like that
 

1231
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,070
list of i and j right suppose like that
and the length will be j minus one right

1232
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
and the length will be j minus one right
 

1233
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,549
and the length will be j minus one right
yeah okay so i just need to calculate

1234
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
yeah okay so i just need to calculate
 

1235
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,750
yeah okay so i just need to calculate
this this video you see this is exactly

1236
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
this this video you see this is exactly
 

1237
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,390
this this video you see this is exactly
what i've told before yeah so first of

1238
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
what i've told before yeah so first of
 

1239
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,710
what i've told before yeah so first of
all i kick away look at me i calculated

1240
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
all i kick away look at me i calculated
 

1241
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,909
all i kick away look at me i calculated
the s the prefix sum the the prefix sum

1242
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:17,919
the s the prefix sum the the prefix sum
 

1243
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,950
the s the prefix sum the the prefix sum
uh and i store the same prefix sum the

1244
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
uh and i store the same prefix sum the
 

1245
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,350
uh and i store the same prefix sum the
index of previous sum to an array and i

1246
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
index of previous sum to an array and i
 

1247
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,029
index of previous sum to an array and i
go through this thing and the previous

1248
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:25,039
go through this thing and the previous
 

1249
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,390
go through this thing and the previous
exam

1250
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,400
exam
 

1251
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,310
exam
right this is the sum and i go through

1252
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
right this is the sum and i go through
 

1253
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,430
right this is the sum and i go through
the index and in the length

1254
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
the index and in the length
 

1255
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,590
the index and in the length
the the length of zero summary sum will

1256
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
the the length of zero summary sum will
 

1257
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,310
the the length of zero summary sum will
be the the larger because this index

1258
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320
be the the larger because this index
 

1259
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,870
be the the larger because this index
array is the incrementing is is sorted

1260
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
array is the incrementing is is sorted
 

1261
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,110
array is the incrementing is is sorted
so i just have to what's minus one sin

1262
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
so i just have to what's minus one sin
 

1263
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,710
so i just have to what's minus one sin
at minus one what's that what's this

1264
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,720
at minus one what's that what's this
 

1265
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,789
at minus one what's that what's this
value scene i minus one where is it

1266
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:48,799

 

1267
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,990

what sin i seen s minus one which one is

1268
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
what sin i seen s minus one which one is
 

1269
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,630
what sin i seen s minus one which one is
i or j which one is minus one

1270
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,640

 

1271
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,110

i minus one what does it mean

1272
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
i minus one what does it mean
 

1273
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,590
i minus one what does it mean
the index minus one the

1274
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
the index minus one the
 

1275
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,870
the index minus one the
which one

1276
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
which one
 

1277
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,149
which one
um

1278
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
um
 

1279
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,710
um
yeah the j and then i zero is this one

1280
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
yeah the j and then i zero is this one
 

1281
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,549
yeah the j and then i zero is this one
yeah that's what i mean so it could be

1282
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
yeah that's what i mean so it could be
 

1283
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,510
yeah that's what i mean so it could be
any it would be another one i increa

1284
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
any it would be another one i increa
 

1285
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,710
any it would be another one i increa
it could be

1286
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:12,720
it could be
 

1287
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,029
it could be
a b c you know there will be four

1288
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
a b c you know there will be four
 

1289
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,269
a b c you know there will be four
indexes so in this case it would be d

1290
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:17,279
indexes so in this case it would be d
 

1291
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,909
indexes so in this case it would be d
minus a right this is the largest

1292
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
minus a right this is the largest
 

1293
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,909
minus a right this is the largest
uh sublist okay what's the time

1294
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
uh sublist okay what's the time
 

1295
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,750
uh sublist okay what's the time
complexity for this one

1296
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:25,760

 

1297
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,430
