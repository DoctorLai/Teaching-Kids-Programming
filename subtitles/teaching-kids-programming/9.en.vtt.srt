is called
 

13
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,750
is called
two summer

14
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760

 

15
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,830

right so let's say given a number a

16
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
right so let's say given a number a
 

17
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,390
right so let's say given a number a
list okay so this problem is like that

18
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
list okay so this problem is like that
 

19
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,189
list okay so this problem is like that
given a list

20
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:29,199
given a list
 

21
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,709
given a list
like two four

22
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
like two four
 

23
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,150
like two four
six three one

24
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
six three one
 

25
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,270
six three one
okay seven okay seven one so given

26
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
okay seven okay seven one so given
 

27
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,069
okay seven okay seven one so given
a list of numbers and a target so this

28
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
a list of numbers and a target so this
 

29
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,470
a list of numbers and a target so this
is the

30
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
is the
 

31
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,630
is the
numbers okay let's call it lumps

32
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640

 

33
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,670

lumps terrible writing anyway so then

34
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
lumps terrible writing anyway so then
 

35
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,590
lumps terrible writing anyway so then
there's a target

36
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
there's a target
 

37
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,830
there's a target
target and it's ten

38
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
target and it's ten
 

39
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,750
target and it's ten
no so yeah exactly so our target is to

40
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
no so yeah exactly so our target is to
 

41
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,149
no so yeah exactly so our target is to
check

42
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
check
 

43
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,630
check
if there are any two numbers any two

44
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
if there are any two numbers any two
 

45
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,190
if there are any two numbers any two
numbers

46
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
numbers
 

47
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,230
numbers
yeah in this given num

48
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
yeah in this given num
 

49
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,350
yeah in this given num
given list if they sum up to 10

50
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360

 

51
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,870

yeah if it's if it is you just return

52
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
yeah if it's if it is you just return
 

53
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,030
yeah if it's if it is you just return
true otherwise it returns four okay

54
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
true otherwise it returns four okay
 

55
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,870
true otherwise it returns four okay
that's a simple version so any thoughts

56
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
that's a simple version so any thoughts
 

57
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,070
that's a simple version so any thoughts
any thoughts how do we do it that

58
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
any thoughts how do we do it that
 

59
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,630
any thoughts how do we do it that
i know so can you explain to me how

60
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
i know so can you explain to me how
 

61
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,429
i know so can you explain to me how
would you

62
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
would you
 

63
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,350
would you
do this how would you check if now look

64
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
do this how would you check if now look
 

65
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,950
do this how would you check if now look
this is a simple one because

66
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
this is a simple one because
 

67
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,670
this is a simple one because
we got this four and six plus to ten

68
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
we got this four and six plus to ten
 

69
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,950
we got this four and six plus to ten
right

70
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
right
 

71
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,469
right
so how do we how do we uh so what's your

72
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
so how do we how do we uh so what's your
 

73
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,230
so how do we how do we uh so what's your
general approach to solve this kind of

74
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
general approach to solve this kind of
 

75
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,030
general approach to solve this kind of
problem

76
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040

 

77
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,789

ryan any thoughts

78
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799

 

79
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,230

so how do you know it's uh that

80
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
so how do you know it's uh that
 

81
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,469
so how do you know it's uh that
how do you know given a list of numbers

82
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
how do you know given a list of numbers
 

83
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,749
how do you know given a list of numbers
and a target

84
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
and a target
 

85
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,709
and a target
how do you tell computer to return true

86
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
how do you tell computer to return true
 

87
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,030
how do you tell computer to return true
or false

88
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
or false
 

89
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,670
or false
eric eric how do you how do you do it

90
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
eric eric how do you how do you do it
 

91
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,669
eric eric how do you how do you do it
you just look for the numbers

92
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
you just look for the numbers
 

93
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,869
you just look for the numbers
yeah how

94
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
yeah how
 

95
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,070
yeah how
or you try different i mean you

96
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
or you try different i mean you
 

97
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,589
or you try different i mean you
search you enumerate all pairs

98
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
search you enumerate all pairs
 

99
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,190
search you enumerate all pairs
and then to see if we sum up to the

100
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
and then to see if we sum up to the
 

101
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,589
and then to see if we sum up to the
topic that's one approach

102
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
topic that's one approach
 

103
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,110
topic that's one approach
yes okay can we can we do this

104
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
yes okay can we can we do this
 

105
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,190
yes okay can we can we do this
like that okay can we do this sit down

106
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200
like that okay can we do this sit down
 

107
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,470
like that okay can we do this sit down
otherwise

108
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
otherwise
 

109
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,390
otherwise
the audience will not see the whiteboard

110
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,400
the audience will not see the whiteboard
 

111
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:42,150
the audience will not see the whiteboard
please i can do this

112
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160

 

113
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,430

and there was a lungs

114
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
and there was a lungs
 

115
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,030
and there was a lungs
and there's a turkey let's just call it

116
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
and there's a turkey let's just call it
 

117
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,070
and there's a turkey let's just call it
tea okay yeah

118
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
tea okay yeah
 

119
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,150
tea okay yeah
so we can look we can iterate all the

120
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
so we can look we can iterate all the
 

121
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,350
so we can look we can iterate all the
numbers right

122
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
numbers right
 

123
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,550
numbers right
yes we need to say t equals target

124
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
yes we need to say t equals target
 

125
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,790
yes we need to say t equals target
that's okay we just protect t so we all

126
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
that's okay we just protect t so we all
 

127
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,589
that's okay we just protect t so we all
can do it

128
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
can do it
 

129
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,589
can do it
let's say we first get a length equals

130
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
let's say we first get a length equals
 

131
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,149
let's say we first get a length equals
equal uh let's call it uh maybe

132
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159

 

133
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,750

uh size equals land

134
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760

 

135
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,509

lung okay

136
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
lung okay
 

137
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,070
lung okay
so now we just need to check for four

138
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
so now we just need to check for four
 

139
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,790
so now we just need to check for four
right

140
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
right
 

141
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,710
right
that's one solution for i in

142
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
that's one solution for i in
 

143
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,750
that's one solution for i in
range

144
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760

 

145
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,949

what range s z

146
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
what range s z
 

147
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,990
what range s z
and then we we iterate here

148
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
and then we we iterate here
 

149
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,350
and then we we iterate here
and then we iterate another one it was j

150
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
and then we iterate another one it was j
 

151
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,229
and then we iterate another one it was j
in range but now we start from

152
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239

 

153
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,990

start from zero to i j another variable

154
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
start from zero to i j another variable
 

155
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,509
start from zero to i j another variable
so so i'll

156
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
so so i'll
 

157
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,990
so so i'll
teach you about that later so now we got

158
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
teach you about that later so now we got
 

159
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,789
teach you about that later so now we got
it so

160
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
it so
 

161
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,990
it so
basically let me

162
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
basically let me
 

163
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,509
basically let me
where's the red pen okay let's try

164
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
where's the red pen okay let's try
 

165
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,949
where's the red pen okay let's try
so here we've got the i yes

166
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
so here we've got the i yes
 

167
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,070
so here we've got the i yes
i will be pointing to the first

168
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
i will be pointing to the first
 

169
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,509
i will be pointing to the first
second third fourth and fifth and j

170
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
second third fourth and fifth and j
 

171
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,429
second third fourth and fifth and j
we're pointing to the star and

172
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
we're pointing to the star and
 

173
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,469
we're pointing to the star and
until but not equal to i okay so now

174
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
until but not equal to i okay so now
 

175
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,670
until but not equal to i okay so now
what happened

176
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
what happened
 

177
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,270
what happened
is i got the numbers i and number three

178
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
is i got the numbers i and number three
 

179
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,469
is i got the numbers i and number three
so if

180
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
so if
 

181
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,670
so if
that's the interesting part

182
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680

 

183
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,990

num i plus

184
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
num i plus
 

185
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,749
num i plus
num z equals

186
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
num z equals
 

187
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,510
num z equals
t what do we do so we found a pair

188
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
t what do we do so we found a pair
 

189
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,070
t what do we do so we found a pair
i and j right because if i is here then

190
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
i and j right because if i is here then
 

191
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,950
i and j right because if i is here then
j is here

192
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
j is here
 

193
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,990
j is here
i is is here and j

194
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
i is is here and j
 

195
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,590
i is is here and j
is here so numbers i plus num z

196
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
is here so numbers i plus num z
 

197
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,189
is here so numbers i plus num z
equals what the target right now

198
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
equals what the target right now
 

199
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,870
equals what the target right now
what's with return return

200
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
what's with return return
 

201
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,469
what's with return return
we are written true or false right

202
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
we are written true or false right
 

203
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,189
we are written true or false right
return true allies return first

204
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199

 

205
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,790

do you get it ryan

206
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
do you get it ryan
 

207
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,350
do you get it ryan
do you get it ryan yes

208
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
do you get it ryan yes
 

209
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,870
do you get it ryan yes
sit down please right

210
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880

 

211
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,909

okay so anyway

212
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
okay so anyway
 

213
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,510
okay so anyway
yeah yeah yeah look look this one okay

214
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
yeah yeah yeah look look this one okay
 

215
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,150
yeah yeah yeah look look this one okay
let's do this let's in let's go through

216
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
let's do this let's in let's go through
 

217
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,670
let's do this let's in let's go through
this example

218
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680

 

219
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,990

look s z equals nine which is one two

220
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
look s z equals nine which is one two
 

221
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,550
look s z equals nine which is one two
three four

222
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
three four
 

223
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,430
three four
five so sc will be equals to five right

224
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
five so sc will be equals to five right
 

225
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,150
five so sc will be equals to five right
right

226
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
right
 

227
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,670
right
right listen yeah awake listen please

228
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
right listen yeah awake listen please
 

229
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,950
right listen yeah awake listen please
look sc will be five right

230
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
look sc will be five right
 

231
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,830
look sc will be five right
sc will be five because the length is

232
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
sc will be five because the length is
 

233
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,550
sc will be five because the length is
five

234
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
five
 

235
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,590
five
there are five elements so for i in

236
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
there are five elements so for i in
 

237
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,070
there are five elements so for i in
range sg so what will happen

238
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
range sg so what will happen
 

239
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,990
range sg so what will happen
so i will become the value of 0

240
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
so i will become the value of 0
 

241
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,590
so i will become the value of 0
1 2 3 and 4. i'm right

242
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
1 2 3 and 4. i'm right
 

243
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,710
1 2 3 and 4. i'm right
yeah for z equals range i will happen

244
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
yeah for z equals range i will happen
 

245
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,029
yeah for z equals range i will happen
when i is 0 then j will be nothing right

246
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
when i is 0 then j will be nothing right
 

247
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,950
when i is 0 then j will be nothing right
when i is one j will be what

248
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
when i is one j will be what
 

249
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,990
when i is one j will be what
the range range one then

250
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
the range range one then
 

251
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,110
the range range one then
left j will be what zero so

252
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
left j will be what zero so
 

253
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,150
left j will be what zero so
what does that mean means that the i

254
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
what does that mean means that the i
 

255
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,870
what does that mean means that the i
what okay so i this i pointer will point

256
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
what okay so i this i pointer will point
 

257
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,189
what okay so i this i pointer will point
to

258
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
to
 

259
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,990
to
this this list this list okay when i is

260
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
this this list this list okay when i is
 

261
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,790
this this list this list okay when i is
pointing to

262
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
pointing to
 

263
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,830
pointing to
6 then j we're pointing from 2

264
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
6 then j we're pointing from 2
 

265
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,350
6 then j we're pointing from 2
4 yeah so the left side of i right

266
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
4 yeah so the left side of i right
 

267
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,510
4 yeah so the left side of i right
when i is pointing seven j will be

268
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
when i is pointing seven j will be
 

269
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,710
when i is pointing seven j will be
pointing to two four

270
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
pointing to two four
 

271
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,670
pointing to two four
six and one i is pointing to one j will

272
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
six and one i is pointing to one j will
 

273
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,390
six and one i is pointing to one j will
be pointing

274
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
be pointing
 

275
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,590
be pointing
two four six seven do you get it yes

276
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
two four six seven do you get it yes
 

277
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,430
two four six seven do you get it yes
and then every time we have two two

278
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
and then every time we have two two
 

279
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,350
and then every time we have two two
pointers then we just check

280
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
pointers then we just check
 

281
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,469
pointers then we just check
if these two numbers added up to the

282
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
if these two numbers added up to the
 

283
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,189
if these two numbers added up to the
target if it is we return true right

284
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
target if it is we return true right
 

285
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,070
target if it is we return true right
immediately otherwise after these two

286
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
immediately otherwise after these two
 

287
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,870
immediately otherwise after these two
loop

288
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
loop
 

289
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,710
loop
if we can't find any number then we

290
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
if we can't find any number then we
 

291
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,550
if we can't find any number then we
return first

292
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
return first
 

293
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,909
return first
got it yeah so ho

294
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
got it yeah so ho
 

295
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,990
got it yeah so ho
so you see if this i is five

296
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
so you see if this i is five
 

297
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,710
so you see if this i is five
and uh if the number is there there are

298
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
and uh if the number is there there are
 

299
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,950
and uh if the number is there there are
five elements and how many times the

300
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
five elements and how many times the
 

301
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,070
five elements and how many times the
computer needs to check

302
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
computer needs to check
 

303
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,870
computer needs to check
five now when we look at this is one

304
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
five now when we look at this is one
 

305
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,350
five now when we look at this is one
time

306
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
time
 

307
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,870
time
this is two times and then

308
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
this is two times and then
 

309
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,550
this is two times and then
two so that would be that's okay that's

310
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
two so that would be that's okay that's
 

311
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,189
two so that would be that's okay that's
okay

312
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
okay
 

313
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,309
okay
so that will be around five

314
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
so that will be around five
 

315
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,270
so that will be around five
times five divided by two approximately

316
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
times five divided by two approximately
 

317
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,909
times five divided by two approximately
all right

318
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
all right
 

319
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,629
all right
right yes because one eye is pointing

320
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
right yes because one eye is pointing
 

321
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,469
right yes because one eye is pointing
here and then it needs to check one two

322
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
here and then it needs to check one two
 

323
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,670
here and then it needs to check one two
three four

324
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
three four
 

325
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,110
three four
yeah twenty times yes and it must be yes

326
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
yeah twenty times yes and it must be yes
 

327
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,990
yeah twenty times yes and it must be yes
12 yeah something like that so you can

328
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
12 yeah something like that so you can
 

329
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,270
12 yeah something like that so you can
imagine when this n

330
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
imagine when this n
 

331
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,830
imagine when this n
goes to very large it needs to be

332
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
goes to very large it needs to be
 

333
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,790
goes to very large it needs to be
approximately

334
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
approximately
 

335
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,710
approximately
a square n square divided by 2 right

336
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
a square n square divided by 2 right
 

337
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,110
a square n square divided by 2 right
because

338
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
because
 

339
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,629
because
it's when i is somewhere

340
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
it's when i is somewhere
 

341
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,830
it's when i is somewhere
it only goes to half of this eye okay so

342
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
it only goes to half of this eye okay so
 

343
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,749
it only goes to half of this eye okay so
it's not very efficient so how can we

344
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
it's not very efficient so how can we
 

345
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,909
it's not very efficient so how can we
improve it

346
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
improve it
 

347
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,029
improve it
how can we improve it this is one method

348
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
how can we improve it this is one method
 

349
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:09,670
how can we improve it this is one method
okay

350
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
okay
 

351
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,430
okay
so how about we use a

352
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
so how about we use a
 

353
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,189
so how about we use a
dictionary do you remember this

354
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
dictionary do you remember this
 

355
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,110
dictionary do you remember this
dictionary

356
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
dictionary
 

357
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,390
dictionary
okay yeah this

358
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
okay yeah this
 

359
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,950
okay yeah this
what do we call it curly brace yeah a

360
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
what do we call it curly brace yeah a
 

361
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,029
what do we call it curly brace yeah a
notebook oh remember the notebook

362
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
notebook oh remember the notebook
 

363
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,230
notebook oh remember the notebook

yeah yeah so
the uh the idea is we we go through once

366
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
the uh the idea is we we go through once
 

367
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,389
the uh the idea is we we go through once
alright look we go through these numbers

368
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
alright look we go through these numbers
 

369
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,230
alright look we go through these numbers
and then we put it in the notebook right

370
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
and then we put it in the notebook right
 

371
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,909
and then we put it in the notebook right
yeah yes and once we find it

372
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
yeah yes and once we find it
 

373
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,110
yeah yes and once we find it
if the target minus current number is in

374
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
if the target minus current number is in
 

375
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,389
if the target minus current number is in
the notebook so what happened

376
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
the notebook so what happened
 

377

maybe just just like that okay so look
the first number we're going

390
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
the first number we're going
 

391
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,670
the first number we're going
visiting the number first number is two

so how do we do it

502
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480

 

503
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,230

notebook oh in in fact you you can also

504
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
notebook oh in in fact you you can also
 

505
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,630
notebook oh in in fact you you can also
use

506
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
use
 

507
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,470
use
using the set remember we talked about

508
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
using the set remember we talked about
 

509
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,670
using the set remember we talked about
the set before

510
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
the set before
 

511
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,990
the set before
yes okay but it's quite similar okay so

512
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
yes okay but it's quite similar okay so
 

513
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,710
yes okay but it's quite similar okay so
notebook

514
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
notebook
 

515
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,990
notebook
goal is for i in

516
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
goal is for i in
 

517
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,190
goal is for i in
nums so what do we do look

518
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
nums so what do we do look
 

519
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,790
nums so what do we do look
if if

520
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
if if
 

521
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,310
if if
look if the target if target

522
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
look if the target if target
 

523
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,430
look if the target if target
minus minus

524
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
minus minus
 

525
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,949
minus minus
i is in the notebook right is a notebook

526
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
i is in the notebook right is a notebook
 

527
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,509
i is in the notebook right is a notebook
then we will have two right

528
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519

 

529
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,430

ah then we need to do what we need to

530
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
ah then we need to do what we need to
 

531
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,509
ah then we need to do what we need to
put a notebook

532
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
put a notebook
 

533
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,190
put a notebook
we need to put i in the notebook how do

534
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
we need to put i in the notebook how do
 

535
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,870
we need to put i in the notebook how do
we do it notebook

536
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
we do it notebook
 

537
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,269
we do it notebook
i equals true right we just do it true

538
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
i equals true right we just do it true
 

539
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,750
i equals true right we just do it true
and then here we'll return first is it

540
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
and then here we'll return first is it
 

541
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,710
and then here we'll return first is it
simple

542
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
simple
 

543
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,990
simple
we're only using one four right i like

544
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
we're only using one four right i like
 

545
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,470
we're only using one four right i like
to

546
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
to
 

547
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,670
to
get it do you get it

548
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
get it do you get it
 

549
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,389
get it do you get it
are you sure okay so using the set is

550
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
are you sure okay so using the set is
 

551
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:10,870
are you sure okay so using the set is
quite

552
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
quite
 

553
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,829
quite
similar it's quite similar so we can

554
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
similar it's quite similar so we can
 

555
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,670
similar it's quite similar so we can
replace this with

556
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
replace this with
 

557
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,509
replace this with
with what we set we set

558
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
with what we set we set
 

559
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,230
with what we set we set
and then this is the same and these this

560
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
and then this is the same and these this
 

561
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,030
and then this is the same and these this
will be

562
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
will be
 

563
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,750
will be
we can do this notebook dot add

564
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
we can do this notebook dot add
 

565
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,990
we can do this notebook dot add
add one add one add what

566
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
add one add one add what
 

567
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,150
add one add one add what
set now add the number i yeah

568
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
set now add the number i yeah
 

569
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,750
set now add the number i yeah
okay and then this is return force right

570
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
okay and then this is return force right
 

571
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,230
okay and then this is return force right
you get it can we have a better solution

572
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
you get it can we have a better solution
 

573
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,710
you get it can we have a better solution
can we have a better solution

574
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720

 

575
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,870

okay we can have another one look we can

576
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
okay we can have another one look we can
 

577
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,790
okay we can have another one look we can
i can teach you right

578
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
i can teach you right
 

579
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,470
i can teach you right
look this is another way yeah how about

580
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
look this is another way yeah how about
 

581
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,990
look this is another way yeah how about
how about how about look we saw this

582
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,000
how about how about look we saw this
 

583
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,870
how about how about look we saw this
number remember how do we sort it

584
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
number remember how do we sort it
 

585
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,590
number remember how do we sort it
so they make the numbers in order right

586
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:09,600
so they make the numbers in order right
 

587
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,629
so they make the numbers in order right
so in python we can use this

588
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
so in python we can use this
 

589
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,310
so in python we can use this
we can use lambs alright

590
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
we can use lambs alright
 

591
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,430
we can use lambs alright
when dot salt

592
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
when dot salt
 

593
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,590
when dot salt
okay that's it simple is that number

594
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
okay that's it simple is that number
 

595
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,990
okay that's it simple is that number
stop soft so leaf becomes

596
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000
stop soft so leaf becomes
 

597
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,190
stop soft so leaf becomes
one two four six

598
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
one two four six
 

599
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,030
one two four six
seven all right eric

600
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
seven all right eric
 

601
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,150
seven all right eric
so when these two is sorting

602
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
so when these two is sorting
 

603
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,550
so when these two is sorting
then these numbers will become in order

604
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
then these numbers will become in order
 

605
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,509
then these numbers will become in order
yes

606
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
yes
 

607
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,230
yes
will become another when you do this all

608
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
will become another when you do this all
 

609
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,790
will become another when you do this all
right

610
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
right
 

611
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,910
right
right when you do this thought these

612
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
right when you do this thought these
 

613
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,150
right when you do this thought these
numbers will become in order

614
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
numbers will become in order
 

615
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,430
numbers will become in order
i would listen write a listener please

616
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
i would listen write a listener please
 

617
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,310
i would listen write a listener please
okay how about if i want to in the

618
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
okay how about if i want to in the
 

619
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,310
okay how about if i want to in the
reverse order

620
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320

 

621
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,189

anyways why how we can do this we can

622
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
anyways why how we can do this we can
 

623
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,670
anyways why how we can do this we can
launch the sort and passing a key

624
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
launch the sort and passing a key
 

625
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,710
launch the sort and passing a key
called the reverse and

626
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
called the reverse and
 

627
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,230
called the reverse and
reverse equals true okay

628
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
reverse equals true okay
 

629
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,030
reverse equals true okay
reverse equals true and then it will be

630
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
reverse equals true and then it will be
 

631
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,110
reverse equals true and then it will be
in the reverse order okay

632
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120
in the reverse order okay
 

633
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,150
in the reverse order okay
hey wait listen carefully please i'm

634
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
hey wait listen carefully please i'm
 

635

test you later okay i just
 

639
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,110
test you later okay i just
looked down for like a second oh okay

640
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
looked down for like a second oh okay
 

641
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,790
looked down for like a second oh okay
and you haven't even thought anything

642
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800

 

643
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,710

yeah so so

644
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720

 

645
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,430

so look so now these numbers in order

646
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
so look so now these numbers in order
 

647
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,269
so look so now these numbers in order
that's a very interesting part and our

648
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
that's a very interesting part and our
 

649
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,030
that's a very interesting part and our
target is 10 right we are looking for

650
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,040
target is 10 right we are looking for
 

651
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,750
target is 10 right we are looking for
these 10

652
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
these 10
 

653
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,990
these 10
yeah these numbers in order so how do we

654
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
yeah these numbers in order so how do we
 

655
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,110
yeah these numbers in order so how do we
do it we have the left we point into the

656
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
do it we have the left we point into the
 

657
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,990
do it we have the left we point into the
to the smallest and we have a right we

658
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
to the smallest and we have a right we
 

659
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,430
to the smallest and we have a right we
point into the biggest

660
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
point into the biggest
 

661
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,829
point into the biggest
doesn't have to be involved yes that's

662
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:55,839
doesn't have to be involved yes that's
 

663
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,949
doesn't have to be involved yes that's
why i have i have sorted look the soft

664
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
why i have i have sorted look the soft
 

665
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,030
why i have i have sorted look the soft
yeah you don't need to be reverse then

666
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
yeah you don't need to be reverse then
 

667
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,629
yeah you don't need to be reverse then
will become the from largest to the

668
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
will become the from largest to the
 

669
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,470
will become the from largest to the
to the smallest so long story so

670
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
to the smallest so long story so
 

671
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,829
to the smallest so long story so
you would make the numbers array numbers

672
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839
you would make the numbers array numbers
 

673
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,269
you would make the numbers array numbers
in order which is from the smallest to

674
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
in order which is from the smallest to
 

675
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,870
in order which is from the smallest to
the biggest

676
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
the biggest
 

677
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,310
the biggest
so now we left pointing to the smallest

678
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
so now we left pointing to the smallest
 

679
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,509
so now we left pointing to the smallest
number

680
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
number
 

681
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,990
number
right pointing to the biggest number

682
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
right pointing to the biggest number
 

683
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,350
right pointing to the biggest number
what's the

684
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
what's the
 

685
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,670
what's the
what's the sum of the numbers pointing

686
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
what's the sum of the numbers pointing
 

687
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,470
what's the sum of the numbers pointing
at

688
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
at
 

689
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,150
at
both eight we're done so if a smaller

690
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
both eight we're done so if a smaller
 

691
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,030
both eight we're done so if a smaller
than ten

692
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
than ten
 

693
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,230
than ten
yeah yes smaller than ten okay we're

694
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
yeah yes smaller than ten okay we're
 

695
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,030
yeah yes smaller than ten okay we're
looking for the

696
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
looking for the
 

697
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,509
looking for the
any two numbers adding up to ten so so

698
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
any two numbers adding up to ten so so
 

699
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,230
any two numbers adding up to ten so so
tell me

700

tell me
 

701
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,470
tell me
should i move the left to the right or

702
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
should i move the left to the right or
 

703

00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
the right to the left
 

705
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,430
the right to the left
the left to the right why is that

706
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440

 

707
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,269

why is that because we why is that

connected yeah
 

711
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,389
connected yeah
we need to move to the left to the right

712
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
we need to move to the left to the right
 

713
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,230
we need to move to the left to the right
why

714
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
why
 

715
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,430
why
because we need to make it bigger

716
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:58,440
because we need to make it bigger

the right side only the left left
moving to the right will become bigger

722
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759
moving to the right will become bigger
 

723
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,670
moving to the right will become bigger
right so yeah that's

724
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
right so yeah that's

ryan do you get it yeah okay so now

728
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
ryan do you get it yeah okay so now
 

729
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,870
ryan do you get it yeah okay so now
we're moving to the

730
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
we're moving to the
 

731
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,629
we're moving to the
right so now what's the sum nine

732
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
right so now what's the sum nine
 

733
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,670
right so now what's the sum nine
nine is nine smaller than ten yeah so

734
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
nine is nine smaller than ten yeah so
 

735
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,430
nine is nine smaller than ten yeah so
what do we do

736
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
what do we do
 

737
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,629
what do we do
maybe move it again right so

738
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
maybe move it again right so
 

739
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,829
maybe move it again right so
fourth plus seven eleven eleven bigger

740
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
fourth plus seven eleven eleven bigger
 

741
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,970
fourth plus seven eleven eleven bigger
than ten so what do we do

742
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:31,980
than ten so what do we do
 

743
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,069
than ten so what do we do
[Music]

744
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
[Music]
 

745
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,550
[Music]
yeah because because you you can move to

746
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
yeah because because you you can move to
 

747
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,790
yeah because because you you can move to
the right because it moves to the right

748
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
the right because it moves to the right
 

749
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,790
the right because it moves to the right
then the sum will become bigger right we

750
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
then the sum will become bigger right we
 

751
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,710
then the sum will become bigger right we
want to reduce it

752
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
want to reduce it
 

753
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,629
want to reduce it
yeah so yeah and now four plus six

754
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
yeah so yeah and now four plus six
 

755
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,470
yeah so yeah and now four plus six
ten yeah we got it we found the answer

756
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
ten yeah we got it we found the answer
 

757
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,030
ten yeah we got it we found the answer
yeah so now return true

758
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
yeah so now return true
 

759
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,670
yeah so now return true
okay so how do we do it look i

760
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
okay so how do we do it look i
 

761
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,310
okay so how do we do it look i
actually look if you say if you look you

762
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
actually look if you say if you look you
 

763
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,910
actually look if you say if you look you
can write to

764
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
can write to
 

765
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,230
can write to
if i equal zero okay say equals

766
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
if i equal zero okay say equals
 

767
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,270
if i equal zero okay say equals
length lambda

768
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
length lambda
 

769
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,750
length lambda
minus 1 then you can write it in one

770
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:09,760
minus 1 then you can write it in one
 

771
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,390
minus 1 then you can write it in one
line yeah

772
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
line yeah
 

773
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,750
line yeah
i i j equals zero

774
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
i i j equals zero
 

775
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,350
i i j equals zero
length lungs okay numbs minus one

776
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
length lungs okay numbs minus one
 

777
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,110
length lungs okay numbs minus one
and what do we do why why they are no

778
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
and what do we do why why they are no
 

779
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,270
and what do we do why why they are no
meeting in the middle right

780
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
meeting in the middle right
 

781
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,750
meeting in the middle right
why the i and j no meeting in the middle

782
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
why the i and j no meeting in the middle
 

783
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,549
why the i and j no meeting in the middle
right

784
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
right
 

785
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,830
right
yes if glams

786
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840

 

787
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,070

i plus num j

788
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,080

 

789
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,750

is is target then we return to right

790
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
is is target then we return to right
 

791
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,430
is is target then we return to right
yeah we found the target yeah am i

792
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
yeah we found the target yeah am i
 

793
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,950
yeah we found the target yeah am i
yes then okay so now i write it this way

794
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
yes then okay so now i write it this way
 

795
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,350
yes then okay so now i write it this way
choose more space here come come here

796
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
choose more space here come come here
 

797

okay
 

799
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,350
okay
then we need to check again if

800
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
then we need to check again if
 

801
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,390
then we need to check again if
nam

802
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400

 

803
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,150

i plus num j if it's bigger than 10 what

804
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
i plus num j if it's bigger than 10 what
 

805
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,430
i plus num j if it's bigger than 10 what
do we do

806
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,440
do we do
 

807
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,820
do we do
what do we do here you will say right

808
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:05,830
what do we do here you will say right
 

809
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,150
what do we do here you will say right

[Music]
write me to the left so right minus

812
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
write me to the left so right minus
 

813
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,549
write me to the left so right minus
equals one right it means decrement yeah

814
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:14,559
equals one right it means decrement yeah
 

815
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,590
equals one right it means decrement yeah
and ask what should we do

816
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600

are the only thing first
 

827
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,909
are the only thing first
so do you get it which way which one you

828
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
so do you get it which way which one you
 

829
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,669
so do you get it which way which one you
do you like the best

830
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
do you like the best
 

831
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,549
do you like the best
the shortest one the shortest one okay

832
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
the shortest one the shortest one okay
 

833
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,310
the shortest one the shortest one okay
how about you implement one approach

834
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
how about you implement one approach
 

835
