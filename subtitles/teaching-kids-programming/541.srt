1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:08,040
okay so we have uh different ways of

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,740
cutting a circle like if you can imagine

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,040
that's a pizza right these are the two

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,480
Valley cards so you can cut directly

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,539
through into that diameter okay

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,900
or you can do this half cut one touches

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,279
the edge of the pizza and the other one

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,099
touches the center of the pizza at least

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,080
it's not a very cut right so the

10
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,239
question is that we want to cut this

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,360
piece up this circle into an equal

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,940
slices equal slices right you can do it

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,579
this way cut into two half or you can do

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,160
this half cut right but this is not

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,920
cutting into two slices this is just two

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,980
half cup okay so the question is that we

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,219
want to do the minimum cut that cut into

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,079
the N slices equal slices all right so

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,440
for example yeah as you can see we draw

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,980
here right if n equals the one so we do

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,519
zero card right and n equals 1 so that

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,500
means zero cut right n equals two

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,500
okay this is n equals two you do this

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,500
one cut right into two so n equals two

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,820
we need to do one cut and equal three

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,460
yeah you do this yeah because it depends

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,200
n equals three so you do

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,140
three

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,780
half cut so that's three

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,080
all right n equals four which one is

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:36,140
that initial for this one yeah this one

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,140
so two four cuts

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,159
n equals five which one is that equals

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,759
five which one

35
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,640
two three four five okay

36
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,119
I equals six

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,299
this one so how many cards of this

38
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,939
okay right three three okay and then

39
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,579
equals seven

40
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,299
I'm gonna cut

41
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,299
seven seven

42
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,500
yeah do you see the strategy

43
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:15,000
so what's the strategies you can use it

44
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,400
is that from one is that from one yeah

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,680
it's kind of different to the other side

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,180
yeah special cases this is the even

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,879
number you can it's Heaven yeah and and

48
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,319
if it's the old number it's just that's

49
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,599
right yes you are right very good

50
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,700
observation so if it's a look if n

51
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:38,040
equals six n equals six so it will be

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:41,459
so we can do this uh half right so n

53
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,819
equals six is this this way right yeah

54
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:47,280
so look look at this half

55
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,739
so that's three three slices

56
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,440
but with the three slices look we can

57
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,500
extend this to that so it's it just

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,379
requires half of it all right yeah we

59
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,920
cut half on a circle half our pizza into

60
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,319
slide uh three slices just you know this

61
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,420
this is three slices but we can map it

62
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,760
so and honestly it's like this so if

63
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,400
this is n equals six right so it's even

64
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,500
number we can uh half and it half and

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,500
half a cut

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,459
right but if it's a odd number how would

67
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,580
you do it

68
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,980
you just do this on one server right to

69
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,300
130 just equally

70
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,099
equally space right okay and n equals

71
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:35,700
one is a special case

72
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:41,099
so be fine uh F if n if n equals one

73
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:45,239
return zero special case if n is odd

74
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:50,180
right n one or modulus two if n n one or

75
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:53,519
if if n modulus 2 equal equal one

76
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:57,540
land three ten and right if it's all

77
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,360
number written n otherwise return and

78
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,820
divide divide divided by two heavily

79
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,319
okay common space complexity

80
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,200
[Music]

81
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,180
exactly look just mess space or one

82
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,939
right okay so what have you learned

83
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,040
today about cut okay so if you want to

84
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:20,519
describe this to Mommy or how would you

85
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,880
say come on we have a cool Pizza yeah

86
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,400
you have a pizza that we need to eat

87
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,979
and we need to cut it

88
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,740
and

89
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:36,120
try the minimum equal slices yeah yeah

90
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,940
so what's the strategy we just

91
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,320
we just have any even numbers

92
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,259
uh to the minimum and then the other

93
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,800
okay

94
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:54,960
so we have a circle and we we only can

95
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,740
do the cuts of of straight through or or

96
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,100
a half cup

97
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:06,720
a a half car and so so if you want to

98
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:10,199
cut it into n equal slices and so it's

99
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,460
just like a pizza and the strategy is

100
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:18,120
if it's an even number you can just it's

101
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,320
haha because because you can you can do

102
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,419
two

103
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:27,780
two hot two half cuts which makes one

104
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:31,919
just like two half Cuts makes one street

105
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:36,300
Cuts so it has and and the odd number is

106
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:40,139
just it but but the N equals one is

107
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,539
special as as you can see here oh so you

108
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,880
don't need to zero but

109
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:49,460
well that's good that's it for today

110
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,460
bye-bye bye bye bye
