from zero zero one
 

87
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,030
from zero zero one
okay and the second

88
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040

 

89
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,589

second element of the tuple will be the
 

91
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,470
second element of the tuple will be the
value so it's

92
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
value so it's
 

93
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,510

exactly like it's exactly like what
 

95
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,110

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,589
i in what range with
a range and then what are we looking for

100
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
a range and then what are we looking for
 

101
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,390
a range and then what are we looking for
lens lens s

102

109
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,390
i okay so it's the same thing you see
these two is the same thing okay so

110
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
these two is the same thing okay so
 

111
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,670
these two is the same thing okay so
which one you like

112
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
which one you like
 

113
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,030
which one you like
better this is

114
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
better this is
 

115
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,390
better this is
this this is the second one okay

116
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
this this is the second one okay
 

117
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,430
this this is the second one okay
so second approach i don't know okay so

118
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
so second approach i don't know okay so
 

119
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,430
so second approach i don't know okay so
this function is basically to it so how

120
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
this function is basically to it so how
 

121
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,309
this function is basically to it so how
can we implement this in numerator

125
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,110
look it's i it's almost here yeah so how
how can we write it

i let's say for a b
 

197
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,590
i let's say for a b
uh i i think it's the same

198
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
uh i i think it's the same
 

199
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,710
uh i i think it's the same
double that speech mark wait i

200
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
double that speech mark wait i
 

201
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,749
double that speech mark wait i
i forgot the c

202
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
i forgot the c
 

203
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:59,189

205
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,150

and then point a b so guess what's the

206
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
and then point a b so guess what's the
 

207
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,950
and then point a b so guess what's the
output

208
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
output
 

209
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,550
output

hello let's do let's
 

245
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,390
hello let's do let's
let's divide it uh

246
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400

 

247
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,589

yeah let's do this uh

248
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
yeah let's do this uh
 

249
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,950
yeah let's do this uh
uh let's do this blue my

250
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
uh let's do this blue my
 

251
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,749
uh let's do this blue my
enumerate okay and as you tell me what

252
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
enumerate okay and as you tell me what
 

253
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,790
enumerate okay and as you tell me what
to write are there four

254
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
to write are there four
 

255
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,589
to write are there four
i in range

256
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599

 

257
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,629

length s one and

258
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
length s one and
 

259
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,150
length s one and
one what's here the word style is

260
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
one what's here the word style is
 

261
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,570
one what's here the word style is
y u

262
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:33,580

 

263
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,830

[Music]

264
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
[Music]
 

265
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,909
[Music]
and then you can use it as this you can

266
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
and then you can use it as this you can
 

267
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,990
and then you can use it as this you can
say for i i

268
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
say for i i
 

269
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,350
say for i i
in my initial life okay

270
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
in my initial life okay
 

271
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,469
in my initial life okay
s and then you print i

272
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
s and then you print i
 

273
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,350
s and then you print i
asi so it's the same thing yeah can you

274
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
asi so it's the same thing yeah can you
 

275
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,510
asi so it's the same thing yeah can you
can you be good boy please

276
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520

 

277
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,950

the string index must be integer

278
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
the string index must be integer
 

279
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,309
the string index must be integer
so that's a problem a problem

280
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
so that's a problem a problem
 

281
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,070
so that's a problem a problem
i think i'm going to make a point to our

282
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
i think i'm going to make a point to our
 

283
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,790
i think i'm going to make a point to our
plane so what's the problem here uh

284
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
plane so what's the problem here uh
 

285
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,550
plane so what's the problem here uh
okay for enumerate let me try

286
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
okay for enumerate let me try
 

287
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,469
okay for enumerate let me try
look look i here will be i

288
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
look look i here will be i
 

289
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,670
look look i here will be i
s i a okay so here will be

290
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
s i a okay so here will be
 

291
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,830
s i a okay so here will be
i there's a problem

292
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840

 

293
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,230

okay let's see

294
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240

 

295
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,469

too much is too much uh extra brackets

296
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
too much is too much uh extra brackets
 

297
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,309
too much is too much uh extra brackets
here

298
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
here
 

299
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,509
here
did you know that sometimes there's a

300
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
did you know that sometimes there's a
 

301
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,269
did you know that sometimes there's a
mistake okay that's okay but let's

302
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
mistake okay that's okay but let's
 

303
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,949
mistake okay that's okay but let's
we call it the box okay so now

304
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
we call it the box okay so now
 

305
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,550
we call it the box okay so now
everything is the same

306
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
everything is the same
 

307
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,949
everything is the same
you see every four to six is the same as

308
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
you see every four to six is the same as
 

309
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,070
you see every four to six is the same as
a to nine okay and then this is how we

310
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
a to nine okay and then this is how we
 

311
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,949
a to nine okay and then this is how we
implement the enumerate function in the

312
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
implement the enumerate function in the
 

313
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:49,430
implement the enumerate function in the
front

314
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
front
 

315
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,110
front
in the line number five okay so

316
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
in the line number five okay so
 

317
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,710
in the line number five okay so
basically the same thing

318
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
basically the same thing
 

319
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,949
basically the same thing
