1
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:06,000
all right

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,680
okay so last lesson we talked about this

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,860
uh problem all right we're given an

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,300
integer and we want to split it into two

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:15,059
integers obviously this is the

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,580
non-negative integers and both integers

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,740
can have these leading zeros I'm going

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,820
to find out a minimum sum right and the

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:27,359
strategy we taken is creative right so

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,880
we saw the digits and then we try to

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,740
pick the digit from a smaller one to the

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,960
bigger one all right because we want to

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,840
leave the larger digit to the right hand

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,760
side right yeah okay so look this is a

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,260
strategy we sort of the digit yeah we

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,960
convert it obviously we converted the

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,600
integer to the string we break it down

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,100
into an array of the digit characters

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,320
and we solved it this is a sorted array

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,559
and then we use the list complications

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,480
to pick every other digit the first

22
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,520
number we start picking every other

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,199
digit from the first digit the second

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,000
number we start picking every other

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,000
digit from the second digit so you will

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,240
pick the second the fourth the sixth

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,960
right and Etc when we pick the digit is

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,580
a list We join it to a string and now we

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,960
need to convert it back to the integer

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,659
and then we add it up right the Time

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,240
come back stays oh and again if n is the

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,400
number of digits okay the key thing here

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,140
is that we sort it right we have done

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,600
quite a few sorting again right and

35
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,820
quick saw the merge so much bubble

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,100
sorting selection so insertions over and

37
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,479
we also mentioned about the Pakistan we

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,340
saw about using bucket

39
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,560
bucket that's right basically like a

40
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,020
package each packet is a counter to

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,360
count the number of digits right given

42
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,200
this you know in decimal how many

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,479
different types of digits we have

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,460
yes 10 from zero to nine right you know

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,140
any number can be represented by at

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,939
least 10 digits right so we can just

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,340
count right for example we can count

48
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,979
using these buckets so how do we call

49
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,200
these in a bucket look so just imagine

50
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,399
how many packages created at the

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,500
beginning okay

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,600
yeah so 10 packets right each bucket for

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,300
each digit right so look I pack it right

54
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,039
I'm just going to draw a simple version

55
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,039
of it okay

56
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,039
right

57
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,080
here one two three four five six seven

58
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,239
eight nine ten eleven okay so this is

59
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,239
yellow one

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,239
okay

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,340
okay so Etc okay so let's consider this

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,660
number two three uh one four four seven

63
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,760
okay

64
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,160
this number

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,800
so two

66
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,300
two first introduce the second bucket

67
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,300
all right zero one two so the third

68
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:54,780
bucket so this is one here

69
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:56,879
three one one here four here four okay

70
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,959
another four so we increment this

71
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,540
counter

72
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:04,019
seven

73
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,360
yeah okay bye so now we have ten buckets

74
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,420
each bucket has is a counter

75
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,000
right so okay so just imagine okay now

76
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,700
and all the rest is zero how do you

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,379
construct this S1 s two two numbers

78
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,300
okay you could do it

79
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,640
all right we just go through these

80
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,760
digits and then we uh

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,280
count how many times they appear right

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,019
yeah make sense

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,060
okay so how do we construct these

84
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,159
stitches so obviously we need to check

85
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,900
from left to the right right the left is

86
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,680
zero this is the smallest number right

87
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,620
look here F1 S2

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,700
now I have one zeros here so where does

89
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,760
it go

90
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,299
here right yeah

91
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,879
see hello nothing one where is Jessica I

92
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,920
have one two two for tip digital I have

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,840
one where does it go

94
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,879
yeah all right

95
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,379
and move next where does it go let's

96
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,299
wait

97
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,940
yeah

98
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,940
okay move next four I have two

99
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:13,860
okay four yeah right because I have two

100
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:15,060
zero zero zero now like seven please you

101
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,979
all right

102
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,699
okay so the minimum

103
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:22,460
what what is it why is there two in the

104
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,800
second

105
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,220
okay zero so this is a mistake yeah

106
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,020
[Music]

107
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,259
okay so actually it's here yeah

108
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,940
sorry so this one should be here right

109
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,160
okay

110
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,320
so what's the sun yeah is this the

111
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,699
minimum one two three four four seven

112
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,100
it's the same right it's the same as

113
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,220
sorting right one two three four four

114
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,919
seven so one two three four

115
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,780
four seven yeah okay so this is

116
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,259
basically the same as sorting but we use

117
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,540
the Pakistan because we know there can

118
00:04:54,259 --> 00:05:00,120
different digits and then we just count

119
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,740
how many of them but when we count it we

120
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,419
can pick the numbers from the left hand

121
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,979
side to the right hand side so we are

122
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,720
now dealing with the numbers here we are

123
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,699
not in number one number two number

124
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,220
three number four if there are more than

125
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,419
one we can just keep doing that am I

126
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,520
right this makes sense

127
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,080
yeah okay let me try another example

128
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,580
okay just to make sure you actually

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,560
understand

130
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:25,080
and then we can do the coding okay so uh

131
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,759
try another number right

132
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:32,460
um four four three two two seven seven

133
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,039
six okay how many numbers a number let's

134
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,199
make it another zero here certain

135
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,419
package yeah

136
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,080
okay this is ten bucket

137
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,080
four

138
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,539
four

139
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,800
make it two right

140
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,880
three

141
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,160
one

142
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,400
two one

143
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
two make it to one yeah that's one not

144
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,199
two

145
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,120
one not two okay so yeah that was a

146
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,800
mistake yeah you always listening yeah

147
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,539
that was testing

148
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:09,780
okay good job seven six

149
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:11,340
yellow yeah so what are the rest what

150
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,340
should I put here it's yellow okay good

151
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,340
okay

152
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,039
now okay so now S1 S2

153
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,100
we have one zeros

154
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:26,100
so where should I put it on the number

155
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,860
yeah okay

156
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,280
okay now move it what do we do is it

157
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,280
nothing

158
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,500
okay and

159
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,000
and then give it to your first number

160
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,419
yeah and

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,819
one move where because two huh

162
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:46,259
and what's next put three in the second

163
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,319
three

164
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,759
and

165
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,160
perform in the first room and then put

166
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,039
four in the second string yeah then move

167
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,100
and then skip dancing and then put six

168
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,880
in the first ring and then move on and

169
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,360
then

170
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,220
put seven in the 739 the first ring and

171
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,280
then it's getting arrested okay so this

172
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,280
is

173
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,139
my sense zero two three three four four

174
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,240
six seven yeah so it's basically this

175
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,880
number plus this number

176
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,039
okay why can't we do it why this

177
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,380
approach is okay

178
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:26,400
can you just say okay why this is the

179
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:28,860
gives the optimum the minimum because

180
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,620
because place values and you can put

181
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,099
digits in different place values because

182
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,919
like there's in the fat one's column two

183
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,860
tens column like if you put like a one

184
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,660
in the ones column will be one but if

185
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,060
you put one's in like a thousand column

186
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,120
it'll be a thousand so it'll get B more

187
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,880
so you want to give a smaller so you put

188
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,099
the the smallest number or in the bigger

189
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,319
values and the bigger numbers in the

190
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:57,720
smaller values so they'll they'll uh

191
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,880
value less good job yes that's basically

192
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,160
it yeah so basically we are sorting yeah

193
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,020
it's the same as sorting right so last

194
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,080
time when we sold it we just sold it

195
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,900
right what do we get zero two two three

196
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,460
four four six seven seven right and then

197
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,319
we

198
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,240
pick the number from left to the right

199
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,979
right this is the same thing right so we

200
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,539
just count it we have these ten buckets

201
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,520
because there are only 10 possible

202
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,500
digits and we just count how many times

203
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,660
they appear is there a packet right if

204
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,300
you have one more two you just increment

205
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,160
the counter two and then we try from the

206
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,080
left to the right because the left this

207
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,240
is the zero the smallest

208
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,880
five zero one two this is in the

209
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,779
sourcing order and if it's zero if the

210
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,779
counter is zero just get

211
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:45,360
it is the the Sorting this is the faster

212
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:48,060
why is it faster because we only have 10

213
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,580
buckets if we are empty it here

214
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,339
we just go through these end times and

215
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,980
then we have all the digits in place

216
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,680
right but for 13 if not regular salt in

217
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,200
quick shot the time complexity is O and

218
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,300
again right and then if we use the

219
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,140
bucket sorting look what's the tandemic

220
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,899
speed

221
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,580
what's the time from Leslie OS right

222
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,680
which one is better this one is better

223
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,300
right because they have 10 buckets so it

224
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,800
just goes to one

225
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,440
okay

226
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,200
okay so yeah that's a strategy but

227
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,940
writing this in code may not be elegant

228
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
as the first approach remember the first

229
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,779
approach is just three line number two

230
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,300
right but for this one it takes the more

231
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:30,060
than three lines of code and it's not as

232
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:34,260
elegant as the first approach the bucket

233
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:37,260
equals at the beginning 10 10 buckets

234
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,260
four

235
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:48,540
I in this n Str n converted to a string

236
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,899
this I and then B integer I automated

237
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:54,740
back to the index the values plus equals

238
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,060
one right this is bucket oh yeah

239
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,060
incrementing we are putting the numbers

240
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,560
in the bucket right this is the bucket

241
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,140
and we're putting the we go through the

242
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,720
digits and we put in the DJI to that

243
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,880
bucket okay and

244
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,180
and once we have that then we can start

245
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,899
S1 equals zero S2 equals zero right and

246
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,399
y i equals zero wire I is smaller than

247
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,720
10.

248
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,480
all right

249
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,820
first of all we need to skip the packet

250
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,100
which is yellow so

251
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,140
how do we skip the bucket which is you

252
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,140
know wire

253
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:36,000
why I is smaller than 10 and

254
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:41,120
s i is is actually p i is is actually

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,120
zero then I plus equal one right

256
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,920
so we skip the empty packets and then

257
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,320
and now we need to take the numbers

258
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,380
right we need to take the numbers so so

259
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:56,160
how do we take a number S1 equals S1

260
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:59,279
times 10 plus now this is the bucket we

261
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,899
are now a bucket I so packet I now once

262
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,760
we take the one bucket what should we do

263
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,700
with it we need to decrement the counter

264
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,279
right

265
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:11,040
I take one four already so I need to

266
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,260
decrement it to one right so right now I

267
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,440
take this eye and I need to decrement it

268
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:19,260
which is b i minus equal one so once we

269
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,180
take this bucket now we need to check if

270
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,360
the voltage is for the next number right

271
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:27,240
so we need to obviously we need to keep

272
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,380
skipping this digit right and

273
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:34,940
p i if if zero then still I plus equal

274
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:37,380
one and if I is already as a 10

275
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:41,760
if we are using up all the digits then

276
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:46,800
we just break otherwise S2 equals S2

277
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,180
times 10 plus I and p i minus equal one

278
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,519
okay

279
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,880
and then at the end return

280
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,399
S1 plus S2

281
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,240
okay so look at this is not very elegant

282
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,060
right

283
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,660
because there's some

284
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:06,120
special case we have to make yeah but

285
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,940
the strategy the point is that

286
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,399
we take the digit we all always take the

287
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,459
digit in turn right in turn and then we

288
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,320
move the counter I

289
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:20,820
move this I to the right until it

290
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,579
reaches the the 10th for example the S1

291
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,700
is zero to four right so if I take the

292
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:30,480
digit six what does the S1 become

293
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,100
now S1 is 24 so if I take the one more

294
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,279
digit and put it on the right what does

295
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,360
as one become

296
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:40,320
246 I

297
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:44,100
so how do we get 246 from 24

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,040
24 times 10. and put a 6 on the right

299
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,740
let's let's basically it right so we

300
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,040
multiply the number current value times

301
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,200
10 means that okay this is the number I

302
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,480
have I multiply it by 10.

303
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,240
yeah yeah I squeeze one

304
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,839
location for for the new digit right

305
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,139
this is 24. so 24 becomes 240 plus 6.

306
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,380
this is where it is well done so we

307
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:13,200
take the number Take the bucket I and we

308
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,680
need to decrement it right take a move

309
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,420
it and then we move to the right okay

310
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,360
okay that's it what have you learned

311
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,060
today I learned about how to what we

312
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,880
didn't like last time we could end on

313
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,579
Monday about it's fine it's splitting

314
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,339
number and I don't remember and today

315
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:35,459
we're using bucket sort okay so okay so

316
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:38,160
what is bucket sorting bucket sorting is

317
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:41,100
basically using buckets or counters

318
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,899
yes okay okay and then you and then you

319
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,120
lay them out and can't get enough of

320
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,639
them put them in the rebels inside and

321
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,740
they don't have right hammer and then

322
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,420
you go through them and then just put

323
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,399
them in three one strings and keep a

324
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,760
good part yeah the fucking sauce is

325
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:59,100
useful if we know the lumber the the

326
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,540
data the data type is limited for

327
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,579
example in this case there are only 10

328
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,740
digits right so we can go through it

329
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:07,019
once and put it in different buckets but

330
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,420
if the data is a lot of the you know

331
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:12,959
different contents you can always have

332
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:15,120
unlimited buckets all right

333
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,360
make sense if you have if you have

334
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,720
unlimited packets the performance will

335
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,240
be not as efficient as this limited

336
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,620
buckets make sense anyway any comments

337
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,560
no

338
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,560
that's it for today bye bye bye bye
