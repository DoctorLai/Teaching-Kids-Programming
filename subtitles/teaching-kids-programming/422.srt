1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
go

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,759
hello mr mr right now you're right yeah

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,040
yeah okay so we talk about uh

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,480
geometry metric geometry

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,400
geometrics

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,440
for question today okay

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,359
so

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,160
what does it mean it means that you're

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,920
not trying let's say yeah give a

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,680
simple example two

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,720
one two three

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:31,039
four eight sixteen

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,039
thirty two sixteen times two to each

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,640
[Music]

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,600
256

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,120
81 it's a if odd number how come it's

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,120
even all right so it's 200.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,359
okay so uh omega progression is like the

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,359
first number is a and the second number

20
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,680
is a times q

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,200
the third number is a times q to the

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,520
power of two yeah take something and

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,640
then a time two cubic

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,560
yeah

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,479
so okay so if you write these two and

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,680
then i'll beat threes oh yeah a times q4

27
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,200
etc

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,280
q not equals to zero and q not equals to

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
one right

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,720
make sense

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,360
if q equals one then all the numbers

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,759
will be a right

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,840
if a q is zero it doesn't make quite

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,159
sense right so in the first number

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,000
will be zero

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,360
it'll be a there is zero

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,920
okay so

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,000
so these these eight numbers are one two

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,640
three four five six seven eight numbers

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,799
add it up to 255 one good way to

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,479
visualize it is you put this number into

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:58,079
binary so the binary this is one this is

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,719
one zero this is one zero zero this is

44
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,880
one zero zero zero yeah et cetera so if

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,680
you add it together that will be

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,239
what

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:12,239
one one one one one one one one yeah

48
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:16,959
this is this this in binary is one

49
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:20,000
is one followed by eight zeros

50
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,440
yeah one two three four five six seven

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,560
and

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,720
minus one right so this number

53
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,120
all right this number

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,120
two to the power of one two three four

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,640
five six seven eight

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,400
minus one this number 256 minus one

57
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,800
equals 255

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,560
okay this is the number yeah

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,599
correct okay that's how we get it but

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,680
but if it's an ana geometry progression

61
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,760
geometric okay how do you pronounce

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:55,840
these geometric geometric

63
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,599
matrix is geometric geometric okay

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,879
for example like

65
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,159
3

66
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,159
9 27 81

67
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,159
240

68
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,159
[Music]

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,319
wow that was quick

70
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,200
363

71
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,840
okay i'm not sure okay let's check okay

72
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,680
but before that i want to cut

73
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,640
we want to learn how to pick your names

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,440
yeah but this a what's the a in here in

75
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,720
in this series three three which is a

76
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,280
equal three what's the q

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,560
q equals one

78
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,400
sorry

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,280
three three not sorry three three

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,159
q

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,720
q q what's q q is a

82
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,720
n minus divided by m

83
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,720
yeah

84
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,439
the subsequent number nine divided by

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,239
three is three twenty seven divided by

86
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:02,480
nine is three

87
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,480
243 divided by 81 what's the answer

88
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,879
um

89
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,000
what three come on

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,200
i was just checking i was just checking

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,879
if you're listening

92
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,760
divided by three

93
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,519
so

94
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,919
the next number divided by previous

95
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,280
number is always always q okay that's

96
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,600
what it says

97
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,600
okay

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,160
yeah yeah okay now now okay so we want

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,080
to know okay so basically look if we

100
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,800
have this a1

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:39,199
plus a2 plus a3 plus a4 here kn we want

102
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:43,600
to know the sum that the sum sn equals

103
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,880
sum of a i where i equals

104
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,600
i equals 1 to n right so we want to sum

105
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,919
it we want to sum all the numbers yeah

106
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,520
yeah so like how do we get it as n

107
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,400
equals this right so sn

108
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,199
s n equals

109
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,479
so s n equals this right

110
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,960
then i can times q because q is not zero

111
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,479
so i can times q to both sides so what

112
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,520
does it become

113
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,560
q times s n equals

114
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,479
q

115
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,919
times a one plus q times a two plus q

116
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,280
times a three plus p two to the q times

117
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,560
a n okay

118
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,960
yeah

119
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,840
what's q times a y

120
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,600
q times a one is

121
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,199
what a

122
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,919
one

123
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,590
a two a two okay q times a one is a two

124
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,760
yeah okay q times a two equals one

125
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,760
[Music]

126
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:03,760
[Music]

127
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:12,800
so if i subtract these from sn so sn

128
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,840
minus q times sn equals sn minus d

129
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,280
single

130
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,880
so sn minus this thing a2 plus a3 plus

131
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
a4 theta a

132
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,730
[Music]

133
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,840
sn

134
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,400
minus qsn how many sn are left

135
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,360
uh

136
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,639
common terms s n so that's one here so

137
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,160
what

138
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,120
to the two a

139
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,160
minus three a equals one how many a's uh

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,680
minus one name yeah so

141
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,199
one s n

142
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,080
subtract qsn how many sn

143
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,680
um

144
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,520
one

145
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,160
minus

146
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,039
q yeah subtract common term

147
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:05,759
okay here this is a tricky part

148
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:08,800
s n equals a 1 plus f s n is here yeah

149
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,440
yeah i want to take away let's look like

150
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,720
i want to take away these a two a three

151
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,120
a four a

152
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,840
tier a and plus one from here so what's

153
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,840
left

154
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,280
you get it sn is this pic

155
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,360
sn is this big

156
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,560
i want to take away a2 a3 a4 till a n

157
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
plus one from sn so what are the common

158
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,560
terms here

159
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,800
what are the common terms

160
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,800
um

161
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,840
yeah a2 a3 a4 yeah

162
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,759
a yeah

163
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,879
until a n

164
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,319
but a1 is left right and a n

165
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,479
so it's a

166
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,879
one minus a m plus one right yeah

167
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,800
okay so what's a sn

168
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,280
s n equals a one minus a n plus one

169
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,800
divided by one minus cube

170
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,840
right what's a n plus one

171
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,680
a n plus one equals a

172
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,520
times q

173
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,240
n right

174
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:19,680
yeah yeah makes sense look

175
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:23,599
a two equals a times q1 yeah a3 equals a

176
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,720
times q2 right so a n plus one equals a

177
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,879
times q right make a q n right

178
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,240
so that equals what a

179
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,360
times

180
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,080
a 1 minus a 1 times q

181
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,839
n divided by 1 minus q if i have extract

182
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,839
the common terms equals

183
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,080
a y minus q n

184
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,360
divided by one minus q okay so let's

185
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,399
let's let's do the equation this bit

186
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,480
okay

187
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,959
okay so let's come back to that question

188
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,880
yeah what was that question

189
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,760
what's that

190
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,760
3 plus

191
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,720
9 plus 27 plus 81 plus

192
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,080
243 yeah

193
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,160
yeah

194
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,160
your answer is what three hundred three

195
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,760
six three three six three okay i'm not

196
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,360
sure let's check this what's a

197
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,320
three yeah

198
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,839
so three times one minus what's q

199
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,160
what's cube 90 is three three three nine

200
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,839
divided by three is three three three to

201
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,600
the power of how many terms one two

202
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,160
three four five

203
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,800
to the power of five divided by

204
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,720
one minus three all right so what's this

205
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,240
answer so it's look we this is negative

206
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,200
minus 2 right minus 2

207
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,600
so

208
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,160
3 to the power 5 is bigger than 1 so i

209
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,040
can just reverse the sign so it's

210
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,760
3 to the power five minus one right

211
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,760
what's three to the power five

212
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,760
how many three five what's this

213
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,279
what's this number uh 243

214
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,720
243 okay 243

215
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,959
minus 1

216
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,839
242 right

217
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,839
divided by 2

218
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,680
121 times 3

219
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,279
363

220
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,160
okay

221
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,920
yeah we're done okay so how about the

222
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,920
first one one plus two plus three let's

223
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,839
give another plus four

224
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,040
plus t uh to

225
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,880
128 okay let's use this equation again

226
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,200
let's use this equation

227
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,640
a what's a one

228
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,200
one times

229
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,959
one minus one can you wrap up the minus

230
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,040
one two minus two

231
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,839
that's a very good question because look

232
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,600
1 minus q and actually if i look 1 minus

233
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,519
q to the power because q to the power of

234
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,959
n is bigger right this is negative this

235
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,519
is negative

236
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,360
yeah so if i reverse the 2

237
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,800
this speed it will be q minus 1 and then

238
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,279
it's the same thing

239
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,680
q minus n to the power n this is the

240
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,680
same man

241
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,720
yeah

242
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,600
2 over 3

243
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,560
i put the minus sign it's the same right

244
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,720
if this is equal right

245
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,560
okay so look

246
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,360
a is one

247
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,160
a is one right a is one

248
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
uh where are we a is one q q is two

249
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,600
right

250
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,160
two four divided by two is two

251
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,160
two to the power

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,959
ah that's okay two to the power a minus

253
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,240
one divided by

254
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,720
too what

255
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,720
what's this

256
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,920
[Music]

257
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,279
divided okay so what's the okay

258
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,279
okay

259
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,839
okey-dokey

260
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,240
oh why why this is not right this is not

261
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,839
right what's good one one plus two plus

262
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,959
four plus

263
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,399
uh

264
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,920
plus

265
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,519
a plus six uh sixteen clear 120 how many

266
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,560
how many are they

267
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,360
how many how many terms are they

268
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
there are eight right

269
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,720
okay so why why this is not right okay q

270
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,440
minus one q what's cube q is two right

271
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,480
a is one

272
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,279
q is 2 q is 2

273
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,800
q is 2 okay q is 2.

274
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,519
2 minus 1 a 1 is 1

275
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,480
a 1 is 1 how many terms are there q q to

276
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:42,720
the power of to the power of n

277
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,480
q is two to the power of a minus one

278
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,760
okay okay

279
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,160
two to the power of a is what

280
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,959
256

281
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,680
yeah oh yeah 256

282
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,959
okay this is minus one okay that's right

283
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,839
two to the power of eight two minus 256

284
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,519
minus one 255 divided by one okay i

285
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,519
forgot to minus one that's why it's like

286
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,040
you got it okay i'm going to i'm going

287
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,320
to write the equation here and then you

288
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,320
need to tell me the sum okay

289
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,079
i write down the equation you don't have

290
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,360
to remember it but you need to know how

291
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,720
we're getting it

292
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,040
so sn equals a

293
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,040
1

294
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,040
q

295
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,279
n minus 1

296
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,279
q minus one okay

297
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,440
okay let's i'm going to write another

298
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,639
series okay number series

299
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,959
uh

300
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:48,320
geometry geometric geometry progression

301
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,519
um okay so let's say

302
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,680
five

303
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,079
plus

304
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,920
five times plus 10.

305
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,120
no no that would be too easy

306
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,120
15

307
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,480
plus 45

308
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,480
plus what's next

309
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,040
yeah

310
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,800
plus what's next

311
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,240
time three

312
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,720
what was that

313
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,440
405

314
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,399
405 okay okay what's the design what's

315
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,399
the what's the sound

316
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,440
what's a a one is what

317
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,800
55

318
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,920
what's kill

319
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,639
three

320
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,880
three what's n how many

321
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,920
one two three four five

322
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,560
minus one divided by what's cube

323
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,720
three three minus one okay this is okay

324
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,880
let's let's confirm

325
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,000
two that's two five

326
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,680
uh

327
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,240
times three to the power of five how

328
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,240
many threes

329
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,199
no no no three times to the power of

330
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,160
five how many three

331
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,040
243

332
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,600
43 yeah minus one okay so that's one

333
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,800
three two 202

334
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,360
divided by two 121

335
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,360
times five

336
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,160
six oh five yeah

337
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,959
yeah okay let's add the number together

338
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,519
let's see if it's six or five okay if

339
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,920
it's six or one then we're done

340
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,920
20

341
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,639
65

342
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,880
200

343
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,000
605 okay

344
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
okay

345
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,920
yeah

346
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,120
that's mathematics today okay yeah

347
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,279
yes

348
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,720
wait wait wait look

349
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,560
to come back to coding okay you'll be

350
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,560
easier i quickly write it you know to

351
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,560
calculate so we just we just need three

352
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,480
parameters a q n yeah

353
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,079
and define

354
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,839
define uh let's say sum

355
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,120
okay so we just click a at

356
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,720
a1 q

357
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,199
n right

358
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,480
yeah so x equals zero

359
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,279
for

360
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,160
i

361
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:08,320
in rank

362
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,920
n right n s plus equals

363
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,890
a1

364
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,160
times

365
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:16,160
[Music]

366
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,160
times what times i times q right it is

367
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,720
simple as that because the first time

368
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,759
the first term is a1

369
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,240
a1 plus plus i times q right we got a

370
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,199
one plus i is zero at the first time so

371
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,040
it'd be let's do a1

372
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,079
and we can

373
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,800
s you get it look i is from zero to n

374
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,120
minus one so so we're adding a one and

375
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,880
the second one i will be one a one plus

376
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,560
q

377
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,120
uh is it

378
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,240
no no no no no no no

379
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,120
no no no no no no no it's not it's we

380
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,079
are adding a 1 plus a

381
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,839
1

382
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,920
times q

383
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,720
plus a 1 times b 2 okay so so it's not

384
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,040
look

385
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,760
this is a 1 times q a 1 times q 0 right

386
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,679
q1 so is a1

387
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,240
times q

388
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,520
to the power of i right to the power of

389
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,760
y how do we say to the power of i

390
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,400
q to the power all right we can do this

391
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
double star

392
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,809
[Music]

393
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,280
a to the power of b

394
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,960
you can write three way you can say a

395
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,760
times times b

396
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,000
in python okay or you can use this

397
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,400
power function master power

398
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,320
a b okay

399
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,520
make sense look away

400
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,840
so look

401
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,679
a one

402
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,160
because look the first time the first

403
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,320
term is a one times q zero q z what's q

404
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,360
here

405
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,360
q to the power of zero

406
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,799
no

407
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,360
a two to the power of 0 is what 3 to the

408
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:07,360
power is 0 equals 1

409
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:10,000
1 any power a to the power of 0 equals 1

410
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,640
a not equal to 0 okay

411
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,640
when a is not 0 any anything to the

412
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,720
power of zero

413
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,039
is one a hundred to the power of zero

414
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,039
equals one one

415
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,160
two thousand to the powers you know one

416
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,280
one

417
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
everything

418
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,799
yeah

419
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,799
one one one

420
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,480
because in mathematics

421
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,679
it's invalid

422
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,919
yeah there is no such thing as 0 to the

423
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,360
power 0. it's not defined

424
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,480
got it yeah

425
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,799
okay

426
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,120
that's it for today bye bye

427
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,120
bye bye
