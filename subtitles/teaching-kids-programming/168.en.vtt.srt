yesterday
 

7
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,629
yesterday
binary tree and the way to work

8
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
binary tree and the way to work
 

9
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:18,710
binary tree and the way to work
divided by everything

10
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720

 

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,510

sum divided by the number that's the

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
sum divided by the number that's the
 

13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,390
sum divided by the number that's the
average okay

14
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:22,400
average okay
 

15
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,550
average okay
and we use the breakfast search which

16
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
and we use the breakfast search which
 

17
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,189
and we use the breakfast search which
travel the tree level by level right

18
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
travel the tree level by level right
 

19
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,230
travel the tree level by level right
yeah that's a sum that's the mathematics

20
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
yeah that's a sum that's the mathematics
 

21
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,710
yeah that's a sum that's the mathematics
symbol

22
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
symbol
 

23
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,990
symbol
to represent the sum the sum sum okay

24
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
to represent the sum the sum sum okay
 

25
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,350
to represent the sum the sum sum okay
sum sum up the numbers how is that

26
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
sum sum up the numbers how is that
 

27
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,990
sum sum up the numbers how is that
sum that's the mathematics symbol okay

28
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
sum that's the mathematics symbol okay
 

29
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,430
sum that's the mathematics symbol okay
this level by level

30
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
this level by level
 

31
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,430
this level by level
right we use the breakfast search with

32
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
right we use the breakfast search with
 

33
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,350
right we use the breakfast search with
the help of which data structure

34
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
the help of which data structure
 

35
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,549
the help of which data structure
we should have done this that will be

36
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
we should have done this that will be
 

37
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,430
we should have done this that will be
the problem

38
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
the problem
 

39
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,110
the problem
so yeah no it has this

40
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
so yeah no it has this
 

41
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,110
so yeah no it has this
what kind of data structure are we using

42
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
what kind of data structure are we using
 

43
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,389
what kind of data structure are we using
the professor

44
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
the professor
 

45
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:09,910
the professor
oh

46
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:09,920

 

47
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,550

so if i want to travel the tree using

48
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
so if i want to travel the tree using
 

49
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,030
so if i want to travel the tree using
the

50
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
the
 

51
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,870
the
therefore search the pre-order what's

52
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
therefore search the pre-order what's
 

53
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,390
therefore search the pre-order what's
the pre-order of this one

54
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
the pre-order of this one
 

55
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,749
the pre-order of this one
oh it's one two seven three four five

56
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
oh it's one two seven three four five
 

57
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,390
oh it's one two seven three four five
three four okay okay so

58
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
three four okay okay so
 

59
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,510
three four okay okay so
if i want to travel a different search

60
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
if i want to travel a different search
 

61
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:29,910
if i want to travel a different search
uh

62
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
uh
 

63
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,910
uh
the binary is using different search

64
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
the binary is using different search
 

65
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,469
the binary is using different search
then i can pass on the levels yeah i

66
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
then i can pass on the levels yeah i
 

67
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,069
then i can pass on the levels yeah i
know which level

68
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:36,079
know which level
 

69
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,950
know which level
uh my current note is that when i

70
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
uh my current note is that when i
 

71
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,590
uh my current note is that when i
traverse

72
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
traverse
 

73
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,270
traverse
to the next to the left or right tree

74
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
to the next to the left or right tree
 

75
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,149
to the next to the left or right tree
we need to increment the level right

76
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
we need to increment the level right
 

77
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,389
we need to increment the level right
yeah and then we can use a

78
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
yeah and then we can use a
 

79
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,190
yeah and then we can use a
list to store the notes all right all

80
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
list to store the notes all right all
 

81
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,870
list to store the notes all right all
right

82
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
right
 

83
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,030
right
so what i mean is look everywhere look

84
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
so what i mean is look everywhere look
 

85
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,630
so what i mean is look everywhere look
at me don't play

86
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
at me don't play
 

87
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,030
at me don't play
so i have a list of look when i travel

88
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
so i have a list of look when i travel
 

89
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,749
so i have a list of look when i travel
here this is the level zero and i put a

90
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
here this is the level zero and i put a
 

91
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,709
here this is the level zero and i put a
zero here at the level level here okay

92
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
zero here at the level level here okay
 

93
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,590
zero here at the level level here okay
zero

94
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
zero
 

95
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,830
zero
and then i travel these two and three i

96
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
and then i travel these two and three i
 

97
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,869
and then i travel these two and three i
know that eleven

98
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
know that eleven
 

99
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,510
know that eleven
right is two and three so what do i do

100
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
right is two and three so what do i do
 

101
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,350
right is two and three so what do i do
this is level one and i put a two and

102
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
this is level one and i put a two and
 

103
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,990
this is level one and i put a two and
three here

104
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
three here
 

105
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,589
three here
right and then level two that would be

106
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
right and then level two that would be
 

107
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,869
right and then level two that would be
seven four five right as long as like i

108
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
seven four five right as long as like i
 

109
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,309
seven four five right as long as like i
know least least

110
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
know least least
 

111
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,869
know least least
right then i can calculate the average

112
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
right then i can calculate the average
 

113
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,350
right then i can calculate the average
right

114
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
right
 

115
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,910
right
because i know that i know the least

116
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
because i know that i know the least
 

117
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,869
because i know that i know the least
exactly

118
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
exactly
 

119
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,990
exactly
i think it's one sorry oh okay

120
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
i think it's one sorry oh okay
 

121
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,150
i think it's one sorry oh okay
one yeah so i know because i already

122
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
one yeah so i know because i already
 

123
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,350
one yeah so i know because i already
grouped them by levels so i know how to

124
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
grouped them by levels so i know how to
 

125
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,070
grouped them by levels so i know how to
calculate

126
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
calculate
 

127
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,270
calculate
the average yeah easily for this yeah

128
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
the average yeah easily for this yeah
 

129
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,350
the average yeah easily for this yeah
how do i calculate the average before

130
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
how do i calculate the average before
 

131
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,630
how do i calculate the average before
this my number this

132
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
this my number this
 

133
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,589
this my number this
list is ar right like one two three how

do you calculate this
 

137
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,910
do you calculate this
uh average for this one oh that would be

138
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
uh average for this one oh that would be
 

139
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,710
uh average for this one oh that would be
easy

140
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
easy
 

141
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,869
easy
yeah there's three of them say one two

142
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
yeah there's three of them say one two
 

143
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,149
yeah there's three of them say one two
three that's six

144

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
the number of these lengths how can i
 

171
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,070
the number of these lengths how can i
get the number

172
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
get the number
 

173
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,270
get the number
of the elements in the ar

174
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
of the elements in the ar
 

175
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,309
of the elements in the ar
using which function

176
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
using which function
 

177
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,990
using which function
start with air wait look it's

178
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
start with air wait look it's
 

179
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,229
start with air wait look it's
lambda then

180
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
lambda then
 

181
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,869
lambda then
okay so this is the way but you can do

182
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
okay so this is the way but you can do
 

183
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,270
okay so this is the way but you can do
this

184
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
this
 

185
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,229
this
you can use what how can you do this sum

186
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
you can use what how can you do this sum
 

187
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,030
you can use what how can you do this sum
sum

188
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
sum
 

189
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,710
sum
a r divided by what some ai is actually

190
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
a r divided by what some ai is actually
 

191
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,910
a r divided by what some ai is actually
this one right

192
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
this one right
 

193
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,429
this one right
so ar what's a divided by what

194
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
so ar what's a divided by what
 

195
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,270
so ar what's a divided by what
divided by the sum of sum divided by r

196
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
divided by the sum of sum divided by r
 

197
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,469
divided by the sum of sum divided by r
sum divided by n which is what i just

198
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
sum divided by n which is what i just
 

199
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,640
sum divided by n which is what i just
told you

200
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:23,650
told you
 

201
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,670
told you
[Music]

202
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680

 

203
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,790

this is ah sorry yeah okay

204
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
this is ah sorry yeah okay
 

205
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,070
this is ah sorry yeah okay
so this is average okay so the first

206
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
so this is average okay so the first
 

207
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,510
so this is average okay so the first
first step is to group the elements

208
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
first step is to group the elements
 

209
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,830
first step is to group the elements
to append the each note to each level

210
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
to append the each note to each level
 

211
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,510
to append the each note to each level
right all right doesn't make sense so as

212
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
right all right doesn't make sense so as
 

213
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,749
right all right doesn't make sense so as
long as we have a list of the

214
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
long as we have a list of the
 

215
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,189
long as we have a list of the
list of the notes for each level then we

216
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
list of the notes for each level then we
 

217
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:49,990
list of the notes for each level then we
can do this

218
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
can do this
 

219
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,670
can do this
easily right yeah okay i'm going to test

220
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
easily right yeah okay i'm going to test
 

221
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,030
easily right yeah okay i'm going to test
you okay just to make sure you

222
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
you okay just to make sure you
 

223
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,550
you okay just to make sure you
understand

224
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
understand
 

225
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,590
understand
how come because you look you look like

226
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
how come because you look you look like
 

227
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,550
how come because you look you look like
playing you're not

228
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
playing you're not
 

229
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,990
playing you're not
understanding okay define let's say

230
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
understanding okay define let's say
 

231
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,830
understanding okay define let's say
find average find average

232
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840

 

233
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,909

load column

234
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
load column
 

235
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,990
load column
okay then i have to define a definition

236
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
okay then i have to define a definition
 

237
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,029
okay then i have to define a definition
here okay

238
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
here okay
 

239
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,350
here okay
therefore search first of all i have a

240
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
therefore search first of all i have a
 

241
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,430
therefore search first of all i have a
root and then i want to pass along the

242
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
root and then i want to pass along the
 

243
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,310
root and then i want to pass along the
level

244
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
level
 

245
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,150
level
level with zero one two can you stop

246
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
level with zero one two can you stop
 

247
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,070
level with zero one two can you stop
doing that

248
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
doing that
 

249
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,670
doing that
level and then i will have a result

250
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
level and then i will have a result
 

251
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,749
level and then i will have a result
result for the list of the notes okay on

252
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
result for the list of the notes okay on
 

253
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,909
result for the list of the notes okay on
each level

254
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
each level
 

255
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,270
each level
right there if not root if the

256
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
right there if not root if the
 

257
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,189
right there if not root if the
load is empty there's nothing we can do

258
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
load is empty there's nothing we can do
 

259
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,430
load is empty there's nothing we can do
we just return yeah

260
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440

 

261
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,950

okay now i have a list which is uh

262
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
okay now i have a list which is uh
 

263
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,150
okay now i have a list which is uh
at the beginning is empty

264
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
at the beginning is empty
 

265
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,270
at the beginning is empty
now i need to find if

266
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
now i need to find if
 

267
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,550
now i need to find if
the level is bigger or equal than

268
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
the level is bigger or equal than
 

269
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,230
the level is bigger or equal than
length length is

270
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
length length is
 

271
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,469
length length is
okay so we found a new level i want to

272
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
okay so we found a new level i want to
 

273
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,350
okay so we found a new level i want to
push this

274
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
push this
 

275
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,870
push this
result so i stop

276
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
result so i stop
 

277
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,950
result so i stop
a pen a new route yeah which is a list

278
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
a pen a new route yeah which is a list
 

279
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,070
a pen a new route yeah which is a list
of the

280
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
of the
 

281
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,710
of the
we currently found finding a new level

282
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
we currently found finding a new level
 

283
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,870
we currently found finding a new level
so i want to push the level in it

284
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
so i want to push the level in it
 

285
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:23,270
so i want to push the level in it
right do the value right okay as

286
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280

 

287
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,309

look this is the key thing

288
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
look this is the key thing
 

289
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,150
look this is the key thing
okay the lever dot append open one

290
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
okay the lever dot append open one
 

291
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:49,029
okay the lever dot append open one
and open what

292
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039

 

293
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,790

and then what happened to the level if i

294
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
and then what happened to the level if i
 

295
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,629
and then what happened to the level if i
go down what happened to the level

296
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
go down what happened to the level
 

297
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,070
go down what happened to the level
level plus one result yeah

298
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
level plus one result yeah
 

299
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,790
level plus one result yeah
okay and then we don't write double

300
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
okay and then we don't write double
 

301
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,350
okay and then we don't write double
first one result

302
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
first one result
 

303
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,110
first one result
okay so can you explain to me what's

304
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
okay so can you explain to me what's
 

305
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,629
okay so can you explain to me what's
what's these two

306
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
what's these two
 

307
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,950
what's these two
yeah okay

308
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960

 

309
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,070

um of uh like

310
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
um of uh like
 

311
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,670
um of uh like
getting a new level

312
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
getting a new level
 

313
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,950
getting a new level
yeah stuff like that

314
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
yeah stuff like that
 

315
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,189
yeah stuff like that
so when you go down you're passing the

316
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
so when you go down you're passing the
 

317
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,629
so when you go down you're passing the
level plus one right

318
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
level plus one right
 

319
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,350
level plus one right
yeah and then you're passing the left

320
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
yeah and then you're passing the left
 

321
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,749
yeah and then you're passing the left
okay

322
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
okay
 

323
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,589
okay
and then look if i call i need to call

324
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
and then look if i call i need to call
 

325
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,350
and then look if i call i need to call
this yeah therefore search

326
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
this yeah therefore search
 

327
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,390
this yeah therefore search
eric therefore search root and what

328
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
eric therefore search root and what
 

329
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,670
eric therefore search root and what
should i put at the beginning in the

330
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
should i put at the beginning in the
 

331
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,550
should i put at the beginning in the
second period

332
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
second period
 

333
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,070
second period
if i want to call it what's the

334
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
if i want to call it what's the
 

335
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,790
if i want to call it what's the
beginning of the level

336
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800

 

337
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,749

what's the low value no this is the

338

no no yeah i haven't calculated the
 

363
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,390
no no yeah i haven't calculated the
leverage what did i do here what did i

364
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
leverage what did i do here what did i
 

365
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,909
leverage what did i do here what did i
do these two

366
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
do these two
 

367
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,670
do these two
look if i go to the one level zero and i

368
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
look if i go to the one level zero and i
 

369
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,230
look if i go to the one level zero and i
put a put a zero here which is one

370
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
put a put a zero here which is one
 

371
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,310
put a put a zero here which is one
and a list of these yeah and the second

372
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
and a list of these yeah and the second
 

373
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,389
and a list of these yeah and the second
number is two and three right

374
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
number is two and three right
 

375
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,949
number is two and three right
and the third level is what so the level

376
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
and the third level is what so the level
 

377
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,909
and the third level is what so the level
is what can you tell me

378
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
is what can you tell me
 

379
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,710
is what can you tell me
three and four four just four okay so

380
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
three and four four just four okay so
 

381
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,030
three and four four just four okay so
this

this
 

383
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,070
this
this will be is okay after this call the

384
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
this will be is okay after this call the
 

385
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,590
this will be is okay after this call the
definition should be used to be based

386
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
definition should be used to be based
 

387
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:49,990
definition should be used to be based
right

388
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
right
 

389
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,070
right
and i want to return the average for

390
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
and i want to return the average for
 

391
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,110
and i want to return the average for
each level right

392
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
each level right
 

393
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,190
each level right
so i need to do this return

394
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200

 

395
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,630

sum i just say sum x

396
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
sum i just say sum x
 

397
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,829
sum i just say sum x
divided by yeah but not yet i'm

398
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
divided by yeah but not yet i'm
 

399
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,590
divided by yeah but not yet i'm
talking about this okay i know what

400
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
talking about this okay i know what
 

401
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,870
talking about this okay i know what
divided by 1

402
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880

divided by the length length x
 

407
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,630
divided by the length length x
yeah and then for x

408
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
yeah and then for x
 

409
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,389
yeah and then for x
in result ah yes okay so let's

410
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
in result ah yes okay so let's
 

411
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,670
in result ah yes okay so let's
start with these these will become

412
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
start with these these will become
 

413
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,710
start with these these will become
erin these will turn these into

414
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
erin these will turn these into
 

415
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,790
erin these will turn these into
one can you tell me

416
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800

 

417
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,829

what one one yeah and then

418
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839
what one one yeah and then
 

419
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,389
what one one yeah and then
uh no it will be one and then what

420
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
uh no it will be one and then what
 

421
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,829
uh no it will be one and then what
t3 so

422
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839
t3 so
 

423
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,870
t3 so
so this will be is and what will happen

424
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
so this will be is and what will happen
 

425
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,070
so this will be is and what will happen
here sum

426
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
here sum
 

427
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,269
here sum
x divided by length x for x in is so

428
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
x divided by length x for x in is so
 

429
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,910
x divided by length x for x in is so
what's what what's your order

430
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920

 

431
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,269

2.5 yeah and then four yeah so

432
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
2.5 yeah and then four yeah so
 

433
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,110
2.5 yeah and then four yeah so
that will become this yeah does it make

434
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
that will become this yeah does it make
 

435
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,949
that will become this yeah does it make

not quite exactly is look if there are
 

489
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,190
not quite exactly is look if there are
levels in here so which level i need to

490
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
levels in here so which level i need to
 

491
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,150
levels in here so which level i need to
append to

499
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,590
can you okay can you can you write it i
yes i yes which level of this because we

500
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
yes i yes which level of this because we
 

501
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:49,990
yes i yes which level of this because we
know

502

506
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
value okay come on you need to
 

507
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,590
value okay come on you need to
understand okay

508
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
understand okay
 

509
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,949
understand okay
does it make sense oh yes yeah which

510
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
does it make sense oh yes yeah which
 

511
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:01,990
does it make sense oh yes yeah which
level is it

512
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
level is it
 

513
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,470
level is it
bracket level

514
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480

 

515
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,069

bracket yeah bracket square

516
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
bracket yeah bracket square
 

517
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,829
bracket yeah bracket square
square bracket level and dot append yeah

518
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
square bracket level and dot append yeah
 

519
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,389
square bracket level and dot append yeah
because we are appending load of value

520
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:16,399
because we are appending load of value
 

521
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,670
because we are appending load of value
to least level

522
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
to least level
 

523
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,509
to least level
to this level doesn't make sense

524
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519

 

525
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,750

come on it's quite simple why you still

526
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
come on it's quite simple why you still
 

527
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,710
come on it's quite simple why you still
not remembering

528
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
not remembering
 

529
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,910
not remembering
no there's no you don't need to append

530
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
no there's no you don't need to append
 

531
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,750
no there's no you don't need to append
the list you need you're appending the

532
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
the list you need you're appending the
 

533
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,750
the list you need you're appending the
value right the first time

534
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
value right the first time
 

535
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,670
value right the first time
is appending on this doesn't make sense

536
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
is appending on this doesn't make sense
 

537
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,910
is appending on this doesn't make sense
do the value

when you're calling the function you
 

559
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,150
when you're calling the function you
need a bracket remember you're not doing

560
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
need a bracket remember you're not doing
 

561
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,150
need a bracket remember you're not doing
that

565
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,470

and then break it yeah and wow how do

566
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
and then break it yeah and wow how do
 

567
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,829
and then break it yeah and wow how do
you get the average

568
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839
you get the average
 

569
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:31,829
you get the average
yep

for x for x in what in some
 

575
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,110
for x for x in what in some
result is that

yeah yeah you see if i ask you to write
 

579
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,310
yeah yeah you see if i ask you to write
it you'll remember more right does it

580
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
it you'll remember more right does it
 

581
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,470
it you'll remember more right does it
make sense you understand more yeah

582
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
make sense you understand more yeah
 

583
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,189
make sense you understand more yeah
doesn't make sense all right can you

584
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
doesn't make sense all right can you
 

585
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,310
doesn't make sense all right can you
tell me what's this

586
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
tell me what's this
 

587
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,949
tell me what's this
why there's a if thingy it would be hard

588
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
why there's a if thingy it would be hard
 

589
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,230
why there's a if thingy it would be hard
to understand right

590
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
to understand right
 

591
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,590
to understand right
so if the level is

592
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
so if the level is
 

593
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,590
so if the level is
if we are rich we are going to the next

594
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
if we are rich we are going to the next
 

595
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,629
if we are rich we are going to the next
level and we need to append it to

596
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
level and we need to append it to
 

597
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,160
level and we need to append it to
next level then

598
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,170
next level then
 

599
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,829

this is the result eric this is the
 

605
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,230
this is the result eric this is the
result

606
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
result
 

607
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,670
result
beginning is empty and then if i if i'm

608
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
beginning is empty and then if i if i'm
 

609
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,269
beginning is empty and then if i if i'm
reaching a new level the first time i

610
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
reaching a new level the first time i
 

611
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,470
reaching a new level the first time i
look okay this is one and here yeah if i

612
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
look okay this is one and here yeah if i
 

613
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,269
look okay this is one and here yeah if i
go to the two

614
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
go to the two
 

615
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,230
go to the two
all right go to the two but this list

616
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
all right go to the two but this list
 

617
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,110
all right go to the two but this list
doesn't have a

618
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
doesn't have a
 

619
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,269
doesn't have a
two level so what what do i do i go here

620
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
two level so what what do i do i go here
 

621
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,710
two level so what what do i do i go here
and i put a two here

622
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
and i put a two here
 

623
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,350
and i put a two here
right okay then this result will be here

624
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
right okay then this result will be here
 

625
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,990
right okay then this result will be here
right look

626
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
right look
 

627
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,430
right look
yeah and then when i visit three

628
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
yeah and then when i visit three
 

629
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,750
yeah and then when i visit three
yeah instead of putting it back because

630
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
yeah instead of putting it back because
 

631
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,509
yeah instead of putting it back because
it belongs to some level as too

632
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
it belongs to some level as too
 

633
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,310
it belongs to some level as too
yeah so what should i do this one is

634
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
yeah so what should i do this one is
 

635
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,910
yeah so what should i do this one is
level here which is here

636
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
level here which is here
 

637
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,629
level here which is here
apparent root of value so i i o does it

638
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
apparent root of value so i i o does it
 

639
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,470
apparent root of value so i i o does it
make sense that's what it means

640
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480
make sense that's what it means
 

641
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,310
make sense that's what it means
yeah okay yeah

642
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
yeah okay yeah
 

643
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,629
yeah okay yeah
doesn't make sense larry you understand
