hello mr ariel are you right yes okay so
how do you i give you a sequence okay

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799
how do you i give you a sequence okay
 

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,390
how do you i give you a sequence okay
like one three five seven nine do you

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
like one three five seven nine do you
 

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,230
like one three five seven nine do you
notice what's so special about this

8
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
notice what's so special about this
 

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,030
notice what's so special about this
sequence

10
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040

 

11
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,189

know they're um odd

12
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
know they're um odd
 

13
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,230
know they're um odd
all numbers okay and how about

14
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
all numbers okay and how about
 

15
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,189
all numbers okay and how about
look if it is one five

16
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
look if it is one five
 

17
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,230
look if it is one five
seven

18
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
seven
 

19
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,230
seven
this this is not special but this one is

20
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
this this is not special but this one is
 

21
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,150
this this is not special but this one is
special why is that

22
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
special why is that
 

23
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,269
special why is that
because

24
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:29,279
because
 

25
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,990
because
the odd numbers these are all numbers

26
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
the odd numbers these are all numbers
 

27
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,430
the odd numbers these are all numbers
but how what's so special about this one

28
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
but how what's so special about this one
 

29
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,470
but how what's so special about this one
um

30
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
um
 

31
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,190
um
i think it's

32
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
i think it's
 

33
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,310
i think it's
huh

34
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
huh
 

35
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,150
huh
um

36
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
um
 

37
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,780
um
what's that

38
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:43,790
what's that
 

39
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,869
what's that
[Music]

40
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879

 

41
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,670

they're all adding two adding two okay

42
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
they're all adding two adding two okay
 

43
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,430
they're all adding two adding two okay
so the distance between each number is

44
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
so the distance between each number is
 

45
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,150
so the distance between each number is
two right it's the same okay so like one

46
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
two right it's the same okay so like one
 

47
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,869
two right it's the same okay so like one
two three four five this is also that

48
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
two three four five this is also that
 

49
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,270
two three four five this is also that
how do you write calling what speller

50
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
how do you write calling what speller
 

51
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,910
how do you write calling what speller
was a r i

52
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
was a r i
 

53
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,550
was a r i
a r i t h

54
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560
a r i t h
 

55
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,230
a r i t h
t h

56
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240

58
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
m
 

59
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,190
m
e t i c c

60
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200

 

61
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,910

yeah sequence we call this aromatic

62
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
yeah sequence we call this aromatic
 

63
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,230
yeah sequence we call this aromatic
sequence so each number

64
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
sequence so each number
 

65
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,469
sequence so each number
the distance between each number is the

66
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
the distance between each number is the
 

67
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,830
the distance between each number is the
same but

68
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
same but
 

69
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,870
same but
what what we mean is distance is the the

70
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
what what we mean is distance is the the
 

71
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,030
what what we mean is distance is the the
next number minus the previous number

72
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
next number minus the previous number
 

73
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,830
next number minus the previous number
okay so how about is one five

74
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
okay so how about is one five
 

75
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,590
okay so how about is one five
one five one

76
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600

 

77
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,230

right the distance is also four but look

78
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
right the distance is also four but look
 

79
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,350
right the distance is also four but look
five minus one is four one minus five is

80
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
five minus one is four one minus five is
 

81
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,630
five minus one is four one minus five is
minus four and four so this is not right

82
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
minus four and four so this is not right
 

83
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,990
minus four and four so this is not right
this is not

84
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
this is not
 

85
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,190
this is not
right so we we are looking for the

86
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
right so we we are looking for the
 

87
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,870
right so we we are looking for the
numbers that uh the first number is a

88
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
numbers that uh the first number is a
 

89
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,310
numbers that uh the first number is a
yeah the second number is a plus b

90
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
yeah the second number is a plus b
 

91
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,149
yeah the second number is a plus b
the third number is a plus two times d

92
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
the third number is a plus two times d
 

93
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,389
the third number is a plus two times d
and the next number is what

94
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
and the next number is what
 

95
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,030
and the next number is what
a plus three times d etcetera okay right

96
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
a plus three times d etcetera okay right
 

97
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,790
a plus three times d etcetera okay right
a so

98
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
a so
 

99
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,869
a so
the whole sequence you can put it as a

100
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
the whole sequence you can put it as a
 

101
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,670
the whole sequence you can put it as a
time a plus k times d

102
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
time a plus k times d
 

103
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,910
time a plus k times d
okay so for given it's not

104
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
okay so for given it's not
 

105
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,630
okay so for given it's not
uh

106
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
uh
 

107
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,190
uh
so can you can you tell me

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
so can you can you tell me
 

109
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,350
so can you can you tell me
all right can you tell me what's a and d

110
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
all right can you tell me what's a and d
 

111
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,150
all right can you tell me what's a and d
in for list 1 3 5 7 9 11 et cetera

112
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
in for list 1 3 5 7 9 11 et cetera

what's a

114
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
what's a
 

115
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,630
what's a

right what's a
 

119
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,869
right what's a
the a is the first number which one one

120
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
the a is the first number which one one
 

121
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,110
the a is the first number which one one
one okay and what

122
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
one okay and what
 

123
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,910
one okay and what
what's k uh what's k is the number okay

124
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
what's k uh what's k is the number okay
 

125
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,470
what's k uh what's k is the number okay
what's d

126
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480

 

127
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,830

what's d

128
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
what's d
 

129
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,229
what's d
d is the decision what's t

130
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
d is the decision what's t
 

131
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,630
d is the decision what's t
two okay so look this this sequence we

132
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
two okay so look this this sequence we
 

133
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,630
two okay so look this this sequence we
can write it as what one plus 2 times k

134
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
can write it as what one plus 2 times k
 

135
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,670
can write it as what one plus 2 times k
1 k equals 0 is 1

136
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
1 k equals 0 is 1
 

137
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,710
1 k equals 0 is 1
k equals 1 is 3 k equals 2

138
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
k equals 1 is 3 k equals 2
 

139
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,750
k equals 1 is 3 k equals 2
is 5 k equals 3 equals 7 okay

140
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
is 5 k equals 3 equals 7 okay
 

141
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,309
is 5 k equals 3 equals 7 okay
yeah okay so now we we know this

142
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
yeah okay so now we we know this
 

143
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,630
yeah okay so now we we know this
sequence ok so so i give you a few

144
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
sequence ok so so i give you a few
 

145
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,589
sequence ok so so i give you a few
numbers like uh but they are not in

146
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
numbers like uh but they are not in
 

147
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,390
numbers like uh but they are not in
essentially in order so for example 7

148
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
essentially in order so for example 7
 

149
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,509
essentially in order so for example 7
3

150
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
3
 

151
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,949
3
1 5.

152
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
1 5.
 

153
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,750
1 5.
so can you tell me how can you rearrange

154
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
so can you tell me how can you rearrange
 

155
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,470
so can you tell me how can you rearrange
these numbers to make it a animatic

156
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
these numbers to make it a animatic
 

157
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,670
these numbers to make it a animatic
sequence

158
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
sequence
 

159
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,670
sequence
so you become what

160
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
so you become what
 

161
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,070
so you become what
so can you do

162
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
so can you do
 

163
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,509
so can you do
one three five seven easy one three five

164
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
one three five seven easy one three five
 

165
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,789
one three five seven easy one three five
seven okay

166
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
seven okay
 

167
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,710
seven okay
okay easy okay so

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,789
okay easy okay so
given a list of these numbers not

170
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
given a list of these numbers not
 

171
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,789
given a list of these numbers not
essentially in order can you tell me if

172
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
essentially in order can you tell me if
 

173
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,869
essentially in order can you tell me if
you can rearrange the sequence to make

174
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
you can rearrange the sequence to make
 

175
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,430
you can rearrange the sequence to make
it aromatic sequence so what's your

176
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
it aromatic sequence so what's your
 

177
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,789
it aromatic sequence so what's your
thoughts

178
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
thoughts
 

179
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,830
thoughts
how do you do it um

180
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840

 

181
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,910

how do you know it's one okay from this

182
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
how do you know it's one okay from this
 

183
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,509
how do you know it's one okay from this
three seven one five how do you know

184
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
three seven one five how do you know
 

185
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,830
three seven one five how do you know
it's one oh you can do it one three five

186
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
it's one oh you can do it one three five
 

187
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,309
it's one oh you can do it one three five
seven come on it's it's very obvious how

188
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
seven come on it's it's very obvious how
 

189
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,470
seven come on it's it's very obvious how
do you do it

190
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
do you do it
 

191
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,309
do you do it
how do you do something come on how do

192
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
how do you do something come on how do
 

193
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,309
how do you do something come on how do
you do it

194
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
you do it
 

195
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,229
you do it
um you definitely start with a smoothie

196
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
um you definitely start with a smoothie
 

197
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,550
um you definitely start with a smoothie
yeah smaller speakers and how do we call

198
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
yeah smaller speakers and how do we call
 

199
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,149
yeah smaller speakers and how do we call
it how to check

200
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
it how to check
 

201
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,309
it how to check
we can what

202
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
we can what
 

203
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,470
we can what
we can work

204
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
we can work
 

205
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,509
we can work
we can

206
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519

 

207
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,710

check

208
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
check
 

209
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,030
check
how can we check how can we only give a

210
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
how can we check how can we only give a
 

211
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,270
how can we check how can we only give a
second number and then use our

212
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
second number and then use our
 

213
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,230
second number and then use our
previous one okay so before we do that

214
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
previous one okay so before we do that
 

215
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,830
previous one okay so before we do that
we want to what we want to what the

216
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
we want to what we want to what the
 

217
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,629
we want to what we want to what the
numbers come on we want to what

218
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
numbers come on we want to what
 

219
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,710
numbers come on we want to what
we want to put in the verb here

220
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
we want to put in the verb here
 

221
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,030
we want to put in the verb here
the numbers can you can you imagine how

222
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
the numbers can you can you imagine how
 

223
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,150
the numbers can you can you imagine how
do it

224
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
do it
 

225
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,310
do it
yeah that's the word i'm looking for a

226
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
yeah that's the word i'm looking for a
 

227
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,629
yeah that's the word i'm looking for a
thought yeah we saw that

228
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
thought yeah we saw that
 

229
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,749
thought yeah we saw that
so what's the certain time come next day

230
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
so what's the certain time come next day
 

231
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,430
so what's the certain time come next day
if that number what's the time

232
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
if that number what's the time
 

233
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,150
if that number what's the time
competitive if we sort the numbers

234
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
competitive if we sort the numbers
 

235
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,350
competitive if we sort the numbers
um

236
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
um
 

237
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,830
um
again yeah

238
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
again yeah
 

239
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,790
again yeah
okay okay so we only saw the numbers and

240
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
okay okay so we only saw the numbers and
 

241
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,110
okay okay so we only saw the numbers and
if we saw the numbers how do we check if

242
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
if we saw the numbers how do we check if
 

243
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,350
if we saw the numbers how do we check if
it's a aromatic sequence

244
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
it's a aromatic sequence
 

245
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,350
it's a aromatic sequence
uh if we go to the second number

246
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
uh if we go to the second number
 

247
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,990
uh if we go to the second number
minus subtract the previous one yeah and

248
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
minus subtract the previous one yeah and
 

249
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,909
minus subtract the previous one yeah and
then we check it

250
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
then we check it
 

251
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,749
then we check it
and the distance that needs to be the

252
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
and the distance that needs to be the
 

253
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,590
and the distance that needs to be the
same right

254
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
same right
 

255
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,390
same right
and how do we check if the distance

256
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
and how do we check if the distance
 

257
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,629
and how do we check if the distance
is the same we can put the distance in a

258
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
is the same we can put the distance in a
 

259
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,870
is the same we can put the distance in a
set and we can't finally count the

260
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
set and we can't finally count the
 

261
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,710
set and we can't finally count the
number of the distance

262
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
number of the distance
 

263
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,710
number of the distance
unique distance in the set it has to be

264
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
unique distance in the set it has to be
 

265
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,830
unique distance in the set it has to be
one right

266
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
one right
 

267
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,790
one right
right

268
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
right
 

269
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,110
right
yeah we can use the set yeah notebook

270
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
yeah we can use the set yeah notebook
 

271
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,909
yeah we can use the set yeah notebook
okay

272
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
okay
 

273
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,029
okay
okay so

274
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
okay so
 

275
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,590
okay so
let's say defy

276
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
let's say defy
 

277
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,909
let's say defy
is an arithmetic sequence okay

278
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
is an arithmetic sequence okay
 

279
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,150
is an arithmetic sequence okay
and numbers

280
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
and numbers
 

281
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,350
and numbers
first of all we only thought yeah nouns

282
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
first of all we only thought yeah nouns
 

283
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,510
first of all we only thought yeah nouns
dark soul right

284
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
dark soul right
 

285
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,390
dark soul right
okay then we we put a distance in a set

286
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
okay then we we put a distance in a set
 

287
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:59,430
okay then we we put a distance in a set
the active

288
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440

 

289
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,510

we start with the second number so what

290
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
we start with the second number so what
 

291
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,790
we start with the second number so what
should we put here

292
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
should we put here
 

293
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,710
should we put here
we start with the second number so what

294
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
we start with the second number so what
 

295
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,790
we start with the second number so what
should we range will be

296
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
should we range will be
 

297
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,590
should we range will be
one one and then to the length of the

298
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
one one and then to the length of the
 

299
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,390
one one and then to the length of the
numbers

300
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400

 

301
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,469

okay then the distance is what we we

302
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
okay then the distance is what we we
 

303
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,950
okay then the distance is what we we
want to find is this d dot add

304
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
want to find is this d dot add
 

305
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:32,550
want to find is this d dot add
what's the distance we want to put

306
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560

 

307
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:45,510

the previous

308
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520

 

309
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,550

or any bigger than one will return wha

310
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
or any bigger than one will return wha
 

311
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,950
or any bigger than one will return wha
what does this mean if now if this set

312
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
what does this mean if now if this set
 

313
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,469
what does this mean if now if this set
contains

314
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
contains
 

315
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,430
contains
two different distance then we know it's

316
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
two different distance then we know it's
 

317
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,790
two different distance then we know it's
not a

318
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
not a
 

319
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,790
not a
aromatic sequence right

320
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
aromatic sequence right
 

321
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,710
aromatic sequence right
that's how we determine

322
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
that's how we determine
 

323
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,710
that's how we determine
we don't know what

324
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
we don't know what
 

325
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,390
we don't know what
okay

326
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
okay
 

327
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,309
okay
and then here we can just return because

328
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
and then here we can just return because
 

329
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,550
and then here we can just return because
we already checked here so we can return

330
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
we already checked here so we can return
 

331
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,270
we already checked here so we can return
one

332
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280

 

333
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,749

okay like if if i don't if i remove this

334
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
okay like if if i don't if i remove this
 

335
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:23,430
okay like if if i don't if i remove this
one so what should i do right here

336

distance is equals one okay
 

341
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,550
distance is equals one okay
do we actually need to

342
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
do we actually need to
 

343
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,790
do we actually need to
to put a set

344
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
to put a set
 

345
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,350
to put a set
no okay if i tell you i don't want this

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,990
complexity of this hole again yeah
because this is dominating yeah this is

416
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
because this is dominating yeah this is
 

417
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,550
because this is dominating yeah this is
bigger than that you can say all nokia

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
bigger than that you can say all nokia
 

419
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,990
bigger than that you can say all nokia
plus n right and this is constant i mean

420
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
plus n right and this is constant i mean
 

421
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,230
plus n right and this is constant i mean
this is adding together but so this one

422
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
this is adding together but so this one
 

423
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,030
this is adding together but so this one
dominating so you you can drop this

424
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
dominating so you you can drop this
 

425
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,430
dominating so you you can drop this
this one is dominant because it it takes

this one is dominant because it it takes
 

427
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,710
this one is dominant because it it takes
more time right

428
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
more time right
 

429
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,470
more time right

without a notebook okay any anyone think
about it how do we check if the number

452
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
about it how do we check if the number
 

453
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,870
about it how do we check if the number
we already started and how we are going

subtract the i minus one right
 

505
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,269
subtract the i minus one right
if we know equals
