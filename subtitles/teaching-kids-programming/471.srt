1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,200
hello mr mr right now right

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,080
what have we done yesterday what's this

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,639
what have you learned back

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,240
no what's the sum of the time of the

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,920
tickets the leaves yeah yesterday we

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,960
were using the deficit recursion

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,039
deficits

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,240
you know we can implement a different

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,640
search in

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,600
iterated using the stack but it's uh

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,760
easier to implement using a recursion

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,039
right and then look at this thing

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,359
dictionary

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,439
hashmap we use it to keep tracking of

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,040
the sound we accumulate the sum for each

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,800
level the keys will be the levels the

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,640
values will be the same right and then

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,480
when we go down we will traverse the

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,719
left tree and right three will pass down

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,719
the level when we reach the note in the

21
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,039
next in the left triad and the right

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,200
side the level will be plus one right

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,120
and i'll use this level to

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,280
accumulate the sum here

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,039
we do this different search recursion it

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,399
doesn't matter which order we visit the

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,920
left tree first or right three but it

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,559
doesn't matter as long as we traverse

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,120
the

30
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,879
tree in a different uh definition

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,520
manner and then all the nodes will be

32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,519
visited exactly once and

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,920
in order to return the

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,880
sum of the deepest leaf

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,000
we need to compute with next d dot keys

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,080
is the maximum the deepest level i know

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,640
is the key is to retrieve the sum of the

38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,960
of the dps level okay

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,920
so let's definitely search so can you

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,600
guess what are we talking about today

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,680
exactly yeah we're using the processors

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,200
to solve this problem

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,200
so what is the perfect search

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,880
how do we travel what's the what's the

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,799
pressure

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,400
i mean what order for example like if

47
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,400
this is the binary tree what are the

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,320
one two three four five

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,280
six

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,680
seven

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,799
eight okay one two three four five six

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,799
seven eight but if we're using the

53
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,799
pre-order search

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,799
in order

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,240
what's in order

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,000
left

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,119
note right okay so left four

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,239
goes down

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,040
four one two three no no no no if it's

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,080
one if that's that's pre-order pre-order

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,640
is not left right then it's wrong it's

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,520
uh when you say it's correct one two

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,239
four

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,440
five six seven eight three okay but if

65
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,280
it's uh

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,200
in order so we go to the left three

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
first then which is the note and which

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
the right three so that'll be

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
two

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,959
four

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,319
two

72
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,120
one five

73
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,760
uh

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
five one three

75
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
six

76
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,040
five

77
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,680
seven six eight no no four for the note

78
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,599
uh for the left no to right for this

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,519
three so what other would be left three

80
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,519
we visit the left tree first yeah so

81
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,319
this one will go first and then one to

82
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,840
here so one tree at the end okay and in

83
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,000
order to visit these three in the no uh

84
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,000
in order so what do we what do we have

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,959
so we did left three first

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,040
right

87
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,519
that's three note and the right three

88
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,280
all right so it's four two and this bit

89
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,959
is this bit yeah

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,200
so again with the customer what's what

91
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,440
how do we visit this tree

92
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,840
so five yeah five because it has nothing

93
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,800
on the left five

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,159
five and then this bit

95
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,280
what was that

96
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,599
that's easier seven six eight yeah

97
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,680
seven six eight do you get it so all

98
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,560
together for the inorder is four two

99
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,159
five seven six a one three correct

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,040
yeah

101
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,040
for the first search we use the q dq

102
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,799
double and dq right

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,959
all right so

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,360
for example this one one okay i

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,840
shouldn't have erased this okay but

106
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,840
let's do this

107
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,080
okay that's a simple final treat okay so

108
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,319
we have a q dq first of all the we put a

109
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,439
note in it once

110
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,159
then

111
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,599
we dequeue all the notes in the queue

112
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,360
because they belongs to the same number

113
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,519
what's the kit of the one

114
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,680
two three two three and then we incur it

115
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,840
one by one okay and then we take all we

116
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,360
dequeue everything in the key because

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,519
two and three don't stand level we take

118
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,880
it out what's the kit of two and three

119
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,840
four five six seven yeah exactly

120
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,239
okay

121
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,600
so every time look this is the standard

122
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,040
breakfast search every time we take

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,040
everything out

124
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,560
when we push the kids

125
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,120
we're gonna push the kids back to the

126
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,600
queue then we can compute the sum we can

127
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,440
compute the sum of all the kids right

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,320
so now in this case the

129
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,280
the sum the sum will be updated

130
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,080
to four plus five plus six plus seven

131
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,080
right

132
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
but we keep updating the sum well every

133
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,639
level we dequeue every node right so

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,800
that we set we reset the sum to zero so

135
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,160
basically we just use the variable

136
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,320
answer to keep tracking of the sum of

137
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,400
the next

138
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,960
level right and when the preference

139
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,479
search terminates the sum will be

140
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,000
the sum of the la maximum level which is

141
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,639
the details

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,759
defined by first search okay node

143
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,639
root

144
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,759
okay

145
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,919
if not root we don't need to continue

146
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,520
return zero okay

147
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,919
and then

148
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,960
q equals dq

149
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,360
we put the root in it right

150
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,520
and then we have this answer sum equals

151
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,440
zero at the beginning and y and q why

152
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,039
there is a node in the queue so first of

153
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,639
all we need to get how many nodes the

154
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,960
number of nodes in the queue in the left

155
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,639
belongs to some level and length skill

156
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,280
and now we just have to

157
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,280
decube all these end nodes in range n

158
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,919
now first of all answer i have to copy

159
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,160
here i i have to reset it to zero right

160
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,240
that's what i'm saying answer equals

161
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,039
zero we reset this answer to zero

162
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,039
because that represents the sum of the

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,680
next level okay

164
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,440
and then what here's a

165
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,919
current equals q dot problem

166
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,880
and then if current on left what do we

167
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,880
do q

168
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,720
what should we do

169
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,520
can you feel the blank

170
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,520
q dot append

171
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,840
and now we need to uh answer plus input

172
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,800
yeah this is

173
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,600
no no no current current on that

174
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,800
i know what's this

175
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,440
answer plus current value okay

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,319
i'm gonna return

177
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,479
okay

178
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,880
this one yeah because we need to

179
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,880
accumulate some for the next level but

180
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,120
we are not accumulating the sum for all

181
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,720
the notes because we are resetting the

182
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,440
sum to zero

183
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,880
yeah make make sense yeah so okay can

184
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,479
you can you tell me what have you

185
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,160
learned today by this breakfast search

186
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,960
what are we trying to do today we're

187
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,199
trying to find the some of the deepest

188
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,479
leaves in the binary cream

189
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,479
and how we doing it

190
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,479
what does it mean double yeah two sides

191
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
and we can do this

192
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,639
a pen a pen to the right pop to the left

193
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,720
uh popular right

194
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,120
a pen up and left

195
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,639
top left okay so if you want to push in

196
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
or take it out from the left hand side

197
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,319
we have to put the left

198
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
to say it's from the left otherwise it's

199
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,000
from the right okay and then these four

200
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,880
operations are constant 01 constant time

201
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,199
right

202
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,360
yeah we can use the lift

203
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,000
yeah if we use if we declare the q

204
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,720
equals this empty list we can still use

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,879
the

206
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,759
use it as a

207
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,240
queue

208
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,120
but we have to use this top zero but

209
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,479
this is expensive this is linear time

210
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,280
okay that's why we use the dq because

211
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,759
this top left

212
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,400
is one which is better than this one

213
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,879
which is one linear term okay

214
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,960
okay so why why do we need to reset this

215
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,960
to zero at the beginning answer equals

216
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,720
zero and the answer is one right which

217
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,520
is sum of the next level and i set it to

218
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,639
zero answer equals two plus three five

219
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,639
okay

220
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,400
and i i set it to the answer equals four

221
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,240
plus five okay so can you tell me why we

222
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,080
need to set it to 0

223
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,879
what would this answer be if i don't

224
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,200
reset the 0 for h each level so what's

225
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,200
the sum going to be

226
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,279
all of the next we're down it'll be the

227
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,440
sum of all the notes i said we set it to

228
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,399
0. every time i start with the new level

229
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
right

230
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,959
yeah for them

231
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,600
does it make sense now yeah okay that

232
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,600
will be it for today good job bye bye

233
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
bye
