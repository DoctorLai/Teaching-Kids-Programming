1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,870
[Music]

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,960
a triple roman

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,800
it could be a final research final tree

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,359
or it could be a tree you know with

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,480
multiple kids right so let's say three

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,920
ninety-nine kids one yeah yeah yeah

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,960
five ten

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,199
okay

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,640
there's only two yeah

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,079
but it could be money yeah it could be

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,079
that many like i said it could be many

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,040
seven and it could be something like

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,239
that

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,480
and you'll be

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,480
uh you know

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,960
some it could be many

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,960
many many

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,879
so let's say if i want to take the five

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
out and the question is that when you

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,640
take the five you need to take all the

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,680
notes

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
uh

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,840
yeah good question okay so you have hey

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,480
i said

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,559
so these notes are unique

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,400
so if i want to take the 5 out you need

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,400
to tell me how many notes we need to

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,920
take it out if

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,159
if you're taking the 5 out you need to

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,439
take every single note every note in

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,400
itself

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,520
only child okay so

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,360
so

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,880
oh children yeah so you need to tell me

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,799
it's five and ten okay right five if i

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,240
take the fight off take the fight off

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,159
let's say kill it okay if i want to

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,759
you need to tell me kill it

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,439
you need to tell me come on come on okay

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,439
5 10. i'm killing it okay

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,159
hey five ten or you can return 10

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,799
seconds only if i want to take a seven

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,799
hour so you need to

44
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,150
[Music]

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,360
uh so

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,679
but the thing is that you are given the

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,039
fine of the tree you know because it

48
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,040
might not be the binary tree you're

49
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,720
given a tree like that you're giving me

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,879
for example this tree could be given

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,560
these notes as three

52
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,599
one five

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,480
seven

54
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,520
ten

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,800
four nine eleven right

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,120
this is

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,599
you're doing it by breakfast

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,920
yeah okay wait wait

59
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,959
yeah yeah we're done okay so now look

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,959
what's the parent of them if the note is

61
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,959
a root which does not have any parent we

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,959
give it the experience yellow okay

63
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,400
that's the zero is especially very means

64
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,959
that look at the

65
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,400
root of three the pattern of three is

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,800
zero

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,360
right yeah we're gonna kill it okay so

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,160
the parent of one is what

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,000
parent of one is three

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,000
five

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,640
three the seventh three ten five

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,840
four seven seven seven we're done so you

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,879
get it

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,120
look with these two information the node

75
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,879
and their parents okay because we only

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,239
have distinct numbers yeah we only have

77
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,879
unique numbers

78
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,640
so we need to if this is

79
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,920
what can we do about it what can we do

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,000
about it

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,120
zero plus three

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
duplicate it two times uh last two three

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,799
five

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
yeah

85
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,959
yeah

86
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,239
okay

87
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
so we also take for example we want to

88
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,959
take the five out so what's your

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,560
approach

90
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,280
first we want to take a five hour so

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,280
what's your approach

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,200
so look we can go through this this uh

93
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,040
we can go through this at least yeah

94
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,599
right look we can go through this list

95
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,920
and check which parents

96
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,400
which parents is five

97
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,720
right which parent is five

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,959
whose parent is five ten right

99
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,959
ten

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,879
look we have to take this out yeah we

101
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,640
want to take this off

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,840
okay look at listen we want to take this

103
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,720
out so we go through this

104
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,720
array yeah

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,600
to check we go uh we go through this

106
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,440
away to check which which uh which

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,360
parent is

108
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,600
five

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,360
please look at this one

110
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,840
yeah which one is the time

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,160
10 yeah we're here we find here right

112
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,960
and then 10 that's not 10 then it will

113
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,000
be here and then we go

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,280
okay and then 10 will be taken right 10

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,479
will be taken and

116
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,240
but we also need to take that any note

117
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,800
right yeah suppose there are many many

118
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,440
notes here right so we then we need to

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,040
because we call this function to take

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,440
the note whose parent is 10 right

121
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,280
nobody's parents can

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,440
good question if that nobody's parents

123
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,120
is turned then we just stop right for

124
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,919
example that these knows

125
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,520
leave now there are no parents

126
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,360
yeah these notes

127
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,479
terminal notes we also call it terminal

128
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,840
stuff

129
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,840
because there were no parents

130
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,160
that the these no does not have any kids

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,520
okay so in other words no

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,520
no no parents is that this note okay

133
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,440
yes make sense so that's a very

134
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,440
straightforward idea

135
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,840
right we want to take the 5r so with

136
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,160
those who list the array to find out

137
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,080
whose parent is this note and then we

138
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,919
add it to the to the answer and now we

139
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,479
recursively recalling

140
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,039
calling the function with the

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,360
the id who's whose parent is that right

142
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,520
correct so in this case we

143
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,400
we can we can we compare the answer

144
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,400
right so

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,199
so let's try this this is called proof

146
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,199
of proofing

147
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,840
but but it's not very efficient right

148
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,840
why is that because every time we need

149
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,199
to go slowly away to find out

150
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
whose parent

151
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,720
is like

152
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,800
who's now whose parent is that right and

153
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,319
we can the other way think about it how

154
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,680
can we speed up this query so basically

155
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,759
we want to find out whose kids so what

156
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,479
what are we doing there we want to find

157
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,600
out whose parent is that the the note

158
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,120
right

159
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,919
look

160
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,919
before we have we know that note

161
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,600
we have given a note we we can know

162
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,000
whose parent is there right because it

163
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,400
only has one parent that's one to one

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,280
a man into one yeah so a note

165
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,199
can have only one parent right

166
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,440
we want to find out who's

167
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,440
who's no we want to find out which we go

168
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,080
through this note we want to find out

169
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,240
you know this is n and one

170
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,960
and two could be n3 they are all point

171
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,479
their parents or yeah right we will go

172
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,520
through this array

173
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,360
to find out whose parent is p right

174
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,639
right this is not very efficient every

175
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,639
time we need to go through that again

176
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,440
and again again right so if for example

177
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,759
if a note is like that one two

178
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,599
three four right

179
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,680
yeah we're going to go we want to find

180
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,360
out one right yeah killer one right

181
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,840
yeah but first of all we need to go

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,520
through that four notes again

183
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,520
to find out whose parent immediate

184
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,800
parents one right okay i'm gonna find

185
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,880
out too right

186
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,199
okay then i need to go through the list

187
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,800
again to find out whose parent is two

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,400
right so i need to

189
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,319
do that again

190
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,759
and then i need to find three yeah four

191
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,680
three and i need to go through the list

192
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,759
again to find out whose parent

193
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,080
is is three years

194
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
four plus four yeah you see plus four

195
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,720
percent

196
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,080
what but why but if why do we need to

197
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
plus four

198
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,280
i mean no no what i mean is that that's

199
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,800
one note no because because um because

200
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,720
even this

201
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,520
and why is like

202
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,840
like why is like two always having three

203
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,960
always at the end and then like four is

204
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,960
always that we end because

205
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,479
one two three four yeah one two three

206
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,520
four yeah another note would be zero

207
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,840
one

208
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,560
two three right yeah but like when you

209
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,400
get to two it's not overlapping

210
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,560
plus three

211
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,160
i don't get your question

212
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,520
because like uh

213
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,879
three

214
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,160
three four

215
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,879
plus four you need to plus three

216
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,280
but but the thing is yeah okay okay

217
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,120
that's very good observation yeah but we

218
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,159
are talking about uh

219
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,800
complexities okay so so in this case

220
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,519
yeah you're right you it could be m plus

221
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,200
n minus one plus minus two y

222
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,000
and plus n minus two yeah because we

223
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,640
already found it right yeah yeah

224
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,880
yeah but this is still

225
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,560
this is still you know

226
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,040
that that could be n time yeah that

227
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,800
could be and no if there are unknowns

228
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,320
and then you need to do this

229
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,600
n times yeah

230
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,959
plus

231
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,560
and what's the time complexity for this

232
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:09,200
m plus 1 n plus 1 times

233
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,640
times n divided by two so that's o n

234
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,640
squared right

235
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,399
yeah let's open square that's the terms

236
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,560
of x t okay

237
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,480
okay so so should we write this first

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,959
and then think about it how can we speed

239
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,279
up because all we want to do is find out

240
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,839
the list of notes whose pattern is p and

241
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,880
how can we do this opposite

242
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,880
look can we do this opposite

243
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,000
huh

244
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,000
can we do this opposite

245
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,240
so if we do the opposite list that will

246
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,710
be one

247
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,720
all right

248
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,760
[Music]

249
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
no

250
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,000
now we are given the data structure

251
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,920
pointing the nodes

252
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,480
yeah p to the now there p to the nodes

253
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,760
will be n one and we can if we can do

254
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,760
this

255
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,800
if we can have this kind of data

256
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,120
structure we can easily do uh traversing

257
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,880
the tree right what kind of algorithm

258
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,399
can you have a sigma tree come on this

259
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,399
is the easy answer for you

260
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,640
so let's let's do this one by one okay

261
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,200
first of all through something

262
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,360
definite search and process search okay

263
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,600
define that let's just say here okay

264
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,760
here and then we have two numbers

265
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,320
numbers current and the number to key

266
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,320
okay okay

267
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,320
okay

268
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,399
so

269
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,760
first of all we need to do what we need

270
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,200
to go through like the answer would be

271
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,200
okay so if k equals

272
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,720
okay and then we need to do one for

273
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,839
in range we need to go through this

274
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,690
right

275
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,040
here

276
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,720
[Music]

277
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,839
ryan you got a question

278
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
no

279
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,640
if if p

280
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,440
question if p i so this is the very

281
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,680
parent if parent equals the k current k

282
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,839
to take take away right

283
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,959
then i need to answer

284
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,920
i need to answer plus here

285
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,680
and that will be n p but now i would

286
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,890
need to take that thing which is what

287
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,519
p

288
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,320
[Music]

289
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,839
n i and i

290
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,800
i learned with an answer no p

291
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,440
okay

292
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,240
so this is the profession oh look if k

293
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,560
equals zero that means that that's the

294
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,560
you know

295
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,120
that's the do not the root okay

296
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,519
if k equals zero we determine because

297
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,480
the the zero does not exist

298
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,000
now

299
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,720
obviously we need to

300
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,079
take the kr right to kill the k

301
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,399
right and then we go through this array

302
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,839
we go through this parent array and if

303
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,480
the parent equals the

304
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,240
thing

305
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,279
if the parent equals the thing to take

306
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,760
off

307
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,279
right and i need to take out what i need

308
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,680
to

309
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,920
recursively taking out

310
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,480
the note so what does it mean look

311
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,279
that's one two

312
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,519
three

313
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,639
four right so i want to take the one out

314
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,839
right

315
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,000
right

316
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
and then the answer equals okay all

317
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,959
right

318
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,399
now so answer i have the at least one

319
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,639
and i need to go through the element to

320
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,519
find out whose parent is one

321
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,440
yeah whose parent is the one here

322
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,920
two and five why

323
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,720
you just grew five yeah i know two and

324
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,480
five so what so look at this pattern two

325
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,959
and size pattern is k

326
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,639
this one so i need to recursively call

327
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,959
this function so take

328
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,920
the note taking the note two and five

329
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,440
out

330
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,680
right

331
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,040
and it's a plus two answer and then i i

332
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,800
return the answer

333
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,360
okay so that time connection that we

334
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,360
discussed

335
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,519
so look if we build this function so

336
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,079
look

337
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,800
look we we have n to p right so we want

338
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,519
to peel p to n p to n so what kind of

339
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,360
data structure can we use to to be an

340
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,639
apparent to the kids

341
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,639
what kind of data structure

342
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,519
the the thingy

343
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,000
you know

344
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,440
yeah the notebook okay so look let's say

345
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,839
cheer try children okay children igor

346
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,839
before

347
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,240
dictionary

348
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,519
and then because the king is the parent

349
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,160
that the what's the type of the kid

350
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,480
a parent can have many many kids right

351
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,920
so it could be at list right

352
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,320
at least yeah

353
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,959
so now i need to go through the

354
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,040
parents okay so let's this one look the

355
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,399
the the triumph

356
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,839
the triad the parents okay in what's

357
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,839
cheap function remember

358
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,480
mp what's deep what's

359
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,440
what's chip remember we talk about a

360
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,560
chip

361
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,000
what's chip

362
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,720
zip is what chip yeah

363
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,399
right so i typically n ends here p is

364
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,440
here i don't have this look at the look

365
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,360
of c

366
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,360
look at n array in the kite come on

367
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,839
look

368
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,399
amazing look at me n and p stick it

369
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,720
together so now c and n will take one

370
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,680
each other so right yeah

371
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,639
so look

372
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,800
and then i need to do what children

373
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,079
children parents right this is parent

374
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,570
right

375
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,709
not a pen

376
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,709
[Music]

377
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,040
i take one element from the notes and

378
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,880
then take one element from the p c and p

379
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,839
from n piece right

380
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,839
okay

381
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,240
so in this case then i can build a

382
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,639
parent to the kids array right the key

383
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,920
is the parent the kit is the

384
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,040
value is the list of the children that

385
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,000
right

386
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
am i right

387
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,639
i know with this stair structure i can

388
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,320
just easily do the differences easy okay

389
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,600
yeah i'll do this step define

390
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,040
define

391
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,079
that first search

392
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,920
so let's say the loot

393
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,639
right i know what look

394
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,800
answer at the beginning equals to the

395
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,360
load yeah

396
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,120
but yeah i want to take the loop down of

397
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,240
course the answer has to include the

398
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,880
rules okay yeah and then now i just need

399
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,600
to go through its kid it's a kid what's

400
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,160
the what's the i just need to go to the

401
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,279
kid of the lord right for i

402
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,880
in

403
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,519
children yeah we have these children

404
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,839
yeah children

405
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,839
dude

406
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,800
i know

407
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,880
what what do we do answer plus equal

408
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,480
for search i

409
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,320
and i return you see how easy is that

410
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,560
okay

411
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,839
make sense take a look

412
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,720
we're done cash okay just retain first

413
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,959
of all then we can need to return we can

414
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,959
return dfs to

415
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,959
key all right yeah okay you talk about

416
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,959
cash that's a very good point but

417
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,880
actually it doesn't have much why is

418
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,839
that look i want to keep here one two

419
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
three

420
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,920
four

421
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,360
five

422
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,519
six right if i only kill one right

423
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,839
i'm going downwards so i need to go

424
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,040
through two three i just want to release

425
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,279
right

426
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,800
if i kill i catch this doesn't help

427
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,600
because i don't need to visit it again

428
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,880
right

429
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,880
am right just checking if you're correct

430
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,600
do you understand what i'm talking look

431
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,240
why

432
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,720
why when is the cache user because look

433
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,039
if i want to kill one

434
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,880
if i later i want to call this q1 okay

435
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,480
but not for now i don't need to call it

436
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,480
again because look i want to kill one

437
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,919
again and then now i can find from this

438
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,319
standard structure i can find two and

439
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,480
three right so then i need to kill two

440
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,520
and kill three right from ko3 i need to

441
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,600
get kill four and kills here and from

442
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,320
there i'll kill six and kill five right

443
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,520
take six k5 so look for each each

444
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,600
function

445
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,200
for each load i only call one so i don't

446
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,640
need to put a cache

447
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,240
it doesn't help right

448
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
but look this is the difference to

449
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,200
understand with this this data structure

450
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,039
am i all right make sense

451
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,600
answer dot

452
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,760
dfs i look at this the return is the

453
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,080
list yeah okay look

454
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,200
listen to me the return this plus equal

455
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,160
is to extend it you can also do this

456
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,320
answer.extend is the same thing yeah

457
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,480
it's ten

458
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,840
what does it mean look if this is one

459
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,799
one plus

460
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,840
two three look this one look a list of

461
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,720
one

462
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:16,080
plus two three that will become a list

463
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,559
of one two three if this this is a you

464
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,799
can say a dot is ten two three another

465
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,600
list and it still will become this

466
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,280
it's the same okay make sense

467
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,280
okay with this they have solution we can

468
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,760
always use uh preferences okay i'm going

469
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,080
to easily write this okay so what kind

470
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,840
of data uh how can we implement a

471
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,360
preferred search remember we we need to

472
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,600
use uh

473
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,520
we need to use a data structure which is

474
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,880
called what

475
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,039
you know usually type of search is done

476
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,039
is implemented by the recursion

477
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,360
application of the stack

478
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,880
first thing that's all right

479
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,039
and what's the opposite

480
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,520
we need to do the process search

481
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,720
what's the data structure that is not

482
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,640
step

483
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,960
firstly

484
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,720
first thing first now okay that's what i

485
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,760
add

486
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,039
so look let's say 3 2

487
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
1

488
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,280
10

489
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,720
11

490
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,240
twelve

491
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,679
thirteen

492
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,799
five

493
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,720
six

494
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,559
seven okay so let's say i want to take a

495
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,840
one out what's the first one search

496
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,039
one

497
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,679
so look one you put one in right

498
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,440
you take the one out and you put it push

499
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,880
it to it alright sit down otherwise

500
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,360
people don't see it

501
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,200
you take one out you push the kids which

502
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,640
is 10 11 12.

503
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,760
in here all right push the baby okay and

504
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,919
then now i take all the kids up

505
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,160
from the queue and i push their kids so

506
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,400
which is thirteen five six seven got it

507
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,919
well kids could have kids

508
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,320
so they were kids

509
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,320
look at this so initiator will be level

510
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,360
by level okay make sense

511
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,360
yeah see there

512
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,880
so look let's say q

513
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,440
equals at the beginning we use the dq i

514
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,200
think you double and dq

515
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
and at the beginning we have the k

516
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,760
because that's the thing we are going to

517
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,360
take it out

518
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,559
and the answer would be

519
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,240
of course

520
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,360
with the k right

521
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,159
and then y

522
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,480
q

523
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,640
y y l q or y

524
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,880
length q equals zero it's the same yeah

525
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,440
length skill oh let's get bigger than

526
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,159
zero it's the same why kill then we want

527
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,320
first of all we need to take we can take

528
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,240
one at a time or we can take everything

529
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,000
at the time from throwing q right

530
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,840
we talked about this last lesson yeah

531
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,480
from the cube first search we can take

532
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,400
we can pop pop one at a time or we can

533
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,919
pop everything of the current elements

534
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,679
in the cube right so let's say we want

535
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,880
to take all the elements so t equals

536
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,880
length skill

537
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,039
and then now i need to take everything

538
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,320
out of q for in range

539
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,000
range t

540
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,559
and then i i want to take it out so

541
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,520
which is what current equals

542
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,840
equals what equals q so how can i take

543
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,840
it out

544
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,440
because the queue you know

545
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,679
the queue when you dq you know we know

546
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,679
when we take an animal out of you we

547
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,600
take it at the front when we put the

548
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,440
thing in the queue we put it at the end

549
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,320
which is what

550
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,960
pop left and open right way down okay

551
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,240
let's see it's taking a while taking it

552
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,400
out right

553
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,159
taking it off right so we take it now

554
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,159
then what do we do

555
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,280
so we take it out what to do then we

556
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,559
need to do a

557
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
for

558
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,679
i

559
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,039
in children yeah because we have

560
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,679
children

561
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,559
children see

562
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,840
we chosen here then we do what

563
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,880
we do what

564
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,960
we do q dot append

565
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,840
a plan i right

566
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,120
right so so in this case uh

567
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,120
q dot pen right yes

568
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,280
but we need we uh first of all we need

569
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,400
to take it and uh sorry there's a

570
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,799
problem okay

571
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,799
also

572
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,080
so we take it off we take it out and we

573
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,640
need to put it here

574
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,400
the answer needs to append uh because we

575
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,360
already taken out so we append the c

576
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,520
right

577
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,720
apprentice c and then we apply the i and

578
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,559
we 10 return the q return the answer

579
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,559
right so let's go through this again

580
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,440
answer at the beginning we we have

581
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,120
nothing to uh this is the list to store

582
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,960
the number

583
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,880
to store the notes to take out the kill

584
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,200
okay

585
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,280
yes

586
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,360
well while the queue has still has

587
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,280
element then this is the number of

588
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,400
elements in the cube then we go we need

589
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,559
to pop them out all uh at once okay and

590
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,200
then we take one out the c then we put

591
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,360
in a answer

592
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,240
when we take the cr we need to append

593
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,320
its kids right back to the queue so that

594
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,280
that's what you did for i in children

595
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,480
see

596
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,960
yeah

597
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,200
chosen here we appear here the key value

598
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,120
pairs the key is the parent the value is

599
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,360
the list of the children wrongs okay

600
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,559
then we append the i back into the queue

601
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,400
okay

602
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,440
so what's the time complexity of the

603
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,679
different station professors

604
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,679
if there are n nodes in a in a tree

605
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,320
the preference the blue force is always

606
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,159
square we talk about that because every

607
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,840
time we need to go through that thing to

608
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,840
find out

609
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,360
why is it oh n is good because we may

610
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,600
have to go through the list to find out

611
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,280
whose parents whose

612
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,480
which notes the parents has the parent

613
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,039
of them like the target right so that's

614
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,559
n times and for each node it has there

615
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,559
there and there are unknowns so there

616
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,960
will be n square but for this one we

617
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,000
already built it so we can just follow

618
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,760
this

619
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,679
what's the time to max t comma if i take

620
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,480
this out i just need to visit all these

621
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,840
ones

622
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,279
oh and what does what both are this one

623
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,279
right what's the space complexity

624
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,640
are we using any space

625
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,640
[Music]

626
