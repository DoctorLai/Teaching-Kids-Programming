1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,839
yo hello mr mr rhino you're right

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,120
yeah good okay so let's say we have a

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,840
map

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,759
we have a map and if each number is

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,960
different color right let's let's just

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,960
look at this three times three map okay

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,240
two three

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,600
three

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,960
four

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
one

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,480
one okay so there are four colors one

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,880
two three four and in one operation okay

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,599
in one operation we can change any piece

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,840
of card connected like this brilliantly

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,559
connected horizontally vertically

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,640
connected we can change any pieces of

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,480
color to one color

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,680
right i would call it as one operation

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,920
okay so the question is that

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,600
what's the minimum number operations

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,399
that we need to convert all the colors

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,480
all the numbers into one single color

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,000
anybody everybody

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,239
so in this case which color

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,079
let's see so which color would you like

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,079
to convert it to three

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,080
which color we want to keep okay so we

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,760
want one one why is that because it has

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,920
a mouse

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,119
yeah three pieces right

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,799
so we want to keep the maximum uh the

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,200
the number of the

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,280
we want to keep the

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,680
the colors that have the most pieces

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,840
right yeah okay

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
okay

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,560
i see i see yeah yeah why is that look

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,520
two two three four okay

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,520
okay let's see that's it

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,640
i'm not an

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,640
example okay

42
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,159
[Laughter]

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,159
okay

44
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,600
[Music]

45
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,000
okay so which color we want to keep

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,479
which color we want to keep come on yeah

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,560
okay we will keep

48
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,959
one

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,120
one one one one

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,239
because i have the maximum huh

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,360
which column one one you say one what

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,360
will be you

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,360
because you have the most mickey

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,360
come on

55
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,879
we can count how many one one how many

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,040
pieces five

57
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,440
no no no this is one piece so

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,200
remember we can change any

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,200
one operation we can change everything

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,640
connected to another color okay so that

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,400
only two

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,160
two okay so

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
would you like to change your answer

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,280
yeah okay two how many piece how many

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,280
how many connected

66
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,000
okay that's another one yeah

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,879
three how many

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,760
three

69
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,200
one two three

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,000
four how many one

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,840
okay so which color we want to keep

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,040
which color we want to keep

73
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,760
come on easy

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,200
so you see so we can change any piece in

75
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,159
one operation we can change the

76
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,319
connected pieces to to any color we want

77
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,840
right so here

78
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,760
so which one has the largest pieces

79
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,280
so okay so

80
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
what's the answer

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,200
yeah we want to keep the three right

82
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,200
yeah so how many operations do we need

83
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,360
how many operations do we need come on

84
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,680
we only keep the number three yeah yeah

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,200
so how many operations we need to

86
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,080
do we need

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,599
how many operations come on it's there

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
how many operations we need to change

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,080
all the colors to three how many how

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,319
many colors which are different than

91
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,319
three

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,200
three

93
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,120
why is it three come on here is two

94
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,360
right look these two one this is

95
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,720
separate we need two operations

96
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,200
yeah

97
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,080
okay so yeah you're quite like this one

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,959
but

99
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,120
different they are two different pieces

100
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,360
right that's why we need two operations

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,000
so two plus one plus one

102
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,959
four operation

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,799
yeah

104
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,840
okay so what's the how do we do it look

105
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,519
we can

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,799
i think he

107
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
fish

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
yeah

109
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,280
you cannot drink this problem now yeah

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,040
you switch these to two

111
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,519
and then you switch this to three and

112
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,880
then you see all of this two three and

113
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,040
then that oh okay

114
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,639
that's very good but

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,240
that's different problem okay we are not

116
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,960
talking about that complex but you are

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,520
quite creative i i know what you mean

118
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,600
once the color is changed it's changed

119
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,440
it cannot be changed again

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,680
so you're saying that change leads to

121
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,040
two and then do this whole thing to

122
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,199
three right

123
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,600
yeah but we are not doing that okay

124
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,840
yeah now i see why you get a number yeah

125
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,199
that's very clear okay so i have to

126
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,600
point out that

127
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,160
a color can only be changed at most once

128
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,160
so we just change any colors to to

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,120
another color so

130
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,440
so yeah in this case we just find out

131
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,240
the maximum not pieces and we want to

132
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,440
keep it right and the rest the sum of

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,199
the rest

134
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,680
some of the rest will be the number of

135
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,560
operations we need yeah do you get it

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,080
yeah yeah okay so look how do we do this

137
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,160
remember we talked about the island yeah

138
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,560
we counted our number of islands right

139
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,800
so we just go through these

140
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,600
and then we just mark

141
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
using mercury neighbor neighbor which is

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,280
vertical

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,520
vertical come on come on listen to me

144
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,919
vertical lens vertical or horizontal

145
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,840
connected pieces we let's look how do we

146
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,600
do it do we have elephants other colors

147
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,280
yeah can i have it do you have red

148
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,440
okay okay

149
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,440
how how do we do this look at this map

150
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,320
so it goes to two

151
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,680
yeah

152
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,960
so two

153
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,360
mix colors up two okay so what do we do

154
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,680
two we just change the connected pieces

155
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,080
to minus one okay minus one minus one

156
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,759
minus one minus one so two

157
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,600
let's

158
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,720
put it a one right because we have put

159
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,639
we have counted one piece of length

160
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,800
colors which is one right okay three

161
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,160
look three connect it

162
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,440
make it minus one three one four

163
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,840
connect it

164
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,639
minus one minus one minus one minus one

165
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,520
four

166
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,520
one okay this is minus one i skip one

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,240
one okay minus one okay skip my three

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,319
three here look three here one man

169
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,720
um

170
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,360
i put in minus one yeah i have to

171
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,280
increment one so that would be two yeah

172
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,759
one

173
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,440
minus one minus one minus one minus one

174
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,319
yeah

175
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,600
two okay three

176
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
minus one

177
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,560
i i increment three okay

178
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,720
okay so which one is the largest three

179
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,639
we keep this all the rest one plus one

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,360
plus two is the number operation we need

181
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,319
because look there are four colors you

182
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,319
need to change to

183
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
let let's just just i don't want to go

184
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,479
here okay yeah

185
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,479
okay

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,120
okay look it says the peppa pig

187
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,919
oh that's a big man

188
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,440
yeah

189
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,759
okay

190
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,120
that first search

191
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,960
rc color color let's say color okay

192
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,280
color

193
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,400
so if

194
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,680
okay r smaller than zero or c smaller

195
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,199
than zero or ah bigger or equal than

196
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,520
rows

197
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,840
the number of rows on the map or c

198
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,840
bigger or equal than columns

199
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,479
along with 10 okay

200
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,080
okay then we check if the map

201
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,639
even a map map rc

202
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,720
it's not equal a color then we

203
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,199
this is not a connected pieces or it has

204
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,840
been visited then we do 10 okay

205
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,319
and then we just we have to mark it as

206
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,879
visiting let's mark it as -1 okay so we

207
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,560
visited it remember yeah yeah

208
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,000
and then we just have to go for four

209
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,800
directions which are the four directions

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,560
no i'm a current rc so which are the

211
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,639
four positions

212
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,240
here here here here right cfs r minus

213
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,639
one c

214
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,639
color

215
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,479
r plus one c color right go for four

216
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,680
direction all right can you can you tell

217
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,200
me what's the

218
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,519
next two

219
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,640
huh this is yours

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,200
okay r minus one is here alpha last one

221
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,200
is here so what what's here

222
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,519
ah c one

223
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,440
rc plus one where that and then what's

224
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,600
the here

225
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,760
where's that

226
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
okay so in this case we use surfaces to

227
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,200
visit the map okay

228
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
and then we from

229
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,279
the front

230
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,240
so this is separate

231
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,800
i just need a little fuel space okay

232
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,519
so let's take put a color in

233
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,720
additionally before

234
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,600
decisionary which has the internet this

235
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,160
this data structure dictionary is to use

236
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,000
to count the number the colors the key

237
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,160
will be the colors the value will be the

238
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,760
number of pieces right the number of

239
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,360
connected lens for r in

240
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,720
range

241
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,800
rows

242
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,560
for c in range columns yeah

243
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,519
and then if

244
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,519
map rc not equal minus one because if

245
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,959
it's minus one then it's being visited

246
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,600
then we have to

247
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,959
uh the color color will be

248
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,000
the x x will be mac

249
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,880
r c okay and then we have to define

250
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,959
search r c x

251
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,959
and then theta

252
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:07,360
theta x plus equals one right yeah

253
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,760
now first of all we mark the connected

254
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
pieces to minus one right

255
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,279
you know

256
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,279
and then we do like that for such uh

257
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,839
mark and then we

258
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,800
we increment the counter for the color x

259
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,360
right

260
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,560
so we can what do we pretend if we do

261
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,399
this through this step search yeah we go

262
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,600
to the map

263
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,000
pixel by pixel if it's not marked by -1

264
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,560
what does it mean it's it's a color we

265
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,480
have to trade we have to do a definition

266
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,040
and we match the color to one right

267
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,720
okay now we need to return

268
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,680
return sum of the data values so this is

269
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,480
the

270
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,920
data the value minus sum

271
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,760
minus max yeah we want to max these yeah

272
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,800
there is a value okay what does it mean

273
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
okay

274
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,519
okay so

275
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,720
remember before

276
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:04,079
before yeah before that yeah

277
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,839
one two two

278
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,120
two i don't know three four okay four no

279
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,800
one okay

280
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
so we also keep

281
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,800
look we want to keep the count of three

282
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,279
right yeah yeah

283
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,880
so how many operations do we need

284
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,160
from this decision right how many

285
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,839
operations we want to keep the current

286
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,720
three how many operations do we need

287
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,720
four

288
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,880
two plus two plus

289
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,440
five how how do we get five

290
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,480
we can do this sum 2 plus 2 plus 4 plus

291
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,760
1 let's sum of values yeah that would be

292
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,120
9 right

293
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,240
minus 4 right that's the maximum right

294
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,519
minus 4 that would be 5. do you get it

295
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,760
yeah some of these that's the number

296
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,519
total number of connected pieces of

297
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,720
thing all the colors

298
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,200
minus

299
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,200
the biggest one

300
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,160
color three is the number of

301
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,160
the maximum number of the colors that we

302
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,959
want to keep and then all the rest needs

303
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,560
to be

304
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,880
converted right

305
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,240
so we this one we are using the texture

306
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,040
search right

307
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,720
can we use the process

308
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,200
yeah yeah you can also use the

309
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,200
preferences

310
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,380
[Music]

311
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,760
in a map that's because because

312
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,440
because

313
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,839
because each look here each pixel

314
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,800
is only visited once yeah because when

315
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,600
we

316
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,079
mark the connected color

317
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,399
we mark it as minus one so it can only

318
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,760
be vegetated once so that time conductor

319
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,839
is always space for maxi

320
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,880
we're using this data right

321
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,760
suppose the data the mac has

322
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,680
has uh unique colors right each each

323
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,320
pixel will be different color then data

324
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,079
will be on right do you get it

325
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,360
okay nobody

326
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,880
will be say bye bye to people bye

327
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,800
bye bye

328
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,800
bye all right

329
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,800
bye
