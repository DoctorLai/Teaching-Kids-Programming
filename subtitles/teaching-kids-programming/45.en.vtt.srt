00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359

 

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,070

so remember what is a calendar

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080

 

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,510

with a spellback

14
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:29,520
with a spellback

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,590

okay like the race car so today we

18
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
okay like the race car so today we
 

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,310
okay like the race car so today we
talked about

20
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
talked about
 

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,549
talked about
uh interesting problem which is

22
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
uh interesting problem which is
 

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,510
uh interesting problem which is
paddington permutation

24
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
paddington permutation
 

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,790
paddington permutation
permutation permutation

26
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
permutation permutation
 

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,029
permutation permutation
exactly different ways of

28
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039

 

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,029

to organize the for example like uh

30
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
to organize the for example like uh
 

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,750
to organize the for example like uh
one two three different the permutation

32
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
one two three different the permutation
 

33
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,229
one two three different the permutation
will be

34
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
will be
 

35
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,270
will be
one three two right

36
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
one three two right
 

37
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,270
one three two right
and two one three two three one two

38
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
and two one three two three one two
 

39
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,670
and two one three two three one two
and three one two three two one so

40
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
and three one two three two one so
 

41
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,750
and three one two three two one so
basically different

42
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
basically different
 

43
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,469
basically different
possible sequence of using these three

44
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
possible sequence of using these three
 

45
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,070
possible sequence of using these three
one two three right one two three one

46
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
one two three right one two three one
 

47
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,270
one two three right one two three one
two left six right

48
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
two left six right
 

49
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,990
two left six right
remember how many how many permutations

50
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
remember how many how many permutations
 

51
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,109
remember how many how many permutations
if there are three

52
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
if there are three
 

53
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,550
if there are three
three characters that will be three

54
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
three characters that will be three
 

55
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,270
three characters that will be three
bacteria because the first

56
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
bacteria because the first
 

57
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,590
bacteria because the first
first place you can play three times

58
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
first place you can play three times
 

59
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,429
first place you can play three times
three possible yeah and then the second

60
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
three possible yeah and then the second
 

61
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,190
three possible yeah and then the second
you have two choice at the third you

62
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
you have two choice at the third you
 

63
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,710
you have two choice at the third you
have one choice three times two times

64
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
have one choice three times two times
 

65
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,109
have one choice three times two times
one

66
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
one
 

67
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,510
one
got it permutation yeah so

68
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
got it permutation yeah so
 

69
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,870
got it permutation yeah so
so given a string like

70
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
so given a string like
 

71
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,149
so given a string like
given i'm giving a string like a

72
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
given i'm giving a string like a
 

73
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,910
given i'm giving a string like a
a c c e r

74
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
a c c e r
 

75
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,429
a c c e r
okay this one can you tell me if you can

76
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
okay this one can you tell me if you can
 

77
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,310
okay this one can you tell me if you can
make a pairing drum using this camera

78
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
make a pairing drum using this camera
 

79
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,350
make a pairing drum using this camera
yeah you can yeah

80
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
yeah you can yeah
 

81
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,040
yeah you can yeah
yeah so how do you know it's possible

82
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,050

 

83
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:07,429

85
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,430

so how can we know that if given a list

86
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
so how can we know that if given a list
 

87
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,630
so how can we know that if given a list
of the

88
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
of the
 

89
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,390
of the
uh given a list of the a string

90
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
uh given a list of the a string
 

91
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,710
uh given a list of the a string
using the characters only the characters

92
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
using the characters only the characters
 

93
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,430
using the characters only the characters
in the string

94
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
in the string
 

95
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,150
in the string
how can we know we can make a parameter

96
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
how can we know we can make a parameter
 

97
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,869
how can we know we can make a parameter
by any

98
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
by any
 

99
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,229
by any
sequence subsequent unfamiliar

100
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
sequence subsequent unfamiliar
 

101
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,030
sequence subsequent unfamiliar
permutation of these because

102
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
permutation of these because
 

103
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,030
permutation of these because
you can't do one of the beginning one at

104
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
you can't do one of the beginning one at
 

105
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,270
you can't do one of the beginning one at
the end without the odd number so this

106
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
the end without the odd number so this
 

107
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,670
the end without the odd number so this
one needs to go in the midwest

108
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
one needs to go in the midwest
 

109
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,150
one needs to go in the midwest
apparently yeah very close yeah

110
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
apparently yeah very close yeah
 

111
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:48,949
apparently yeah very close yeah
apparently

00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959

 

113
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,710

like look this one rey

114
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
like look this one rey
 

115
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,750
like look this one rey
ska you have one only one character

116
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
ska you have one only one character
 

117
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,229
ska you have one only one character
which is

118
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
which is
 

119
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,030
which is
in the middle right yeah or you can have

120
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,040
in the middle right yeah or you can have
 

121
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,830
in the middle right yeah or you can have
something like

122
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
something like
 

123
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,270
something like
a abba right

124
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
a abba right
 

125
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,430
a abba right
this there are two types of parents one

126
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
this there are two types of parents one
 

127
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,550
this there are two types of parents one
is this you have this

128
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
is this you have this
 

129
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,309
is this you have this
odd number or even or even the

130
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
odd number or even or even the
 

131
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,790
odd number or even or even the
odd number of characters which means the

132
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
odd number of characters which means the
 

133
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,910
odd number of characters which means the
middle middle one

134
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
middle middle one
 

135
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,790
middle middle one
is only the one which is unique right

136
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
is only the one which is unique right
 

137
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,030
is only the one which is unique right
not

138
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040

 

139
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,190

you have even numbers but it's not

140
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
you have even numbers but it's not
 

141
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,550
you have even numbers but it's not
middle numbers yeah

142
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
middle numbers yeah
 

143
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,350
middle numbers yeah
this is two two possibilities so in both

144
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
this is two two possibilities so in both
 

145
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,869
this is two two possibilities so in both
cases

146
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
cases
 

147
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,910
cases
every characters every character needs

148
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
every characters every character needs
 

149
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,350
every characters every character needs
to appear

150
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
to appear
 

151
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,750
to appear
of even number of times except you can

152
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
of even number of times except you can
 

153
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,949
of even number of times except you can
have only one

154
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
have only one
 

155
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,949
have only one
one yeah only one which is odd number

156
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
one yeah only one which is odd number
 

157
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,910
one yeah only one which is odd number
right if i i do this for another one

158
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
right if i i do this for another one
 

159
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,630
right if i i do this for another one
okay

160
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
okay
 

161
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,630
okay
like palindrome and

162
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
like palindrome and
 

163
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,710
like palindrome and
o and o

164
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
o and o
 

165
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,270
o and o
b a can you make a parent using these

166
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
b a can you make a parent using these
 

167
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,589
b a can you make a parent using these
characters

168
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
characters
 

169
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,149
characters
no why why is that

170
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159

 

171
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,509

because yeah

172
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
because yeah
 

173
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,550
because yeah
so how about one can you make it

174
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
so how about one can you make it
 

175
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,869
so how about one can you make it
uh yeah yeah because you can do this and

176
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879

 

177
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,869

you can put it at least in the middle

178
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
you can put it at least in the middle
 

179
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,910
you can put it at least in the middle
right

180
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
right
 

181
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,949
right
yeah okay so okay so that's that's good

182
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
yeah okay so okay so that's that's good
 

183
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,390
yeah okay so okay so that's that's good
you get this okay so what's the a uh

184
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
you get this okay so what's the a uh
 

185
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,790
you get this okay so what's the a uh
let me let me just try this problem okay

186
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
let me let me just try this problem okay
 

187
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,830
let me let me just try this problem okay
look

188
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
look
 

189
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:41,590
look
defy hey

190
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600

 

191
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,030

equals counter counter

192
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
equals counter counter
 

193
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,990
equals counter counter
and then we turn this s into a list

194
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
and then we turn this s into a list
 

195
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,629
and then we turn this s into a list
string

196
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
string
 

197
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,909
string
s right now y after this we have the

198
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
s right now y after this we have the
 

199
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,670
s right now y after this we have the
dictionary which you have different

200
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
dictionary which you have different
 

201
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,550
dictionary which you have different
numbers

202
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
numbers
 

203
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,430
numbers
different account right like that yeah

204
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
different account right like that yeah
 

205
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,550
different account right like that yeah
different account

206
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
different account
 

207
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,270
different account
different accounts okay then i just need

208
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
different accounts okay then i just need
 

209
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,430
different accounts okay then i just need
to do these four

210
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
to do these four
 

211
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,189
to do these four
um i i need another number

212
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
um i i need another number
 

213
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,870
um i i need another number
count or count okay odd count

214
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
count or count okay odd count
 

215
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,909
count or count okay odd count
equals zero right what we are interested

216
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
equals zero right what we are interested
 

217
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,230
equals zero right what we are interested
in

218
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
in
 

219
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,870
in
is in account if it's more than one it's

220
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
is in account if it's more than one it's
 

221
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,510
is in account if it's more than one it's
definitely

222
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
definitely
 

223
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,270
definitely
not possible so look for i

224
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
not possible so look for i
 

225
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,710
not possible so look for i
in d dot

226
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
in d dot
 

227
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,070
in d dot
keys remember d dot keys is the

228
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
keys remember d dot keys is the
 

229
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,670
keys remember d dot keys is the
e is least the characters yeah

230
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
e is least the characters yeah
 

231
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,110
e is least the characters yeah
characters in the string column

232
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
characters in the string column
 

233
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,029
characters in the string column
if d i

234
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
if d i
 

235
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,150
if d i
is this the pure number of times yes

236
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
is this the pure number of times yes
 

237
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,469
is this the pure number of times yes
yeah if it's odd we can do this modulus

238
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
yeah if it's odd we can do this modulus
 

239
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,670
yeah if it's odd we can do this modulus
too right

240
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
too right
 

241
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,710
too right
yes or modulus two equals one right we

242
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
yes or modulus two equals one right we
 

243
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,710
yes or modulus two equals one right we
can do this yes

244
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
can do this yes
 

245
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,790
can do this yes
remember an integer or remember the

246
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
remember an integer or remember the
 

247
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,950
remember an integer or remember the
binary yeah binary like three

248
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
binary yeah binary like three
 

249
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,029
binary yeah binary like three
three the binary is one zero

250
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
three the binary is one zero
 

251
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,350
three the binary is one zero
one one right this is three in binary

252
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
one one right this is three in binary
 

253
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,070
one one right this is three in binary
right

254
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
right
 

255
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,749
right
remember two in binary is one zero yeah

256
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
remember two in binary is one zero yeah
 

257
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,230
remember two in binary is one zero yeah
four in binaries is one zero zero right

258
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
four in binaries is one zero zero right
 

259
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,070
four in binaries is one zero zero right
one in binary is zero

260
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
one in binary is zero
 

261
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,749
one in binary is zero
one yeah so in finally

262
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
one yeah so in finally
 

263
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,390
one yeah so in finally
if the last digit is one then it's odd

264
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
if the last digit is one then it's odd
 

265
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,870
if the last digit is one then it's odd
number

266
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
number
 

267
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,430
number
right if it's zero it's even number

268
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
right if it's zero it's even number
 

269
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,150
right if it's zero it's even number
right

270
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
right
 

271
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,270
right
yeah so we can use this binary end the

272
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
yeah so we can use this binary end the
 

273
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,469
yeah so we can use this binary end the
same as this

274
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
same as this
 

275
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,430
same as this
so if t i modular two equals one is the

276
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
so if t i modular two equals one is the
 

277
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,390
so if t i modular two equals one is the
same as

278
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
same as
 

279
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,469
same as
if d i n one

280
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
if d i n one
 

281
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,710
if d i n one
and one means like to the end on the

282
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
and one means like to the end on the
 

283
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,309
and one means like to the end on the
last bit if it's one

284
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
last bit if it's one
 

285
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,309
last bit if it's one
then it's the old number then i want to

286
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
then it's the old number then i want to
 

287
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,070
then it's the old number then i want to
list odd

288
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
list odd
 

289
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,830
list odd
count plus equals one right

290
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
count plus equals one right
 

291
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,270
count plus equals one right
yes

292
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280

 

293
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,029

bigger than one one what do we do here

294
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
bigger than one one what do we do here
 

295
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,390
bigger than one one what do we do here
return

296
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400

 

297
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,909

two of us if it's more than if there's

298
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
two of us if it's more than if there's
 

299
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,670
two of us if it's more than if there's
more than one odd number what

300
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
more than one odd number what
 

301
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,990
more than one odd number what
four yes the next one must be true

302
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
four yes the next one must be true
 

303
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,670
four yes the next one must be true
yes and then what's your happen here

304
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
yes and then what's your happen here
 

305
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:20,309
yes and then what's your happen here
after this

306
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319

 

307
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,189

all right what's the space complexity

308
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
all right what's the space complexity
 

309
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,950
all right what's the space complexity
yes because we're using this counter

310
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
yes because we're using this counter
 

311
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,870
yes because we're using this counter
yeah this is basically

312
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
yeah this is basically
 

313
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,790
yeah this is basically
uh if we are not using this counter

314
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
uh if we are not using this counter
 

315
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,270
uh if we are not using this counter
object

316
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
object
 

317
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,710
object
even how can we do this we can use

318
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
even how can we do this we can use
 

319
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,150
even how can we do this we can use
we can use what if we

320
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
we can use what if we
 

321
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,990
we can use what if we
if we are not using this counter we can

322
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
if we are not using this counter we can
 

323
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,589
if we are not using this counter we can
do this

324
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
do this
 

325
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:51,830
do this
we can do this

326
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840

 

327
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,189

default dictionary yeah which is called

328
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
default dictionary yeah which is called
 

329
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,990
default dictionary yeah which is called
and the type is integer then we can do

330
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
and the type is integer then we can do
 

331
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,830
and the type is integer then we can do
this

332
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
this
 

333
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,430
this
for i in s right

334
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
for i in s right
 

335
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,990
for i in s right
i n x now i can just put b

336
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
i n x now i can just put b
 

337
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,589
i n x now i can just put b
string d i plus equals one right

338
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
string d i plus equals one right
 

339
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,110
string d i plus equals one right
yeah okay then after this

340
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
yeah okay then after this
 

341
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,790
yeah okay then after this
do this counting and then we do this the

342
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
do this counting and then we do this the
 

343
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,790
do this counting and then we do this the

counter object check two okay
 

487
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,389
counter object check two okay
let's do this check two thing

488
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:16,399
let's do this check two thing
 

489
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,389
let's do this check two thing
check two things and then we have a

490
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
check two things and then we have a
 

491
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,990
check two things and then we have a
dictionary right

492
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
dictionary right
 

493
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,069
dictionary right
yeah and we have additional this is two

494
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
yeah and we have additional this is two
 

495
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,550
yeah and we have additional this is two
additional but we now we have to

496
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
additional but we now we have to
 

497
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,750
additional but we now we have to
in s right and every time if i

498
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
in s right and every time if i
 

499
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,269
in s right and every time if i
in d then we do this as uh

500
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
in d then we do this as uh
 

501
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,389
in d then we do this as uh
d i plus equals one as if it's not

502
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
d i plus equals one as if it's not
 

503
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,269
d i plus equals one as if it's not
in then we set it to one right and then

504
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
in then we set it to one right and then
 

505
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:37,990
in then we set it to one right and then
after this

506
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
after this
 

507
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,110
after this
you can copy from the uh form i in

508
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
you can copy from the uh form i in
 

509
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,350
you can copy from the uh form i in
d this is d dot keys this is the same

510
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
d this is d dot keys this is the same
 

511
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,829
d this is d dot keys this is the same
right if d i and one you can also do

512
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
right if d i and one you can also do
 

513
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,030
right if d i and one you can also do
this modular two

514
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
this modular two
 

515
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,590
this modular two
equals one it means that it's even on

516
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
equals one it means that it's even on
 

517
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,230
equals one it means that it's even on
bottom

518
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
bottom
 

519
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,509
bottom
and all the time

520
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519

 

521
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,030

which one looks a bit weird

522
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
which one looks a bit weird
 

523
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,230
which one looks a bit weird
looks a bit weird it's a bit blurry

524
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
looks a bit weird it's a bit blurry
 

525
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,310
looks a bit weird it's a bit blurry

oh you need no people yeah wait wait
 

527
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,069
oh you need no people yeah wait wait
wait let me try let me check this if

528
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
wait let me try let me check this if
 

529
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,509
wait let me try let me check this if
it's uh

530
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
it's uh
 

531
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,949
it's uh
if it's all right oh come on

532
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
if it's all right oh come on
 

533
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,990
if it's all right oh come on
yeah let's try if it's all right

534
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
yeah let's try if it's all right
 

535
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,670
yeah let's try if it's all right
yeah it's the same look it's the same

536
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
yeah it's the same look it's the same
 

537
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,590
yeah it's the same look it's the same
yeah it's the same

538
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
yeah it's the same
 

539
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,509
yeah it's the same
so both both are fine if you're using

540
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
so both both are fine if you're using
 

541
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,509
so both both are fine if you're using
the dictionary you can do this in the

542
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
the dictionary you can do this in the
 

543
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,030
the dictionary you can do this in the
beginning but

544
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
beginning but
 

545
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,310
beginning but
in the line line six in a line

546
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
in the line line six in a line
 

547
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,870
in the line line six in a line
six is basically the same as from nine

548
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
six is basically the same as from nine
 

549
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,829
six is basically the same as from nine
sixteen to

550
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
sixteen to
 

551
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,949
sixteen to
twenty one okay line six this line

552
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
twenty one okay line six this line
 

553
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,550
twenty one okay line six this line
is basically the same as from 9 16 to 21

554
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560
is basically the same as from 9 16 to 21
 

555
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,030
is basically the same as from 9 16 to 21
which is the you see numbers so this

556
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
which is the you see numbers so this
 

557
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,910
which is the you see numbers so this
version is much

558
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:41,920
version is much
 

559
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,150
version is much
simpler much easier to use we are just

560
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160
simpler much easier to use we are just
 

561
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,030
simpler much easier to use we are just
