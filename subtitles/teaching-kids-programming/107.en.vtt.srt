good
 

7
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,030
good
good so remember a few months ago we

8
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
good so remember a few months ago we
 

9
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,990
good so remember a few months ago we
talked about

10
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
talked about
 

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,150
talked about
you know i talked about this these

12
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
you know i talked about this these
 

13
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,070
you know i talked about this these
number of perfect squares

14
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
number of perfect squares
 

15
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,269
number of perfect squares
for example 12 if you if you want to

16
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
for example 12 if you if you want to
 

17
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,830
for example 12 if you if you want to
represent 12 in the sum of perfect

18
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
represent 12 in the sum of perfect
 

19
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,470
represent 12 in the sum of perfect
squares

20
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
squares
 

21
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,630
squares
what would you represent it equals

22
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
what would you represent it equals
 

23
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,349
what would you represent it equals
4 plus 4 plus 4 right because this is

24
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
4 plus 4 plus 4 right because this is
 

25
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,230
4 plus 4 plus 4 right because this is
the perfect square

26
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
the perfect square
 

27
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,190
the perfect square
yeah and thirteen equals one thirteen

28
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,200
yeah and thirteen equals one thirteen
 

29
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,990
yeah and thirteen equals one thirteen
equals one

30
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
equals one
 

31
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,190
equals one
can you pretend yeah

32
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
can you pretend yeah
 

33
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,270
can you pretend yeah
keep going yeah you're all right yeah

34
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
keep going yeah you're all right yeah
 

35
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,229
keep going yeah you're all right yeah
four four

36
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:40,239
four four
 

37
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,910
four four
plus one nine yeah look a perfect square

38
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
plus one nine yeah look a perfect square
 

39
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,270
plus one nine yeah look a perfect square
yeah

40
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
yeah
 

41
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,430
yeah
square these are perfect square yeah i

42
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
square these are perfect square yeah i
 

43
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,190
square these are perfect square yeah i
know perfect square so these

44
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
know perfect square so these
 

45
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,310
know perfect square so these
need two least needs three number yeah

46
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
need two least needs three number yeah
 

47
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,590
need two least needs three number yeah
correct least yeah of course if you if

48
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
correct least yeah of course if you if
 

49
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,790
correct least yeah of course if you if
you know the least

50
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800

 

51
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,630

yeah yeah like if it's not if you want

52
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
yeah yeah like if it's not if you want
 

53
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,310
yeah yeah like if it's not if you want
to the most right

54
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
to the most right
 

55
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,870
to the most right
then 13 would be one plus one plus one

56
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
then 13 would be one plus one plus one
 

57
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,630
then 13 would be one plus one plus one
yeah level 13 because one is the total

58
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
yeah level 13 because one is the total
 

59
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,590
yeah level 13 because one is the total
number

60
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
number
 

61
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,070
number
perfect square number so our task is

62
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
perfect square number so our task is
 

63
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,149
perfect square number so our task is
given a number like 13 you need to tell

64
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
given a number like 13 you need to tell
 

65
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:14,710
given a number like 13 you need to tell
me that

66
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
me that
 

67
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,510
me that
you need a two right and if it is twelve

68
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
you need a two right and if it is twelve
 

69
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,149
you need a two right and if it is twelve
we need to tell

70
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
we need to tell
 

71
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,510
we need to tell
me three for me you need two yeah uh why

72
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
me three for me you need two yeah uh why
 

73
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,070
me three for me you need two yeah uh why
yeah yeah yeah for six what's six later

74
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
yeah yeah yeah for six what's six later
 

75
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,350
yeah yeah yeah for six what's six later
on six one

76
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
on six one
 

77
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,390
on six one
six

78
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400

 

79
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,390

six four one one well done four one one

80
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
six four one one well done four one one
 

81
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,109
six four one one well done four one one
yes and

82
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
yes and
 

83
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:49,190
yes and
how about how about seven

84
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200

 

85
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,670

no two is not perfect square number four

86
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
no two is not perfect square number four
 

87
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,830
no two is not perfect square number four
add one one

88
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840
add one one
 

89
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,149
add one one
one so in theory

90
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
one so in theory
 

91
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,230
one so in theory
in series okay it's a very complex

92
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
in series okay it's a very complex
 

93
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,190
in series okay it's a very complex
mathematics

94
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
mathematics
 

95
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,310
mathematics
theory in theory at most four numbers

96
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
theory in theory at most four numbers
 

97
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,389
theory in theory at most four numbers
four numbers you cannot even if you find

98
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
four numbers you cannot even if you find
 

99
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,670
four numbers you cannot even if you find
the five then

100
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
the five then
 

101
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,430
the five then
it's not optimum okay how about 23

102
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
it's not optimum okay how about 23
 

103
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,270
it's not optimum okay how about 23
23 okay so can you find 23 let's go 23

104
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280

 

105
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,790

16 plus

106
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800

 

107
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,700

plus one four plus

108
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:24,710

 

109
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:35,430

[Music]

110
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440

 

111
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,589

how about how about nine nine

112
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
how about how about nine nine
 

113
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,710
how about how about nine nine
nine nine four one

114
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
nine nine four one
 

115
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,309
nine nine four one
yeah perfect look at that four yeah

116
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
yeah perfect look at that four yeah
 

117
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,910
yeah perfect look at that four yeah
because if you're choosing 16 you can't

118
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
because if you're choosing 16 you can't
 

119
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,110
because if you're choosing 16 you can't
make it into the four

120
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
make it into the four
 

121
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,070
make it into the four
numbers yeah yeah because 16 what's left

122
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
numbers yeah yeah because 16 what's left
 

123
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,270
numbers yeah yeah because 16 what's left
seven left and then

124
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
seven left and then
 

125
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,589
seven left and then
we know seven is four plus one plus one

126
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
we know seven is four plus one plus one
 

127
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,509
we know seven is four plus one plus one
yeah so they're five well you can't

128
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
yeah so they're five well you can't
 

129
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,110
yeah so they're five well you can't
actually find four okay so this is the

130
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
actually find four okay so this is the
 

131
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,750
actually find four okay so this is the
example of this is the example of

132
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
example of this is the example of
 

133
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,190
example of this is the example of
liquidity doesn't work you know

134
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
liquidity doesn't work you know
 

135
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,309
liquidity doesn't work you know
liquidity

136
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
liquidity
 

137
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,910
liquidity
well done this is a perfect example if

138
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
well done this is a perfect example if
 

139
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,869
well done this is a perfect example if
you 23 what's the largest

140
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
you 23 what's the largest
 

141
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,949
you 23 what's the largest
perfect square number that is less than

142
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
perfect square number that is less than
 

143
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,070
perfect square number that is less than
23

144
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
23
 

145
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,949
23
16 yeah but if you pick 16 you can't

146
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
16 yeah but if you pick 16 you can't
 

147
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,949
16 yeah but if you pick 16 you can't
finish it in four numbers

148
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
finish it in four numbers
 

149
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,509
finish it in four numbers
you see so this is this is the perfect

150
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
you see so this is this is the perfect
 

151
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,149
you see so this is this is the perfect
scenario

152
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
scenario
 

153
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,390
scenario
that the greedy doesn't work the greedy

154
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
that the greedy doesn't work the greedy
 

155
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,430
that the greedy doesn't work the greedy
you know what's greedy

156
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440

 

157
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,949

yeah yeah yeah yeah 23

158
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
yeah yeah yeah yeah 23
 

159
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,990
yeah yeah yeah yeah 23
i picked the largest largest

160
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
i picked the largest largest
 

161
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,470
i picked the largest largest
number perfect square number left is

162
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
number perfect square number left is
 

163
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,589
number perfect square number left is
less than

164
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
less than
 

165
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,830
less than
23 which is 16 but if i pick a 16

166
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
23 which is 16 but if i pick a 16
 

167
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,630
23 which is 16 but if i pick a 16
i make the wrong choice because if i

168
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
i make the wrong choice because if i
 

169
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,190
i make the wrong choice because if i
take

170

using less than four less or equal of

174
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
using less than four less or equal of
 

175
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,869
using less than four less or equal of
four numbers

176
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
four numbers
 

177
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,630
four numbers
i have to pick something different which

178
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
i have to pick something different which
 

179
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,229
i have to pick something different which
is nine and nine

180
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
is nine and nine
 

181
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,509
is nine and nine
nine four one whether okay so any idea

182
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
nine four one whether okay so any idea
 

183
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,470
nine four one whether okay so any idea
how we are solving this problem

184
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
how we are solving this problem
 

185
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,789
how we are solving this problem
how are we solving this moment

186
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799

 

187
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,949

remember dynamic programming what's

188
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
remember dynamic programming what's
 

189
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,670
remember dynamic programming what's
dynamic programming

190
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
dynamic programming
 

191
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,830
dynamic programming
remembering remembering how are we

192
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
remembering remembering how are we
 

193
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,869
remembering remembering how are we
remembering

194
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
remembering
 

195
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,229
remembering
look if we are if we if we pick 16 yeah

196
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
look if we are if we if we pick 16 yeah
 

197
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,830
look if we are if we if we pick 16 yeah
yeah and what's left seven

198
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
yeah and what's left seven
 

199
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,230
yeah and what's left seven
but we already know the seven yeah yeah

200
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
but we already know the seven yeah yeah
 

201
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,870
but we already know the seven yeah yeah
we all

202
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
we all
 

203
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,790
we all
already know that seven needs the four

204
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
already know that seven needs the four
 

205
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,510
already know that seven needs the four
numbers yeah so we don't need to

206
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
numbers yeah so we don't need to
 

207
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,550
numbers yeah so we don't need to
calculate 7 again so if we can find some

208
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
calculate 7 again so if we can find some
 

209
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,590
calculate 7 again so if we can find some
way

210
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
way
 

211
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,350
way
to memorizing this thing

212
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
to memorizing this thing
 

213
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,230
to memorizing this thing
and then we can reuse it so so basically

214
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
and then we can reuse it so so basically
 

215
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,830
and then we can reuse it so so basically
if we

216
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
if we
 

217
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,430
if we
use the if we use the function f n

218
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
use the if we use the function f n
 

219
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,390
use the if we use the function f n
to represent the length the number of

220
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
to represent the length the number of
 

221
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,670
to represent the length the number of
the perfect squares

222
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
the perfect squares
 

223
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,430
the perfect squares
that can be sum up to n yeah yeah

224
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
that can be sum up to n yeah yeah
 

225
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,670
that can be sum up to n yeah yeah
so f n equals to mean

226
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
so f n equals to mean
 

227
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,510
so f n equals to mean
f n and we are choosing the minimum yeah

228
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
f n and we are choosing the minimum yeah
 

229
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,430
f n and we are choosing the minimum yeah
choosing what so f yeah

230
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
choosing what so f yeah
 

231
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,870
choosing what so f yeah
f n minus

232
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
f n minus
 

233
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,390
f n minus
j times j

234
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
j times j
 

235
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,430
j times j
yeah yeah plus one right

236
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
yeah yeah plus one right
 

237
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,909
yeah yeah plus one right
and it's j this needs to be bigger than

238
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
and it's j this needs to be bigger than
 

239
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,189
and it's j this needs to be bigger than
zero right

240
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
zero right
 

241
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,830
zero right
all right so look if we can find a way

242
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
all right so look if we can find a way
 

243
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,710
all right so look if we can find a way
to iterate

244
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
to iterate
 

245
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,950
to iterate
all the numbers and then we can update

246
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
all the numbers and then we can update
 

247
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,150
all the numbers and then we can update
these right together

248
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
these right together
 

249
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,189
these right together
look j we just need to iterate

250
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
look j we just need to iterate
 

251
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,550
look j we just need to iterate
j between between one between

252
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
j between between one between
 

253
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,749
j between between one between
one two square root of n

254
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
one two square root of n
 

255
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,189
one two square root of n
right yeah now we need to find out

256
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
right yeah now we need to find out
 

257
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,670
right yeah now we need to find out
this f n look this is f and it's a sub

258
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
this f n look this is f and it's a sub
 

259
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,310
this f n look this is f and it's a sub
problem

260
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
problem
 

261
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,310
problem
a smaller problem yeah look if this is

262
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
a smaller problem yeah look if this is
 

263
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,990
a smaller problem yeah look if this is
23 yeah look f1 23

264
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
23 yeah look f1 23
 

265
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,629
23 yeah look f1 23
and then if j equals three

266
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
and then if j equals three
 

267
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,670
and then if j equals three
uh four right four and then j equals

268
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
uh four right four and then j equals
 

269
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,309
uh four right four and then j equals
four and

270
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
four and
 

271
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,029
four and
four times four is sixteen right twenty

272
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
four times four is sixteen right twenty
 

273
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,790
four times four is sixteen right twenty
three minus sixteen is seven

274
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
three minus sixteen is seven
 

275
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,230
three minus sixteen is seven
yeah so basically f 23 equals

276
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
yeah so basically f 23 equals
 

277
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,749
yeah so basically f 23 equals
mean this is just an example f 23

278
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
mean this is just an example f 23
 

279
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,029
mean this is just an example f 23
we we keep updating the f 23 with the

280
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
we we keep updating the f 23 with the
 

281
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,790
we we keep updating the f 23 with the
with the smaller number f 1

282
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
with the smaller number f 1
 

283
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,990
with the smaller number f 1
f 23 minus four times four right this is

284
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
f 23 minus four times four right this is
 

285
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,029
f 23 minus four times four right this is
f7 right

286
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
f7 right
 

287
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,830
f7 right
yes yeah i need to plus one right do you

288
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
yes yeah i need to plus one right do you
 

289
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,029
yes yeah i need to plus one right do you
know why why we need to plus one here

290
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039

 

291
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,029

look f7 let's say

292
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
look f7 let's say
 

293
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,950
look f7 let's say
f7 we know four numbers yeah right

294
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
f7 we know four numbers yeah right
 

295
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,710
f7 we know four numbers yeah right
f7 we know four numbers four numbers yes

296
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
f7 we know four numbers four numbers yes
 

297
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,830
f7 we know four numbers four numbers yes
i'm right

298
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
i'm right
 

299
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,590
i'm right
and then

300
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600

 

301
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,950

7 plus 4 times 4 equals

302
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
7 plus 4 times 4 equals
 

303
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,469
7 plus 4 times 4 equals
23 yeah f7

304
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
23 yeah f7
 

305
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,189
23 yeah f7
now f7 is 4 numbers

306
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
now f7 is 4 numbers
 

307
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,749
now f7 is 4 numbers
4 numbers plus a perfect square number

308
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
4 numbers plus a perfect square number
 

309
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,350
4 numbers plus a perfect square number
equals 23. so the 23 is the four numbers

310
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
equals 23. so the 23 is the four numbers
 

311
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,230
equals 23. so the 23 is the four numbers
plus one number all right yes you get it

312
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
plus one number all right yes you get it
 

313
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,430
plus one number all right yes you get it
here

314
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
here
 

315
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,430
here
okay so look 23 minus four times four

316
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
okay so look 23 minus four times four
 

317
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,270
okay so look 23 minus four times four
this is the perfect square 16 we are

318
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
this is the perfect square 16 we are
 

319
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,469
this is the perfect square 16 we are
talking about

320
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
talking about
 

321
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,309
talking about
right and we we know this is f7 this is

322
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
right and we we know this is f7 this is
 

323
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,749
right and we we know this is f7 this is
four numbers

324
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
four numbers
 

325
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,189
four numbers
and now we are mine we are

326
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
and now we are mine we are
 

327
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,230
and now we are mine we are
deducting a perfect square which is 14

328
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
deducting a perfect square which is 14
 

329
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,790
deducting a perfect square which is 14
as

330
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
as
 

331
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,830
as
16 here so it means that we have

332
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
16 here so it means that we have
 

333
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,230
16 here so it means that we have
one more extra number to add right to

334
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
one more extra number to add right to
 

335
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,830
one more extra number to add right to
update am i

336
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
update am i
 

337
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,710
update am i
okay so if we check all the

338
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
okay so if we check all the
 

339
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,589
okay so if we check all the
possibilities

340
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
possibilities
 

341
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,790
possibilities
between i and square number of n

342
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
between i and square number of n
 

343
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,309
between i and square number of n
then we find the answer all right

344
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
then we find the answer all right
 

345
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,469
then we find the answer all right
okay so let's write it and how many

346
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
okay so let's write it and how many
 

347
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,390
okay so let's write it and how many
dynamic programming are we talking about

348
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
dynamic programming are we talking about
 

349
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,029
dynamic programming are we talking about
do you know how many kinds of dynamic

350
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
do you know how many kinds of dynamic
 

351
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,629
do you know how many kinds of dynamic
programming

352
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
programming
 

353
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,550
programming
how many kinds of dynamic programming

354
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560

 

355
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,150

and what's this minimalization what's

356
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
and what's this minimalization what's
 

357
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,270
and what's this minimalization what's
that memory minimalization location with

358
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
that memory minimalization location with
 

359
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,469
that memory minimalization location with
the minimum migration

360
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
the minimum migration
 

361
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,830
the minimum migration
what do you call it is it a drop down

362
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
what do you call it is it a drop down
 

363
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,629
what do you call it is it a drop down
button

364
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
button
 

365
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,110
button
yeah you see the topper of water top

366
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
yeah you see the topper of water top
 

367
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,670
yeah you see the topper of water top
down

368
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
down
 

369
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,670
down
drop down yeah minimization we use

370
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
drop down yeah minimization we use
 

371
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,670
drop down yeah minimization we use
recursion is top down because

372
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
recursion is top down because
 

373
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,869
recursion is top down because
if we want to calculate fn yeah we are

374
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
if we want to calculate fn yeah we are
 

375
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,350
if we want to calculate fn yeah we are
solving it into a smaller problem right

376
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
solving it into a smaller problem right
 

377
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,309
solving it into a smaller problem right
and we remember it yeah like a fibonacci

378
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
and we remember it yeah like a fibonacci
 

379
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,230
and we remember it yeah like a fibonacci
number if we want to calculate fn

380
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
number if we want to calculate fn
 

381
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,629
number if we want to calculate fn
we need to calculate fn minus one and f

382
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
we need to calculate fn minus one and f
 

383
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,230
we need to calculate fn minus one and f
of n minus two right

384
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
of n minus two right
 

385
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,310
of n minus two right
remember the number of the derangement

386
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
remember the number of the derangement
 

387
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,550
remember the number of the derangement
remember the arrangement yeah

388
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
remember the arrangement yeah
 

389
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,430
remember the arrangement yeah
yeah is is two one on derangement

390
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
yeah is is two one on derangement
 

391
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,909
yeah is is two one on derangement
yeah arrangement permutation yeah yeah

392
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
yeah arrangement permutation yeah yeah
 

393
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,470
yeah arrangement permutation yeah yeah
so

394
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
so
 

395
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,070
so
look at fibonacci number fn equals fn

396
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
look at fibonacci number fn equals fn
 

397
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,870
look at fibonacci number fn equals fn
minus 1

398
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
minus 1
 

399
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,990
minus 1
plus fn minus 2 right yeah

400
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
plus fn minus 2 right yeah
 

401
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,389
plus fn minus 2 right yeah
so the arrangement you just times a

402
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
so the arrangement you just times a
 

403
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,910
so the arrangement you just times a
minus one

404
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
minus one
 

405
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,590
minus one
yeah remember you still remember here

406
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
yeah remember you still remember here
 

407
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,030
yeah remember you still remember here
this one yeah

408
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
this one yeah
 

409
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,910
this one yeah
yeah it's the same so top down is that i

410
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
yeah it's the same so top down is that i
 

411
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,910
yeah it's the same so top down is that i
want to calculate fn

412
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
want to calculate fn
 

413
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,470
want to calculate fn
and i need to solve a smaller problem

414
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
and i need to solve a smaller problem
 

415
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,590
and i need to solve a smaller problem
first

416
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
first
 

417
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,350
first
yeah but when i calculate f n i mean so

418
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
yeah but when i calculate f n i mean so
 

419
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,389
yeah but when i calculate f n i mean so
i may have to solve the smaller problems

420
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
i may have to solve the smaller problems
 

421
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,430
i may have to solve the smaller problems
multiple times

422
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
multiple times
 

423
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,269
multiple times
and in order to speed it up we need to

424
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
and in order to speed it up we need to
 

425
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,910
and in order to speed it up we need to
add uh what

426
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
add uh what
 

427
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,389
add uh what
i know what the magic key was above the

428
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
i know what the magic key was above the
 

429
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,670
i know what the magic key was above the
function was that

430
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
function was that
 

431
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,630
function was that
cache yes we are done to memorize it

432
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
cache yes we are done to memorize it
 

433
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,230
cache yes we are done to memorize it
let's call let's make it

434
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
let's call let's make it
 

435
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,710
let's call let's make it
let's make it a top-down dynamic

436
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
let's make it a top-down dynamic
 

437
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,310
let's make it a top-down dynamic
programming all right

438
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
programming all right
 

439
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,030
programming all right
okay so let's let's do this fn is

440
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
okay so let's let's do this fn is
 

441
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,990
okay so let's let's do this fn is
represent the

442
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
represent the
 

443
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,150
represent the
number of the least number of perfect

444
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
number of the least number of perfect
 

445
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,310
number of the least number of perfect
squares to add up to n right

446
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
squares to add up to n right
 

447
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,550
squares to add up to n right
yeah it's been already no minutes yes

448
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
yeah it's been already no minutes yes
 

449
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,990
yeah it's been already no minutes yes
yes let's find okay

450
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
yes let's find okay
 

451
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,269
yes let's find okay
define f n what's what's missing

452
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
define f n what's what's missing
 

453
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:47,850

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,870
numbers add up to zero
zero

466
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880

 

467
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,550

yes okay so the answer

468
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
yes okay so the answer
 

469
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,110
yes okay so the answer
answer equals a very big number at the

470
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
answer equals a very big number at the
 

471
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,829
answer equals a very big number at the
beginning

472
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
beginning
 

473
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,829
beginning
in python we can use this a very big

474
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
in python we can use this a very big
 

475
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,069
in python we can use this a very big
number

476
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
number
 

477
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,190
number
floating number and converted a string i

478
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
floating number and converted a string i
 

479
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,790
floating number and converted a string i
and s what inf stands for

480
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800

 

481
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,269

a very thick number what's less than one

482
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
a very thick number what's less than one
 

483
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,870
a very thick number what's less than one
yes we're done infinity

484
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
yes we're done infinity
 

485
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,990
yes we're done infinity
infinity and beyond infinity floating so

486
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,000
infinity and beyond infinity floating so
 

487
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,150
infinity and beyond infinity floating so
infinity a string converting to a flow

488
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
infinity a string converting to a flow
 

489
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,829
infinity a string converting to a flow
number so it means a very very big

490
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
number so it means a very very big
 

491
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,509
number so it means a very very big
number

492
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
number
 

493
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,509
number
yeah okay okay okay okay

494
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
yeah okay okay okay okay
 

495
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,110
yeah okay okay okay okay
yeah so look oh yeah

496
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
yeah so look oh yeah
 

497
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,150
yeah so look oh yeah
infinite so basically it's eight you're

498
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
infinite so basically it's eight you're
 

499
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,310
infinite so basically it's eight you're
writing the

500
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
writing the
 

501
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,030
writing the
sideways yeah yeah yeah so this is

502
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
sideways yeah yeah yeah so this is
 

503
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,269
sideways yeah yeah yeah so this is
infinity and if you put the minus is

504
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
infinity and if you put the minus is
 

505
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,150
infinity and if you put the minus is
means the negative infinity yeah so look

506
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
means the negative infinity yeah so look
 

507
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,269
means the negative infinity yeah so look
this is a line

508
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
this is a line
 

509
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,990
this is a line
yeah this is yellow here and you're

510
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
yeah this is yellow here and you're
 

511
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,350
yeah this is yellow here and you're
going away

512
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
going away
 

513
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,990
going away
infinity going that way negative

514
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
infinity going that way negative
 

515
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,030
infinity going that way negative
infinity yeah

516
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
infinity yeah
 

517
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,910
infinity yeah
got it so it's a symmetric line right

518
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
got it so it's a symmetric line right
 

519
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,710
got it so it's a symmetric line right
correct

520
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
correct
 

521
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,949
correct
so look answer is that then we we have

522
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
so look answer is that then we we have
 

523
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,750
so look answer is that then we we have
to do this

524
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
to do this
 

525
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,750
to do this
i equals one okay so y

526
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
i equals one okay so y
 

527
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,110
i equals one okay so y
i times i smaller equals n

528
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
i times i smaller equals n
 

529
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:30,069
i times i smaller equals n
right right

530
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079

 

531
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,550

answer equals mean look we are getting

532
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
answer equals mean look we are getting
 

533
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,910
answer equals mean look we are getting
the mean

534
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
the mean
 

535
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,310
the mean
answer and what f

536
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
answer and what f
 

537
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,590
answer and what f
and minus look tell me what to do i

538
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
and minus look tell me what to do i
 

539
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,990
and minus look tell me what to do i
times i what's what's missing here

540
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000

 

541
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,470

one add one add one yes you remember

542
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
one add one add one yes you remember
 

543
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,030
one add one add one yes you remember
that

544
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
that
 

545
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,829
that
one and then return what with an answer

546
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839
one and then return what with an answer
 

547
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,509
one and then return what with an answer
yeah

548
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519

 

549
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,949

so this is eventually making it uh what

550
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
so this is eventually making it uh what
 

551
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,829
so this is eventually making it uh what
uh dynamic programming yeah but there's

552
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
uh dynamic programming yeah but there's
 

553
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,550
uh dynamic programming yeah but there's
something

554
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
something
 

555
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,629
something
high that's something that's something

556
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
high that's something that's something
 

557
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,350
high that's something that's something
we see here

558
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360

 

559
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,470

that's something no because i y i i will

560
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
that's something no because i y i i will
 

561
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,509
that's something no because i y i i will
be needed to

562
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
be needed to
 

563
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,069
be needed to
increment one so let's miss i equals one

564
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
increment one so let's miss i equals one
 

565
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,990
increment one so let's miss i equals one
so because we try the one

566
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
so because we try the one
 

567
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,870
so because we try the one
one times one is perfect square is one

568
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
one times one is perfect square is one
 

569
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,750
one times one is perfect square is one
one is two

570
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
one is two
 

571
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,430
one is two
yeah one is two one is two

572
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
yeah one is two one is two
 

573
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,470
yeah one is two one is two
two times two is four right yeah f and

574
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
two times two is four right yeah f and
 

575
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,750
two times two is four right yeah f and
minus two plus one

576
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
minus two plus one
 

577
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,990
minus two plus one
when one i is three three times three

578
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
when one i is three three times three
 

579
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,350
when one i is three three times three
nine and minus nine plus one right yeah

580
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
nine and minus nine plus one right yeah
 

581
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,629
nine and minus nine plus one right yeah
so basically f n equals f n

582
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
so basically f n equals f n
 

583
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,750
so basically f n equals f n
minus one plus one and

584
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
minus one plus one and
 

585
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,870
minus one plus one and
f n minus four plus one f n minus nine

586
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
f n minus four plus one f n minus nine
 

587
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,069
f n minus four plus one f n minus nine
plus one and f

588
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
plus one and f
 

589
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,350
plus one and f
n minus one plus one what's next

590
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
n minus one plus one what's next
 

591
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,710
n minus one plus one what's next
what's next when i is four

592
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720

 

593
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,670

and minus four times four sixteen plus

594
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
and minus four times four sixteen plus
 

595
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,230
and minus four times four sixteen plus
one and what's next

596
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
one and what's next
 

597
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,350
one and what's next
5 25 plus one yeah you see so all this

598
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
5 25 plus one yeah you see so all this
 

599
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,670
5 25 plus one yeah you see so all this
possibility i need to consider and then

600
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
possibility i need to consider and then
 

601
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,509
possibility i need to consider and then
i will get this minimum yeah

602
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
i will get this minimum yeah
 

603
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,350
i will get this minimum yeah
you are getting the minimum okay so this

604
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
you are getting the minimum okay so this
 

605
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,310
you are getting the minimum okay so this
is the

606
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320

 

607
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,150

this is the top delta let me poke me

608
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
this is the top delta let me poke me
 

609
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,230
this is the top delta let me poke me
what's the complexity is it easy to see

610
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
what's the complexity is it easy to see
 

611
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,949
what's the complexity is it easy to see
is it easy to see what's the time

612
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
is it easy to see what's the time
 

613
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,790
is it easy to see what's the time
complexity can you make a guess

614
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
complexity can you make a guess
 

615
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,710
complexity can you make a guess
i guess i win oh um

616
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
i guess i win oh um
 

617
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,829
i guess i win oh um
oh and no it doesn't

618
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
oh and no it doesn't
 

619
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,430
oh and no it doesn't
no because look the here

620
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
no because look the here
 

621
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,949
no because look the here
here is oh oh

622
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
here is oh oh
 

623
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,870
here is oh oh
what is o square n right square n right

624
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
what is o square n right square n right
 

625
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,269
what is o square n right square n right
and then you need needing to calculate n

626
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
and then you need needing to calculate n
 

627
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,030
and then you need needing to calculate n
so it's all n square n

628
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040

 

629
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,949

squared yeah it's maybe it's not easy

630
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
squared yeah it's maybe it's not easy
 

631
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,350
squared yeah it's maybe it's not easy
to it's not easy to see but let's let's

632
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
to it's not easy to see but let's let's
 

633
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,509
to it's not easy to see but let's let's
turn this into butter up

634
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:01,519
turn this into butter up
 

635
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,829
turn this into butter up
dynamite programming you still need a

636
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
dynamite programming you still need a
 

637
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,550
dynamite programming you still need a
camera

638
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
camera
 

639
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,629
camera
no from the bottom we don't need look

640
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
no from the bottom we don't need look
 

641
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,629
no from the bottom we don't need look
remember this cache we can we can edit

642
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
remember this cache we can we can edit
 

643
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,470
remember this cache we can we can edit
the parameter like a notebook yeah yeah

644
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
the parameter like a notebook yeah yeah
 

645
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,670
the parameter like a notebook yeah yeah
and then we can either if

646
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
and then we can either if
 

647
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,150
and then we can either if
the end in no book and we return no book

648
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
the end in no book and we return no book
 

649
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,550
the end in no book and we return no book
end and before this we can

650
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
end and before this we can
 

651
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,949
end and before this we can
answer we will say the answer not to

652
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
answer we will say the answer not to
 

653
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,750
answer we will say the answer not to
notebook end

654
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
notebook end
 

655
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,870
notebook end
and return answer yeah yeah okay so look

656
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
and return answer yeah yeah okay so look
 

657
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,150
and return answer yeah yeah okay so look
so we for the bottom arm for the bottom

658
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
so we for the bottom arm for the bottom
 

659
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,470
so we for the bottom arm for the bottom
we need a array let's say dt equals

660
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
we need a array let's say dt equals
 

661
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,430
we need a array let's say dt equals
let's make everything bigger infinite

662
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
let's make everything bigger infinite
 

663
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,310
let's make everything bigger infinite
yeah

664
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
yeah
 

665
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,509
yeah
in infinite and times

666
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519
in infinite and times
 

667
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,069
in infinite and times
n plus one okay because from zero to n

668
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
n plus one okay because from zero to n
 

669
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,790
n plus one okay because from zero to n
and n

670
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
and n
 

671
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,350
and n
yeah from zero to n there are n plus one

672
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
yeah from zero to n there are n plus one
 

673
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,710
yeah from zero to n there are n plus one
elements i'm right

674
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
elements i'm right
 

675
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,910
elements i'm right
yeah yeah i'm right

676
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
yeah yeah i'm right
 

677
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,829
yeah yeah i'm right
okay so now d p zero is zero okay

678
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
okay so now d p zero is zero okay
 

679
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,269
okay so now d p zero is zero okay
this is easy yeah and then for

680
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
this is easy yeah and then for
 

681
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,350
this is easy yeah and then for
i in range yeah

682
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
i in range yeah
 

683
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,470
i in range yeah
one to n plus one right yeah

684
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
one to n plus one right yeah
 

685
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,750
one to n plus one right yeah
and then here look j equals one

686
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
and then here look j equals one
 

687
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,030
and then here look j equals one
y j times j you tell me okay

688
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
y j times j you tell me okay
 

689
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,949
y j times j you tell me okay
smaller equals i yes look

690
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
smaller equals i yes look
 

691
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,990
smaller equals i yes look
and then what should we do dp

692
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
and then what should we do dp
 

693
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,910
and then what should we do dp
okay dpi equals

694
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
okay dpi equals
 

695
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,189
okay dpi equals
mean dpi

696
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
mean dpi
 

697
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,629
mean dpi
and then t p i minus j

698
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639
and then t p i minus j
 

699
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,430
and then t p i minus j
times j and what's amazing here

700
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440

 

701
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,949

no no no i from one to n and then j

702
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
no no no i from one to n and then j
 

703
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,910
no no no i from one to n and then j
straight times j one yeah one yeah it's

704
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
straight times j one yeah one yeah it's
 

705
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,829
straight times j one yeah one yeah it's
the same thing yeah remember

706
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
the same thing yeah remember
 

707
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,150
the same thing yeah remember
yeah and then j what sorry what one

708
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
yeah and then j what sorry what one
 

709
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,189
yeah and then j what sorry what one
yay add add one you have to add one

710
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
yay add add one you have to add one
 

711
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,350
yay add add one you have to add one
because j for one and then the next one

712
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
because j for one and then the next one
 

713
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,949
