1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,520
yeah you're given a positive integer

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,960
within the inner format of string and

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,240
then we also give a

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,200
single digit like one so can you tell me

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,600
you can remove any one

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,800
in here and the result should be the

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,640
maximum

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,800
so if we can

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,720
even talking so how many ones in this

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,480
position obviously okay so which one

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,640
remove by removing the second one

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,120
by removing the second one what we got

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,440
is one two three four why by removing

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,719
the first one what we got a two three

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,800
one four

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,160
things two three one four is bigger than

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,480
one two three four so you need to tell

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,440
me it's two three five four got it

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,920
get it it's exactly the same

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,399
why is it exactly the same this number

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,039
22 000 is bigger than one thousand what

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,920
do you mean exactly the same

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,840
okay what is that

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,440
there's not the number in there good

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,320
question that's a very good question to

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,239
us that you just returned nothing

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,159
except

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,720
return one two three one four that's

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,560
right if at least i even use this like

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,360
nine for them

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,680
okay simple okay another example

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,200
five five six

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,040
five

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
two three

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,080
one if we want to remove the five so

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,960
which five remove gives the the next

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,320
second one the third one

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,479
the third one

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,000
yeah if you remove this one

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,920
that will be five five six two three one

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,079
yeah if we don't move the first one or

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,040
the second one it's all the same five

43
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,040
six five two

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,280
yeah it doesn't matter so

45
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,560
you just

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,159
so you just

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,520
the thing is that you need to tell me

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,520
this number

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,159
yeah it doesn't you don't need to tell

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,079
me which number which side we did it

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,759
okay

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,680
okay simple

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,599
any sauce

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,040
any sauce

55
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:16,239
uh you look at the number that's right

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,160
first of all look at numbers it has one

57
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,840
one of them and then easily just that

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,920
one okay okay that's that's a very good

59
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
point yeah

60
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,160
that's a very clever solution we go

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,400
through each digit if this digit is the

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,640
thing that we can delete right

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,760
then we try to do it to see what number

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,959
we can get

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,040
for things

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,920
and we maintain it back okay so look

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,319
this number okay so this is the one two

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,239
three four five okay so if we want to

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,640
remove this uh digit so this is i

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,239
this is the index i so we want to remove

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,319
the digit

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,280
sorry

73
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,120
so

74
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,840
s equals one two three four five if we

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,360
want to remove the index i i which is

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,480
here right so what we can do is look is

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,480
s

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,400
up to i not including right not

79
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,519
including this digit plus s

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,760
i plus 1 to the n right i plus 1 is here

81
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,400
to the end so basically what we are

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,040
saying by removing the

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,360
the index the character index 3

84
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,120
we are using the string

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,480
concatenation

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,400
up to i is 1 2 right look

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,680
s up to i is 1 2 x i plus 1 to the n is

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,440
4 5

89
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,959
so s up to i this big plus s i plus 1 to

90
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,959
the n this bit

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,920
1 2 plus 4 5.

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,400
it's the same thing as mu nu 3. okay

93
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,840
yeah got it that's so simple so we can

94
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000
just do this

95
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,200
yeah today basically this is a simple

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,319
question

97
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,400
this is the question to test your python

98
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,959
the list the string

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,599
concatenation defined

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,360
as a max

101
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,959
remove

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
okay let's say we have given these

103
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,200
numbers

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,720
num

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,680
and we given this the k

106
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,120
okay so at the beginning answer you know

107
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,959
because these are

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,640
we are only given this the positive

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,000
individual right so we can just can

110
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,600
compare

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,960
two numbers by using compare

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,000
by comparing the layer string format so

113
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,759
what what i'm saying is that 1 2 3 is

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,880
bigger than

115
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,479
one

116
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,800
zero one right

117
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,720
this is the same thing as one two three

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,160
the integer bigger than one or one is

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,560
the same

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,120
yeah so we can either compare because

121
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,680
we're given this the string

122
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,600
we can compare directly the string or we

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,240
can convert it to integer

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,320
so if this one two three if we can

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,400
convert it to ind

126
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,360
this will give out one two three this is

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400
the numerical format this is a string

128
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
vice versa

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,600
so we use the str functions

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,080
one two three this will give us

131
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,520
one two three okay so this is the basic

132
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,919
look

133
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,840
one two three this is a string we use

134
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,320
the int and they'll give us the

135
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,400
numerator if you want to think

136
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,960
in the opposite way one two three this

137
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,039
is the number we put str stands for

138
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,960
string we got the

139
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,120
quote one two three

140
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,320
when i said a code is a string it's not

141
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,440
a number but we can compare the number

142
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,440
the string yeah all the numerical values

143
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,520
that's what i'm saying so answer equals

144
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,880
at the beginning we put nothing there

145
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,759
okay

146
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,840
but okay so the thing is that previously

147
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,680
ryan you asked a very good question

148
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,400
what happened if k is not in numbers

149
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,440
yeah

150
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,320
yeah so we have to make a special

151
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,919
case for that to check okay so i'll talk

152
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,360
about that yeah

153
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,800
so look answer equal that then if we o4

154
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,919
i j

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,600
in enumerate okay what's enumerate i

156
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,080
talked about it i use this function a

157
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,520
lot in numerator what's that mean

158
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,000
uh index and values yeah

159
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,720
index value basically this is the very

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,120
helpful useful function so we don't have

161
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,840
to use it but by using that

162
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,240
yeah we can get the index and the value

163
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,880
at the same time if we don't use the

164
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,160
enumerate we have to do this for i in

165
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,600
range

166
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,080
lens number

167
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,919
then j would be

168
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,960
num i okay but by using this we make our

169
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,880
curve much cleaner for i j this is the

170
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,039
yeah top

171
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,720
topper is basically like a

172
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,199
immutable

173
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,759
list what's immutable

174
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,160
what's immutable anybody

175
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,560
can't change it yeah what's the opposite

176
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,599
of it

177
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,080
[Music]

178
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,479
means the opposite okay so for i j i is

179
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,160
the index j is the value okay so now we

180
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,160
check if j equal equal k okay okay

181
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,440
suppose this is the string

182
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,160
a character

183
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,400
if j character if current j character is

184
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,039
the character we can remove

185
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,880
right then we can do this answer equals

186
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,400
next answer we want to get a maximum

187
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,680
answer answer

188
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,400
what do we do

189
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,599
remember we talk about these yeah to get

190
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,120
uh

191
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,240
s equal as a string a string any string

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,000
ryan

193
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,479
and this is the index i we want to

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,199
remove so how do we move it

195
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,800
s

196
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,039
up to i

197
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:36,560
plus s i plus 1 to the n okay

198
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,960
yeah everyone right to get this point we

199
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,680
want to remove the string

200
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,960
we move the index i character from the

201
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,039
string s what we what we did is what we

202
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,800
use the string concatenation so

203
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,039
basically we are saying that okay we are

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,759
using the characters up to i

205
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,759
and we skip this character i and we use

206
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,080
the character

207
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,400
from i plus one to the n right so this

208
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,160
is this is the way to remove these ites

209
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,199
characters from the string

210
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,759
then

211
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,759
find the max answer

212
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,039
num

213
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,000
after i

214
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,520
plus

215
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,440
num

216
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,280
i plus one yeah

217
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,160
and then return

218
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,000
answer okay so look if if k is not here

219
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,039
that would return now right so

220
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,560
we probably can check we can answer if

221
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,440
answer

222
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,720
s yeah yes num right

223
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,840
okay

224
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,840
we can change these

225
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,000
into one line yeah so we can just say

226
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,680
return

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,680
maximum

228
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,800
maximum one

229
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,240
maximum of num

230
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,279
up to i plus num

231
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,320
i plus 1 to the n

232
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,120
for

233
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
i

234
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,480
j

235
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
in enumerate

236
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,279
num

237
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,080
if j equal equal k okay

238
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,480
okay

239
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,440
any question so far so so does this

240
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,279
handle the case that when the k

241
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,640
is not in

242
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,519
nouns

243
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,399
so if it's not in nouns okay look so

244
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,480
look if j is in not enough so look when

245
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,320
we call this max something

246
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,440
we're not going to get the maximum

247
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,839
element from a list yeah on from a list

248
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,959
if the list is empty then there will be

249
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,279
a problem

250
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,480
when the list is empty we try to get a

251
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,480
maximum

252
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,720
and then there will be a problem right

253
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,440
because the list is empty let's work

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,839
what when the j

255
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,760
when the k is not in the list so in this

256
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,160
case we have to put a second parameter

257
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,080
which is before we can say default

258
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,839
equals now okay

259
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,640
so what does it mean it means that when

260
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,760
the k is not in the list

261
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,920
then

262
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,600
these this the first parameter will be

263
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,440
empty then in the in the case when

264
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,519
when the list is empty now we return the

265
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,399
number so this is the basically

266
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,839
the

267
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,360
return answer is answer because if it is

268
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,760
there is no k

269
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,079
that equals to j then these will not

270
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,440
never be executed and an answer would be

271
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,120
always empty

272
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,760
and then if answer

273
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,079
if the answer is empty then we return

274
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,480
the number okay so we're changing one

275
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,279
two three four five five lines into one

276
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,399
ninth okay the time come back see

277
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,120
if there are n characters in the string

278
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,320
in the numbers what what what's the time

279
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,800
frame next um

280
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,200
space complexity are one constant right

281
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,920
so that if we consider

282
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,839
if we can see the these doesn't use

283
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,040
additional space okay

284
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,720
so a one okay but if this is needs

285
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,839
another space then

286
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,120
away okay so what have you learned today

287
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,920
about

288
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,680
that what what in one sentence can you

289
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,240
tell everybody like what have you

290
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,740
learned today just one sentence

291
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,850
um

292
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,850
[Music]

293
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,080
[Music]

294
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,440
and then you find the biggest

295
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,160
exactly another way

296
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,640
yeah and then what's the solution

297
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,519
what's our solution

298
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,519
how do we do this

299
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,880
yeah how do we

300
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
yeah

301
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,720
every possibility of removing each digit

302
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,680
yeah if we go through this digit one by

303
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,839
one

304
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,920
and if this digit we can delete it we

305
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,600
try to do it and we a

306
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,350
number yeah we compare

307
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,720
okay that's it for today bye bye

308
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,720
