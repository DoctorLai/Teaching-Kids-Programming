okay so today we're going to talk about
 

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,629
okay so today we're going to talk about
a

8
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
a
 

9
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,830
a
interesting program called the number of

10
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:13,840
interesting program called the number of
 

11
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,310
interesting program called the number of
bricks

12
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
bricks
 

13
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,750
bricks
next layout okay so what does it mean so

14
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:17,760
next layout okay so what does it mean so
 

15
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,950
next layout okay so what does it mean so
given the bricks of the size like look

16
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
given the bricks of the size like look
 

17
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,550
given the bricks of the size like look
if this is two at least it's three okay

18
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
if this is two at least it's three okay
 

19
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,070
if this is two at least it's three okay
the size the wheels with

20
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
the size the wheels with
 

21
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,429
the size the wheels with
okay ten of weave and we have uh uh

22
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
okay ten of weave and we have uh uh
 

23
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,270
okay ten of weave and we have uh uh
we want to we want to face the bricks

24
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
we want to we want to face the bricks
 

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,190
we want to we want to face the bricks
okay in uh width

26
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
okay in uh width
 

27
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,389
okay in uh width
and then there will be arrays rows

28
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
and then there will be arrays rows
 

29
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,990
and then there will be arrays rows
the height okay that's high let's call

30
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
the height okay that's high let's call
 

31
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,549
the height okay that's high let's call
it height

32
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559

 

33
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,670

the height okay so for example there are

34
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
the height okay so for example there are
 

35
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,709
the height okay so for example there are
four and each one is the same

36
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
four and each one is the same
 

37
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,630
four and each one is the same
because we consider the height of the

38
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
because we consider the height of the
 

39
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,910
because we consider the height of the
bricks is one

40
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
bricks is one
 

41
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,069
bricks is one
right so that will be one two maybe okay

42
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
right so that will be one two maybe okay
 

43
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,869
right so that will be one two maybe okay
one two three four five six high equals

44
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
one two three four five six high equals
 

45
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,270
one two three four five six high equals
six

46
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
six
 

47
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,109
six
okay so the width is five

48
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
okay so the width is five
 

49
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,350
okay so the width is five
how many ways of placing it we can only

50
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
how many ways of placing it we can only
 

51
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,310
how many ways of placing it we can only
place the

52
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
place the
 

53
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,070
place the
uh the break horizontally one by one

54
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
uh the break horizontally one by one
 

55
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,550
uh the break horizontally one by one
okay

56
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
okay
 

57
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,830
okay
so consider only one row

58
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
so consider only one row
 

59
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,990
so consider only one row

178
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760

 

179
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,070

you can give me you don't need to give

180
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
you can give me you don't need to give
 

181
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,830
you can give me you don't need to give
me the actual answer right

182
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
me the actual answer right
 

183
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,390
me the actual answer right
two 32

184
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
two 32
 

185
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,830
two 32
32 2 x 2 4 4 x 4

186
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
32 2 x 2 4 4 x 4
 

187
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,270
32 2 x 2 4 4 x 4
16 16 x 2 32 64. okay

188
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
16 16 x 2 32 64. okay
 

189
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,670
16 16 x 2 32 64. okay
so the thing is that you multiply you're

190
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
so the thing is that you multiply you're
 

191
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,350
so the thing is that you multiply you're
not adding it together you're not saying

192
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
not adding it together you're not saying
 

193
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,789
not adding it together you're not saying
oh 6 2 and then

194
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
oh 6 2 and then
 

195
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,470
oh 6 2 and then
12. it's the same okay a to b two ways

196
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
12. it's the same okay a to b two ways
 

197
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,670
12. it's the same okay a to b two ways
look right a to b c

198
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
look right a to b c
 

199
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,869
look right a to b c
d e f okay a to b

200
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
d e f okay a to b
 

201
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,070
d e f okay a to b
two b to c two

202
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
two b to c two
 

203
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,789
two b to c two
got it yeah because each row has two

204
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
got it yeah because each row has two
 

205
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,310
got it yeah because each row has two
possibilities and

206
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
possibilities and
 

207
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,189
possibilities and
how many ways of placing all these six

208
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
how many ways of placing all these six
 

209
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,230
how many ways of placing all these six
rows to

210
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
rows to
 

211
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,830
rows to
to fulfill the the wall with the

212
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
to fulfill the the wall with the
 

213
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,189
to fulfill the the wall with the
two bricks yeah two to the power of six

214
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
two bricks yeah two to the power of six
 

215
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,110
two bricks yeah two to the power of six
okay okay okay okay so how can we do

216
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
okay okay okay okay so how can we do
 

217
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,830
okay okay okay okay so how can we do
this

218
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
this
 

219
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,950
this
if we given a bricks bricks is the size

220
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
if we given a bricks bricks is the size
 

221
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,590
if we given a bricks bricks is the size
of the bricks okay let's say bricks

222
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
of the bricks okay let's say bricks
 

223
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,110
of the bricks okay let's say bricks
which is a list of two and three

224
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
which is a list of two and three
 

225
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,150
which is a list of two and three
and now we want the height

226
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
and now we want the height
 

227
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,230
and now we want the height
height let's say height equals

228
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
height let's say height equals
 

229
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,070
height let's say height equals
height equals one four okay

230
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
height equals one four okay
 

231
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,110
height equals one four okay
and then we have at least with

232
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
and then we have at least with
 

233
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,950
and then we have at least with
with with equals

234
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
with with equals
 

235
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,110
with with equals
five and then you need to tell me is

236
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
five and then you need to tell me is
 

237
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,230
five and then you need to tell me is
what is two to the power of four okay

238
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
what is two to the power of four okay
 

239
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,670
what is two to the power of four okay
because for we can use

240
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
because for we can use
 

241
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,230
because for we can use
use two and three bricks of size of two

242
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
use two and three bricks of size of two
 

243
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,350
use two and three bricks of size of two
and three

244
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
and three
 

245
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,710
and three
to complete to to fulfill

246
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
to complete to to fulfill
 

247
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,629
to complete to to fulfill
the war one one row of war

248
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
the war one one row of war
 

249
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,550
the war one one row of war
with size five it's two plus three or

250
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
with size five it's two plus three or
 

251
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,390
with size five it's two plus three or
three plus two and they are

252
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
three plus two and they are
 

253
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,430
three plus two and they are
if that wall has four meters high

254
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
if that wall has four meters high
 

255
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,749
if that wall has four meters high
right so that's two to the power four

256
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
right so that's two to the power four
 

257
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,189
right so that's two to the power four
okay

258
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
okay
 

259
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,550
okay
so remember we have talked about

260
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
so remember we have talked about
 

261
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,870
so remember we have talked about
these this this is actually let's

262
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
these this this is actually let's
 

263
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,390
these this this is actually let's
consider because if we consider this fn

264
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
consider because if we consider this fn
 

265
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,629
consider because if we consider this fn
okay if you consider fn is the number of

266
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
okay if you consider fn is the number of
 

267
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,469
okay if you consider fn is the number of
ways to place the bricks of this type

268
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
ways to place the bricks of this type
 

269
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,870
ways to place the bricks of this type
in the single wall and the answer would

270
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
in the single wall and the answer would
 

271
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,749
in the single wall and the answer would
be f n

272
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
be f n
 

273
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,790
be f n
y to the power of 1 to the power 1

274
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
y to the power of 1 to the power 1
 

275
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,590
y to the power of 1 to the power 1
so actually f n and f s n is f

276
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600

 

277
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,990

the answer will be f v to the power of

278
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
the answer will be f v to the power of
 

279
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,350
the answer will be f v to the power of
height right

280
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
height right
 

281
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,110
height right
double double height to the power high

282
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
double double height to the power high
 

283
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,189
double double height to the power high
okay so that's the answer so we know

284
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
okay so that's the answer so we know
 

285
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,230
okay so that's the answer so we know
this height

286
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
this height
 

287
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,590
this height
is to be calculated this way so we just

288
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
is to be calculated this way so we just
 

289
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,790
is to be calculated this way so we just
want to

290
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
want to
 

291
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,870
want to
calculate this function f width we just

292
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
calculate this function f width we just
 

293
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,950
calculate this function f width we just
need to focus on these f with

294
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
need to focus on these f with
 

295
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,990
need to focus on these f with
okay so how how can we do this f with so

296
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
okay so how how can we do this f with so
 

297
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,870
okay so how how can we do this f with so
so we can we can rephrase this problem

298
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
so we can we can rephrase this problem
 

299
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,430
so we can we can rephrase this problem
as

300
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
as
 

301
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,550
as

f n will be the sum of what the sum
remember

330
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
remember
 

331
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,589
remember
we talked about the sum this one sum

332
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
we talked about the sum this one sum
 

333
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,710
we talked about the sum this one sum
this is the sum

334
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
this is the sum
 

335
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,230
this is the sum
of f and minus

336
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
of f and minus
 

337
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,550
of f and minus
phi right well

338
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
phi right well
 

339
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,390
phi right well
i is belongs to the bricks

340
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
i is belongs to the bricks
 

341
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,830

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
okay and and and
 

343
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,749
okay and and and
bigger or equal i okay so this is the

344
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
bigger or equal i okay so this is the
 

345

00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
about recursion yeah
 

381
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,990
about recursion yeah
and we can we can memorize these yeah

382
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
and we can we can memorize these yeah
 

383
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,110
and we can we can memorize these yeah
what does that call

what does that call
if we memorize this minimization what do

386
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
if we memorize this minimization what do
 

387
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,270
if we memorize this minimization what do
we call it

388
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
we call it
 

389
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,510
we call it
yeah top down dynamic programming okay

f n okay uh maybe
we write it uh let's say the bricks

402
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
we write it uh let's say the bricks
 

403
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,430
we write it uh let's say the bricks
wait with the brakes we have got

okay with
 

427
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,509
okay with
which is the width of the wall height is

428
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
which is the width of the wall height is
 

429
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,550
which is the width of the wall height is
the height of wall

430
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
the height of wall
 

431

okay this is the terminal cases then

460
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
okay this is the terminal cases then
 

461
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,350
okay this is the terminal cases then
answer equals zero

462
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360

answer equals zero
we want to sum up for i

464
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
we want to sum up for i
 

465
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,509
we want to sum up for i
in breaks right

466
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519

 

467
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,640

now what what we need to do answer plus

468
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:13,650
now what what we need to do answer plus
 

469
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,949
now what what we need to do answer plus
[Music]

470

[Music]
 

471
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,990
[Music]
equals f f and

472
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
equals f f and
 

473
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,110
equals f f and
minus i yeah f and minus i okay because

474
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
minus i yeah f and minus i okay because
 

475
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,590
minus i yeah f and minus i okay because
look

476
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
look
 

477
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,269
look
let's look look look fn

478
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
let's look look look fn
 

479
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,630
let's look look look fn
f n we just say is the sum of

480
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
f n we just say is the sum of
 

481
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,470
f n we just say is the sum of
f m minus i where

482
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
f m minus i where
 

483
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,509
f m minus i where
i is belongs to bricks okay

484
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
i is belongs to bricks okay
 

485
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,790
i is belongs to bricks okay
yeah okay and and i and

486
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
yeah okay and and i and
 

487
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,790
yeah okay and and i and
it needs to be bigger or equal than i

488
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
it needs to be bigger or equal than i
 

489
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,310
it needs to be bigger or equal than i
but that's okay we don't check here

490
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
but that's okay we don't check here
 

491
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,389
but that's okay we don't check here
because if n is smaller than zero we

492
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
because if n is smaller than zero we
 

493
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,230
because if n is smaller than zero we
would just return zero yeah

494
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
would just return zero yeah
 

495
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,630
would just return zero yeah
yeah written answer okay written answer

496
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
yeah written answer okay written answer
 

497
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,430
yeah written answer okay written answer
and what's missing here cash yeah if

498
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
and what's missing here cash yeah if
 

499
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,030
and what's missing here cash yeah if
we're not putting the cash what happened

500
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
we're not putting the cash what happened
 

501
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,470
we're not putting the cash what happened
what's the time come back see if we're

502
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
what's the time come back see if we're
 

503
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,269
what's the time come back see if we're
not putting the cash

504
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
not putting the cash
 

505
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,710
not putting the cash
if we put in the cash what's the

506
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
if we put in the cash what's the
 

507
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,230
if we put in the cash what's the
thumbnail i win

508
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
thumbnail i win
 

509
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,190
thumbnail i win
no i won no no no don't guess

510
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
no i won no no no don't guess
 

511
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,829
no i won no no no don't guess
now what's this oh this is if there are

512
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
now what's this oh this is if there are
 

513
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,389
now what's this oh this is if there are
n num

514
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
n num
 

515
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,430
n num
if they are n bricks okay so this is o n

516
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
if they are n bricks okay so this is o n
 

517
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,870
if they are n bricks okay so this is o n
but we're calling it right

518
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
but we're calling it right
 

519
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,509
but we're calling it right
so that will be we so this is all n

520
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
so that will be we so this is all n
 

521
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,710
so that will be we so this is all n
times

522
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
times
 

523
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,829
times
we oh we are calling look return

524
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
we oh we are calling look return
 

525
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,949
we oh we are calling look return
return f f word f with yeah

526
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
return f f word f with yeah
 

527
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,750
return f f word f with yeah
with times times this is to the power of

528
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
with times times this is to the power of
 

529
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,150
with times times this is to the power of
h

530
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
h
 

531
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,310
h
right yeah look this is to the power h

532
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
right yeah look this is to the power h
 

533
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,350
right yeah look this is to the power h
so f w is called for each

534
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
so f w is called for each
 

535
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,550
so f w is called for each
for each k f for each sw value right

536
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
for each k f for each sw value right
 

537
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,790
for each k f for each sw value right
we only calculating one but for each

538
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
we only calculating one but for each
 

539
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,829
we only calculating one but for each
event f

540
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
event f
 

541
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,670
event f
we need to sum up with greek so it's

542
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
we need to sum up with greek so it's
 

543
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,750
we need to sum up with greek so it's
actually o n times

544
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
actually o n times
 

545
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,310
actually o n times
w right okay yeah

546
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
w right okay yeah
 

547
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,670
w right okay yeah
doesn't make sense right

548
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
doesn't make sense right
 

549
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,310
doesn't make sense right
so if we don't put a cash value what

550
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
so if we don't put a cash value what
 

551
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,870
so if we don't put a cash value what
happens

552
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:03,880
happens
 

553
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,949
happens
explanation is exponential because

554
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
explanation is exponential because
 

555
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,509
explanation is exponential because
because these values some values are

556
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:09,519
because these values some values are
 

557
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,829
because these values some values are
calculating over again right

558
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
calculating over again right
 

559
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,670
calculating over again right
okay i can give you an example yeah so

560
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
okay i can give you an example yeah so
 

561
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,670
okay i can give you an example yeah so
let's say f

562
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
let's say f
 

563
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,230
let's say f
100 and then if the brick is two and

564
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
100 and then if the brick is two and
 

565
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,949
100 and then if the brick is two and
five two

566
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
five two
 

567
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,750
five two
two and five okay right so you will

568
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
two and five okay right so you will
 

569
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,550
two and five okay right so you will
calculate you

570
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
calculate you
 

571
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,990
calculate you
you need to calculate f f 90

572
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
you need to calculate f f 90
 

573
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,150
you need to calculate f f 90
a and then f 95 right

574
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
a and then f 95 right
 

575
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,150
a and then f 95 right
right and then that will be f what

576
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
right and then that will be f what
 

577
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,509
right and then that will be f what
f 96 and f

578
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
f 96 and f
 

579
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,790
f 96 and f
90 uh

580
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800

 

581
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,910

okay let's write another way f

582
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
okay let's write another way f
 

583
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,230
okay let's write another way f
f2 and f1 okay f99 and f90

584
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
f2 and f1 okay f99 and f90
 

585
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,750
f2 and f1 okay f99 and f90
a and f96 and 97

586
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
a and f96 and 97
 

587
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,430
a and f96 and 97
and that would be s90a and

588
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
and that would be s90a and
 

589
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,150
and that would be s90a and
f f1 97

590
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
f f1 97
 

591
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,829
f f1 97
you see look this f90 is calculating

592
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
you see look this f90 is calculating
 

593
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,710
you see look this f90 is calculating
here and

594
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
here and
 

595
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,990
here and
here f97 here and here

596
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
here f97 here and here
 

597
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,350
here f97 here and here
and look there will be lots of

598
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
and look there will be lots of
 

599
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,150
and look there will be lots of
calculation under this f

600
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
calculation under this f
 

601
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,190
calculation under this f
right if we not caching this value

602
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:17,200
right if we not caching this value
 

603
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,829
right if we not caching this value
what happened when we come here we need

604
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
what happened when we come here we need
 

605
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:20,710
what happened when we come here we need
to do it again

606
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
to do it again
 

607
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,790
to do it again
right but if we remember we're already

608
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
right but if we remember we're already
 

609
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,949
right but if we remember we're already
calculating here we remember it

610
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
calculating here we remember it
 

611
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,190
calculating here we remember it
what we can do is well we just look up

612
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
what we can do is well we just look up
 

613
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,550
what we can do is well we just look up
the value in a

614
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
the value in a
 

615
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,629
the value in a
notebook right in a hash table that's

616
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
notebook right in a hash table that's
 

617
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,750
notebook right in a hash table that's
why we put it

618
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
why we put it
 

619
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,710
why we put it
a cache right so that's why because look

620
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
a cache right so that's why because look
 

621
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,269
a cache right so that's why because look
f

622
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
f
 

623
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,509
f
100 100 is what 100 is the w value

624
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
100 100 is what 100 is the w value
 

625
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,069
100 100 is what 100 is the w value
so we we actually just need to calculate

626
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
so we we actually just need to calculate
 

627
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:42,949
so we we actually just need to calculate
f0

628
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
f0
 

629
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,550
f0
to f1 to fw

630
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
to f1 to fw
 

631
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,949
to f1 to fw
for each for each f value we're only

632
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
for each for each f value we're only
 

633
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:49,990
for each for each f value we're only
calculating once

634
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
calculating once
 

635
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,470
calculating once
because we store it using cash right but

636
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
because we store it using cash right but
 

637
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,710
because we store it using cash right but
for each f function we need to

638
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
for each f function we need to
 

639
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,949
for each f function we need to
go through the bricks go through the

640
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
go through the bricks go through the
 

641
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,470
go through the bricks go through the
bricks right those are the bricks so

642
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
bricks right those are the bricks so
 

643
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:58,949
bricks right those are the bricks so
let's

644
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
let's
 

645
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,150
let's
let's uh n so

646
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
let's uh n so
 

647
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,230
let's uh n so
n and breaks so for each one so the

648
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
n and breaks so for each one so the
 

649
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,949
n and breaks so for each one so the
complexity will be w times n right

650
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
complexity will be w times n right
 

651
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,150
complexity will be w times n right
okay so this is called top-down dynamic

652
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
okay so this is called top-down dynamic
 

653
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,350
okay so this is called top-down dynamic
programming right

654
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,360
programming right
 

655
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,949
programming right
we use similar recursion with the

656
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
we use similar recursion with the
 

657
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,870
we use similar recursion with the
minimization got it

658
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
minimization got it
 

659
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,389
minimization got it
okay so tomorrow we are going to talk

660
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
okay so tomorrow we are going to talk
 

661
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,150
okay so tomorrow we are going to talk
about butter up okay

662
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
about butter up okay
 

663
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,870
about butter up okay
so can you explain to me what it is f w

664
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
so can you explain to me what it is f w
 

665
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,030
so can you explain to me what it is f w
time times h what's this

666
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
time times h what's this
 

667
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,389
time times h what's this
f with volumes times

668
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
f with volumes times
 

669
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,870
f with volumes times
h what's this do you still remember

670
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
h what's this do you still remember
 

671
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,269
h what's this do you still remember
what's this mean

672
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
what's this mean
 

673
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,629
what's this mean
2 times times 3 what's the answer

674
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639

 

675
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,629

what's this to the power right 2 to the

676
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
what's this to the power right 2 to the
 

677
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,550
what's this to the power right 2 to the
power 3 equals 1

678
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
power 3 equals 1
 

679
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,550
power 3 equals 1
what's the 2 to the power 3.

680
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
what's the 2 to the power 3.
 

681
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,829
what's the 2 to the power 3.
what's what's what's totally possibly

682
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
what's what's what's totally possibly
 

683
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,310
what's what's what's totally possibly
come on t remember this f w is one row

684
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
come on t remember this f w is one row
 

685
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,870
come on t remember this f w is one row
right

686
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
right
 

687
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,990
right
and then if there are three three rows

688
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
and then if there are three three rows
 

689
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,750
and then if there are three three rows
what's the answer if there are two ways

690
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:57,760
what's the answer if there are two ways
 

691
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,069
what's the answer if there are two ways
of two ways of placing one row

692
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
of two ways of placing one row
 

693
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,310
of two ways of placing one row
eight yeah so what would be two to the

694
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
eight yeah so what would be two to the
 

695
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,829
eight yeah so what would be two to the
power three is a right

696
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
power three is a right
 

697
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,710
power three is a right
is three three two times together okay

698
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
is three three two times together okay
 

699
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,350
is three three two times together okay
three

700
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
three
 

701
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,110
three
twos come together or you can write the

702
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
twos come together or you can write the
 

703
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,470
twos come together or you can write the
power

704
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
power
 

705
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,470
power
two three it's the same thing yeah two

706
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
two three it's the same thing yeah two
 

707
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,310
two three it's the same thing yeah two
to the power three or two times times

708
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
to the power three or two times times
 

709
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,189
to the power three or two times times
three okay

710
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
three okay
 

711
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,829
three okay
