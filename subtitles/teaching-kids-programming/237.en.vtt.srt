1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,230

hello babies hello mr ellie are you all

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,240
hello babies hello mr ellie are you all
 

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,590
hello babies hello mr ellie are you all
right

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:05,600
right
 

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,470
right
okay so today we talk about a list

6
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
okay so today we talk about a list
 

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,190
okay so today we talk about a list
problem

8
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,200
problem
 

9
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,350
problem
three for a list of numbers yeah seven

10
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
three for a list of numbers yeah seven
 

11
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,109
three for a list of numbers yeah seven
nine five

12
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,119
nine five
 

13
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,390
nine five
uh a 10 okay

14
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
uh a 10 okay
 

15
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,670
uh a 10 okay
so this is the least considering of uh

16
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680
so this is the least considering of uh
 

17
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,950
so this is the least considering of uh
consists of uh seven numbers

18
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
consists of uh seven numbers
 

19
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,990
consists of uh seven numbers
and you know the sub list sub sublist

20
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
and you know the sub list sub sublist
 

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,190
and you know the sub list sub sublist
sublist or service i mean like

22
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,200
sublist or service i mean like
 

23
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,310
sublist or service i mean like
i think that um what's the difference

24
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
i think that um what's the difference
 

25
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,069
i think that um what's the difference
between sublist and subsequence

26
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
between sublist and subsequence
 

27
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,660
between sublist and subsequence
so list is

28
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:41,670

 

29
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,110

[Music]

30
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
[Music]
 

31
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,430
[Music]
like you can see three and five and yeah

32
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
like you can see three and five and yeah
 

33
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,190
like you can see three and five and yeah
it's not it's not continued but it

34
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
it's not it's not continued but it
 

35
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,549
it's not it's not continued but it
you can chew but the order doesn't

36
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
you can chew but the order doesn't
 

37
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,630
you can chew but the order doesn't
matter yes three seven

38
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
matter yes three seven
 

39
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,270
matter yes three seven
six this is subsequent four seven six is

40
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
six this is subsequent four seven six is
 

41
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,029
six this is subsequent four seven six is
a service continuous okay

42
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
a service continuous okay
 

43
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,069
a service continuous okay
so how about if i wanted to to tell me

44
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
so how about if i wanted to to tell me
 

45
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,750
so how about if i wanted to to tell me
if it's possible to reverse

46
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
if it's possible to reverse
 

47
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,869
if it's possible to reverse
only once so i want to reverse only one

48
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
only once so i want to reverse only one
 

49
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,830
only once so i want to reverse only one
sublease

50
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
sublease
 

51
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,990
sublease
reverse ones sublist

52
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
reverse ones sublist
 

53
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,990
reverse ones sublist
so you can reverse any subjects only

54
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
so you can reverse any subjects only
 

55
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,510
so you can reverse any subjects only
once can you make

56
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
once can you make
 

57
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,510
once can you make
this this sorted sorted

58
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
this this sorted sorted
 

59
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,910
this this sorted sorted
sorted in ascending order okay in

60
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
sorted in ascending order okay in
 

61
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,149
sorted in ascending order okay in
ascending order so from a smaller number

62
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
ascending order so from a smaller number
 

63
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,830
ascending order so from a smaller number
to the fifth number

64
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
to the fifth number
 

65
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,149
to the fifth number
uh so for example this case can you tell

66
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
uh so for example this case can you tell
 

67
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,749
uh so for example this case can you tell
me if it's possible

68
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
me if it's possible
 

69
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,870
me if it's possible
to do this all right if it's possible to

70
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
to do this all right if it's possible to
 

71
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,950
to do this all right if it's possible to
reverse the subjects on these ones

72
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960

 

73
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,030

oh yeah you

74
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040

 

75
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,590

um can i need the more pen these are

76
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
um can i need the more pen these are
 

77
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,670
um can i need the more pen these are
running out

78
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680

 

79
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,990

ah interesting yeah yeah you're right

80
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
ah interesting yeah yeah you're right
 

81
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,789
ah interesting yeah yeah you're right
yes

82
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
yes
 

83
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,710
yes
i got a good pen okay

84
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
i got a good pen okay
 

85
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,789
i got a good pen okay
how about if i yeah you're right if you

86
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
how about if i yeah you're right if you
 

87
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,469
how about if i yeah you're right if you
reverse this pin that would be three

88
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
reverse this pin that would be three
 

89
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,109
reverse this pin that would be three
four

90
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
four
 

91
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,590
four
uh three four five six seven and eight

92
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
uh three four five six seven and eight
 

93
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,389
uh three four five six seven and eight
ten yeah

94
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
ten yeah
 

95
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,510
ten yeah
three four point six seven eight nine

96
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
three four point six seven eight nine
 

97
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,550
three four point six seven eight nine
okay okay so given any service

98
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
okay okay so given any service
 

99
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,589
okay okay so given any service
so now let's say three

100
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
so now let's say three
 

101
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,390
so now let's say three
four how about six seven five

102
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
four how about six seven five
 

103
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,869
four how about six seven five
uh a10 is this possible

104
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
uh a10 is this possible
 

105
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:32,470
uh a10 is this possible
reverse any service

106
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480

 

107
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,710

why is that because there is no way yeah

108
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
why is that because there is no way yeah
 

109
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,910
why is that because there is no way yeah
yeah it's not okay so okay so this

110
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
yeah it's not okay so okay so this
 

111
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,030
yeah it's not okay so okay so this
sorted you'll be three four five six

112
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
sorted you'll be three four five six
 

113
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,309
sorted you'll be three four five six
seven eight ten right that's obvious

114
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
seven eight ten right that's obvious
 

115
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,309
seven eight ten right that's obvious
so if i give you this hint how can you

116
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
so if i give you this hint how can you
 

117
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,670
so if i give you this hint how can you
tell me how can we do it

118
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
tell me how can we do it
 

119
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,110
tell me how can we do it
how can we change it is this the same

120
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
how can we change it is this the same
 

121
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,730
how can we change it is this the same
yeah

122
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:56,740
yeah
 

123
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,190
yeah
[Music]

124
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
[Music]
 

125
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,949
[Music]
okay and then um

126
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959

 

127
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,869

okay so you find out the first first

128
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
okay so you find out the first first
 

129
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,110
okay so you find out the first first
difference it's this bit

130
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
difference it's this bit
 

131
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,470
difference it's this bit
and okay so how about this how about

132
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
and okay so how about this how about
 

133
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,830
and okay so how about this how about
the the next step this

134
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840

 

135
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,750

is

136
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
is
 

137
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,790
is
yeah this is the last last

138
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
yeah this is the last last
 

139
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,509
yeah this is the last last
difference and then what's next we find

140
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
difference and then what's next we find
 

141
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,830
difference and then what's next we find
out the leftmost and the rightmost

142
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
out the leftmost and the rightmost
 

143
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,350
out the leftmost and the rightmost
difference this is a bit different

144
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
difference this is a bit different
 

145
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,869
difference this is a bit different
but what so you gonna reverse it so

146
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
but what so you gonna reverse it so
 

147
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,990
but what so you gonna reverse it so
that's why

148
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
that's why
 

149
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,470
that's why
seven six but it's not everything else

150
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
seven six but it's not everything else
 

151
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,190
seven six but it's not everything else
ah

152
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
ah
 

153
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,670
ah
way down we're done yes so yes you're

154
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
way down we're done yes so yes you're
 

155
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,309
way down we're done yes so yes you're
right yeah

156
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
right yeah
 

157
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,390
right yeah
so we find out the first difference and

158
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
so we find out the first difference and
 

159
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,990
so we find out the first difference and
find out the last difference

160
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
find out the last difference
 

161
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,149
find out the last difference
and then the index will reverse this bit

162
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
and then the index will reverse this bit
 

163
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,430
and then the index will reverse this bit
yeah to see if it's

164
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
yeah to see if it's
 

165
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,710
yeah to see if it's
the same as as the sorted so if it's not

166
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
the same as as the sorted so if it's not
 

167
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,550
the same as as the sorted so if it's not
the same then it's not possible if it's

168
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
the same then it's not possible if it's
 

169
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,350
the same then it's not possible if it's
the same

170
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
the same
 

171
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,630
the same
like this one five six seven you reverse

172
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
like this one five six seven you reverse
 

173
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,710
like this one five six seven you reverse
this speed will be the same right

174
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
this speed will be the same right
 

175
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,550
this speed will be the same right
okay so what's the term complexity for

176
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
okay so what's the term complexity for
 

177
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,390
okay so what's the term complexity for
this one

178
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:05,400

 

179
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,229

[Music]

180
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
[Music]
 

181
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,429
[Music]
what's the time complexity if you

182
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
what's the time complexity if you
 

183
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:19,430
what's the time complexity if you
if we if we go

184
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440

 

185
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,189

that's right but how about we want to

186
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
that's right but how about we want to
 

187
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,230
that's right but how about we want to
get these certificates

188
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240

 

189
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,749

what's the space complexity

190
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759

 

191
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,670

this is the additional space come on

192
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
this is the additional space come on
 

193
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,270
this is the additional space come on
yeah we want

194
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
yeah we want
 

195
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,310
yeah we want
we obviously we need to all right

196
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
we obviously we need to all right
 

197
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,110
we obviously we need to all right
oh n because we need the oem space to to

198
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
oh n because we need the oem space to to
 

199
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,749
oh n because we need the oem space to to
store the target yeah original

200
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
store the target yeah original
 

201
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,749
store the target yeah original
remember a few days ago we talked about

202
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
remember a few days ago we talked about
 

203
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,950
remember a few days ago we talked about
reverse sub-list

204
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
reverse sub-list
 

205
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,590
reverse sub-list
as many times as want and to check if

206
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
as many times as want and to check if
 

207
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,749
as many times as want and to check if
the target soft can convert it to target

208
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
the target soft can convert it to target
 

209
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,390
the target soft can convert it to target
right

210
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
right
 

211
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,950
right
yeah and that's bubbling yeah remember

212
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
yeah and that's bubbling yeah remember
 

213
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,749
yeah and that's bubbling yeah remember
then we

214
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
then we
 

215
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,310
then we
it turns out that if in order to convert

216
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
it turns out that if in order to convert
 

217
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,870
it turns out that if in order to convert
to

218
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
to
 

219
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,590
to
from the source to the target we need to

220
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
from the source to the target we need to
 

221
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,950
from the source to the target we need to
make sure that uh

222
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
make sure that uh
 

223
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,790
make sure that uh
we need to check if the two lists are in

224
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
we need to check if the two lists are in
 

225
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,510
we need to check if the two lists are in
the ground right remember still remember

226
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
the ground right remember still remember
 

227
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,710
the ground right remember still remember
yes okay so let's

228
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
yes okay so let's
 

229
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,830
yes okay so let's
let's do this

230
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840

 

231
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,029

let's do this

232
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039

 

233
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,230

if i we

234
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
if i we
 

235
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,510
if i we
just check okay check check

236
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
just check okay check check
 

237
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,710
just check okay check check
and then let's alarm lumps okay numbs

238
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720

 

239
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,110

okay so now we want to store a copy of

240
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
okay so now we want to store a copy of
 

241
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,830
okay so now we want to store a copy of
the

242
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
the
 

243
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,230
the
salted array so let's call it a r array

244
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
salted array so let's call it a r array
 

245
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,029
salted array so let's call it a r array
okay

246
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
okay
 

247
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,350
okay
array equal as well salted

248
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
array equal as well salted
 

249
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,550
array equal as well salted
yeah look salty salty num

250
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
yeah look salty salty num
 

251
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,830
yeah look salty salty num
all right okay satin numbers

252
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
all right okay satin numbers
 

253
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,430
all right okay satin numbers
this is the iterator but we're going to

254
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
this is the iterator but we're going to
 

255
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,749
this is the iterator but we're going to
put this yeah

256
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
put this yeah
 

257
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,950
put this yeah
or just saute okay and then now look i

258
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
or just saute okay and then now look i
 

259
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,469
or just saute okay and then now look i
equal i j

260
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
equal i j
 

261
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,990
equal i j
the left and right okay let's call it

262
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
the left and right okay let's call it
 

263
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,670
the left and right okay let's call it
left and right

264
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
left and right
 

265
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,790
left and right
left right equals zero the right will be

266
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
left right equals zero the right will be
 

267
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,629
left right equals zero the right will be
equal to one

268
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
equal to one
 

269
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,189
equal to one
right equals the last one minus one

270
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
right equals the last one minus one
 

271
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,670
right equals the last one minus one
length

272
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
length
 

273
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,029
length
a r minus one okay okay

274
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
a r minus one okay okay
 

275
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,510
a r minus one okay okay
then why they're not mean why are

276
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
then why they're not mean why are
 

277
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,230
then why they're not mean why are
smaller than

278
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
smaller than
 

279
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,749
smaller than
r okay and what n is the

280
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
r okay and what n is the
 

281
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,629
r okay and what n is the
nums a

282
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639

 

283
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,150

right look if it's equal to

284
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
right look if it's equal to
 

285
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,870
right look if it's equal to
num air

286
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
num air
 

287
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,029
num air
l plus equals one right look

288
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
l plus equals one right look
 

289
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,430
l plus equals one right look
why the left and right you know mid y

290
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
why the left and right you know mid y
 

291
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,749
why the left and right you know mid y
left is smaller than the right and if

292
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
left is smaller than the right and if
 

293
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,950
left is smaller than the right and if
the

294
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
the
 

295
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,230
the
original original number and

296
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
original original number and
 

297
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,150
original original number and
away at index air is equals to the salty

298
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
away at index air is equals to the salty
 

299
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,589
away at index air is equals to the salty
version right

300
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
version right
 

301
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,629
version right
okay salty version is the this one okay

302
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
okay salty version is the this one okay
 

303
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,790
okay salty version is the this one okay
can you write the next

304
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
can you write the next
 

305
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,350
can you write the next
can you know the next this is finding

306
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
can you know the next this is finding
 

307
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,150
can you know the next this is finding
the left

308
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
the left
 

309
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,710
the left
that's most leftmost position that

310
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
that's most leftmost position that
 

311
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,510
that's most leftmost position that
the first partition the ar a-r-l is not

312
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
the first partition the ar a-r-l is not
 

313
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,350
the first partition the ar a-r-l is not
equal to numbers so can you write the

314
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
equal to numbers so can you write the
 

315
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,550
equal to numbers so can you write the
right-most one it's quite similar

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,350
to check this yeah
air

342
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360

 

343
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,430

this is the salty version and this is

344
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
this is the salty version and this is
 

345
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,510
this is the salty version and this is
original version come on listen to me

346
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
original version come on listen to me
 

347
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,550
original version come on listen to me
l to one and two until the different one

348
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
l to one and two until the different one
 

349
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,629
l to one and two until the different one
which is all right but it needs to what

350
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
which is all right but it needs to what
 

351
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,309
which is all right but it needs to what
what plus one yeah

352
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
what plus one yeah
 

353
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,390
what plus one yeah
we want to check this is the third thing

354
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
we want to check this is the third thing
 

355
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,350
we want to check this is the third thing
yeah so we just

356
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
yeah so we just
 

357
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,589
yeah so we just
check return ai okay so let's

358
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
check return ai okay so let's
 

359
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,830
check return ai okay so let's
we need to convert this to sorted yeah

360
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
we need to convert this to sorted yeah
 

361
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,749
we need to convert this to sorted yeah
so we can just do this here

362
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
so we can just do this here
 

363
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,029
so we can just do this here
list this okay so now

364
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
list this okay so now
 

365
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,310
list this okay so now
return a r l

366
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
return a r l
 

367
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:46,389
return a r l
r plus one equal equal

368
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:46,399

 

369
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,350

yeah what's uh okay can you tell me

370
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
yeah what's uh okay can you tell me
 

371
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,190
yeah what's uh okay can you tell me
what's the time and space complexity

372
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
what's the time and space complexity
 

373
00:08:51,200 --> 00:09:07,590
what's the time and space complexity
again

374
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600

 

375
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,470

so we want to come listen listen away

376
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
so we want to come listen listen away
 

377
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,670
so we want to come listen listen away
the numbers

378
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
the numbers
 

379
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,230
the numbers
these b we need to reverse it to check

380
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
these b we need to reverse it to check
 

381
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,030
these b we need to reverse it to check
if reverse

382
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
if reverse
 

383
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,550
if reverse
equals starting right so actually here

384
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
equals starting right so actually here
 

385
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,110
equals starting right so actually here
needs to reverse

386
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
needs to reverse
 

387
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,509
needs to reverse
right reverse this remember we want to

388
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
right reverse this remember we want to
 

389
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,590
right reverse this remember we want to
reverse it to check if they are same

390
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
reverse it to check if they are same
 

391
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,550
reverse it to check if they are same
right

392
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
right
 

393
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,870
right
yeah and then convert it to this

394
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
yeah and then convert it to this
 

395
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,150
yeah and then convert it to this
okay does it make sense that's

396
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
okay does it make sense that's
 

397
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,350
okay does it make sense that's
shorter yeah that's shorter yeah that

398
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
shorter yeah that's shorter yeah that
 

399
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,430
shorter yeah that's shorter yeah that
one is shorter for one before

400
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
one is shorter for one before
 

401
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,710
one is shorter for one before
which one is shorter numbers l column of

402
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
which one is shorter numbers l column of
 

403
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,550
which one is shorter numbers l column of
plus one

404
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
plus one
 

405
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,829
plus one
yeah no no no we need to reverse it

406
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
yeah no no no we need to reverse it
 

407
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,310
yeah no no no we need to reverse it
remember

408
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
remember
 

409
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,990
remember
if it's 5 6 7 this is 30 if it is

410
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
if it's 5 6 7 this is 30 if it is
 

411
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,470
if it's 5 6 7 this is 30 if it is
7 6 5 we find out the left is here right

412
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
7 6 5 we find out the left is here right
 

413
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,670
7 6 5 we find out the left is here right
is here we need to

414
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
is here we need to
 

415
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,069
is here we need to
reverse this bit to see if it's the same

416
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
reverse this bit to see if it's the same
 

417
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,990
reverse this bit to see if it's the same
as the salty version right

418
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
as the salty version right
 

419
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,350
as the salty version right
let's yeah yeah so let's reverse reverse

420
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
let's yeah yeah so let's reverse reverse
 

421
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,430
let's yeah yeah so let's reverse reverse
but we need to convert it to the list

422
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
but we need to convert it to the list
 

423
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,509
but we need to convert it to the list
so okay got it actually we probably

424
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
so okay got it actually we probably
 

425
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,069
so okay got it actually we probably
don't need

426
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
don't need
 

427
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:22,069
don't need
this but that's okay okay

428
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079

 

429
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,150

so this bit what's the time complexity

430
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
so this bit what's the time complexity
 

431
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,230
so this bit what's the time complexity
for this these two loop

432
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
for this these two loop
 

433
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,829
for this these two loop
what's the term complexity for these two

434
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839

 

435
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,230

um and

436
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240

 

437
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,069

oh and just a one right you're meeting

438
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
oh and just a one right you're meeting
 

439
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,750
oh and just a one right you're meeting

443
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,829

okay uh i'm going to erase something

444
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
okay uh i'm going to erase something
 

445
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,030
okay uh i'm going to erase something
okay no

446
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040

 

447
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,550

just the last bit okay okay okay we got

448
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
just the last bit okay okay okay we got
 

449
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,509
just the last bit okay okay okay we got
the air here

450
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
the air here
 

451
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,790

00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
come on we got the r here uh
 

453
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:26,230
come on we got the r here uh
what do we need to do

454
