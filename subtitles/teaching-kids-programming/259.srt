1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
hello

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,679
hello area all right

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,679
yeah

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,760
so

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,960
let's review the binary tree first okay

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,759
the binary tree what's uh

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,920
what's the uh the final three has the

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,320
two kids they have two kids

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,279
the each night can have a

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,599
almost two kids and only one lude lute

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,279
has no parents and each other notes has

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,679
only one parents okay

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,599
okay

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,640
okay so if

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,960
if one note if e for this is this is the

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,360
primary tree and every level is for zero

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,320
we call it

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,360
perfect yeah perfect by anything yeah

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,320
okay

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,559
if a final tree is fulfilled every level

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
is that possibly the lowest one but the

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,640
lowest one

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,160
can only be fulfilled from left to right

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,239
then we call it

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,480
complete binary okay complete the

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,199
country so but is this a complete binary

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,239
no

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,280
why is that

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,080
because

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,080
it's there's a gap between yeah the last

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,960
level needs to be

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,680
yeah fulfilled from left to right and is

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,880
uh these

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,759
uh

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,119
how can we uh let's say

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,000
is lisa

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,560
complete the planetary or fulfill uh or

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,040
copyright you know yes or not right

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,200
because every level needs to fulfill but

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,360
and the last level needs to be fulfilled

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,000
from left to right okay we got it okay

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,000
so uh what's the final research tree

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,400
um

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,439
it's just like

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,520
a normal thing and what's the what's

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:48,640
special about it the primary surgery and

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,640
the parent networking with parents

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,240
right

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,320
the right needs to be bigger than their

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,640
parents and that needs to be smaller

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,119
than the parents here so when we search

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,360
locate the value either try to set your

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,280
value in the financial street we can we

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,200
can compare the current value if we like

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,960
we want to find a 5.

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,879
it's smaller than the root so we know

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,959
it's somewhere in the left tree right i

58
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,720
will keep walking every time if this

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,440
binary structure is balanced yeah

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,200
balance quite you know it's balanced the

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,360
height difference between any two nodes

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,440
is smaller than one smaller equal right

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,400
now with every time we do this

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,280
comparison

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,760
we can drop half of it right so what's

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,280
the time complexity of locating the

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,280
old log and we're done because every

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,680
time we drop half okay

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,200
down okay so now we talk about hip

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,000
remember the hip

71
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,920
hip is a binary data structure you know

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,480
a balance or we call it yeah balance

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,599
it's and we have two kinds of hips max

74
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:52,480
head and mean hip

75
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,760
okay the max hip so a hundred

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,360
ten

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
twenty

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,519
five six

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,120
six that's okay that's okay and then we

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,480
call it seven

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,080
eight okay

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,760
so what's special about max so the root

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,000
the parent

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,920
is bigger than the kid

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,360
okay then we call it maxi

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,360
and the what's main thing

87
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,599
the opposite is smaller right one two

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,879
three and it'll be four

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,720
five

90
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,360
six seven okay

91
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,159
so the parent is always smaller than the

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,799
kid

93
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,519
so what's special about asymmetric the

94
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,959
time complexity to retrieve the max or

95
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,879
mean the root

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,560
is one okay

97
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,599
it's a one okay so we want to build

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
a heap

99
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,200
why we want to use the heat because we

100
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,440
want to make

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,680
we want to take advantage of these you

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,200
know the constant time to retrieve the

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,879
data

104
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,560
from the root which is which could be

105
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,400
max or hit me

106
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,400
and to maintain it for example if we

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
want to put the value

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,799
inside it if we want to insert the value

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,360
inside the heap or taking a value

110
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,799
outside of him or deleting a

111
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,040
data

112
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,920
element of uh from the hip what's the

113
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,000
time connection can you think about

114
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,799
the in the worst case can you guess make

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,759
a case make a guess if we only if we put

116
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,040
like a 200 here how can we do it

117
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,600
if we take one out of it what can the

118
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,600
time come next

119
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,360
it doesn't matter for the max if we only

120
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,440
put a 200 here

121
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,240
so you can imagine there will be a

122
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,040
restructure of this right yeah

123
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,280
so

124
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,280
could be if we put we're comparing we

125
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,440
sometimes we need to pop you know swap

126
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,080
the parents with a kid and swapping out

127
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,440
of the until we reach the root right so

128
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,639
the time capacity will be o log n right

129
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,520
yeah to delete it as well if we delete

130
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,240
some

131
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,639
uh

132
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,720
the best cases is what if we just delete

133
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,800
this one this is the leaf now we'll just

134
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,080
delete it that would be one right

135
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,919
but if we want to delete the loot

136
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,199
like if we wanted to do we need to do

137
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,360
some rearrangement right yeah

138
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,039
sometimes involving swapping the parents

139
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,520
with the kids so the time come back

140
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,639
still be like overlooked and as well

141
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,840
okay but

142
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,039
these are quite a complex uh algorithm

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,479
right so

144
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,759
we will not cover today but you need to

145
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,280
get this general idea of this uh to

146
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,639
maintain

147
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,680
maintain a hip usually takes all log n

148
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,199
to

149
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,199
add a new element in or to

150
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,160
remove the element for example if i want

151
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,840
to add a another element like uh maximum

152
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
like one and i can just put it here

153
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,880
right without without restructuring the

154
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,880
main uh the mind hip right they look we

155
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,840
just put it there the terminal xt will

156
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,199
be just a one right yeah

157
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,600
okay so that's the

158
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,919
why are we using the heat okay

159
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,680
so how can we store the hip in

160
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,319
in an array

161
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,360
for example like this zero

162
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,720
one

163
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,680
two

164
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,560
three

165
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,080
four

166
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,800
five

167
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,840
six how can we store this in the array

168
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,680
do one two three four by six oh yeah

169
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,080
yeah we can just put it because the look

170
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,080
is a complete or it's a complete

171
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,739
[Music]

172
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,280
uh perfect pioneer tree yeah remember

173
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,960
perfect is kind of complete right

174
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,720
perfect it's kind of at least it's

175
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,120
perfect and you've removed some of the

176
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,840
elements from the lower it's never

177
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,400
the leaf from the right and it could be

178
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,960
complete so if it's complete we can just

179
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,080
please look in one by one level by level

180
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:51,280
yeah breakfast thirst yeah usually

181
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,360
zero one two three four five six

182
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,319
okay so

183
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,880
so

184
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,240
so look for this index the fbc index if

185
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,639
we want to retrieve the the left kids

186
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,120
what's the index of the left kid if if

187
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,240
the parent is i what's that what's its

188
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,599
left kid

189
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,080
index

190
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,120
what is life kid

191
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,120
what is like it

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,280
if this is i what's that what's the

193
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,280
index of this

194
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,199
plus one plus one

195
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,440
times two plus one right

196
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,440
and

197
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,560
i know what's this

198
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,120
times two plus one what's this twenty

199
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,520
plus three yeah times two plus two okay

200
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,360
okay for example two times two what look

201
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,599
two times two plus one is five why you

202
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,000
said plus one plus one is here

203
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,840
correct two times two plus one two times

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,879
two plus two right

205
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,039
all right yeah okay so given the heap

206
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,919
maximum let's say today start giving a

207
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,680
hit

208
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,879
we want to verify

209
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,039
if it's a max max heap okay because for

210
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,879
each morphology method

211
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,960
is that each numbers each pair each node

212
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,720
is always bigger than the

213
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,280
uh kids right

214
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,919
yeah will using the index okay so how

215
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,919
can we do this

216
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,560
i'm going to do this

217
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,520
defy

218
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,240
is

219
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,240
max heap

220
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,120
i will give you my numbers okay numbers

221
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,000
first of all we want to find out how

222
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,399
many of them right now uh

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,599
what's the function to find out how many

224
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,599
numbers in

225
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,279
in the in array

226
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,599
in this

227
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,599
lens

228
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,200
okay then how we want to go through to

229
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,959
the

230
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,959
for i the index yeah in range redux

231
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,000
do we need to go through the whole

232
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
oh we can just go to the house

233
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,760
yeah because we don't need to go to the

234
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,760
the

235
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,160
we can only go to the hub because if it

236
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,760
doesn't have any kids the least doesn't

237
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,560
have any kids we don't need to check

238
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,880
right

239
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,800
yeah so girls are half and divided by

240
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,760
two

241
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,760
okay number one is

242
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
if norms

243
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,440
i

244
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,880
if it's a smaller right because it's a

245
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,880
massive if it's smaller than

246
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,880
noun

247
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,360
what's that what's the left left trial

248
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,080
of the numbers i what i

249
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,519
what's the definite of i

250
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,560
times two times two and one

251
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,560
times two plus one

252
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,039
[Music]

253
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,720
if it's the opposite

254
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,240
we want to check first that because we

255
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,959
for each for each lam's i needs to be

256
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,800
bigger than numbs i plus two plus times

257
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,279
two plus one and we also need to check

258
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,680
if the

259
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,680
if i smaller than what's like it

260
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,360
what's the right kid

261
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,160
um

262
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,320
okay so there's a small problem is that

263
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,040
sometimes these does not exist it's kids

264
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,839
there's no it's left or right it doesn't

265
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,440
exist so we need to check if this index

266
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,040
is smaller than n right so we need to

267
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,320
put a another n here so if if what i

268
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,480
times two

269
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,360
plus one is smaller than n

270
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
and

271
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,399
right

272
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,240
okay and then here

273
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,200
if i turns to

274
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,360
plus two smaller than n if the right kid

275
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,480
if we have the right kid

276
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,079
and also the loot is smaller than the

277
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:14,120
kids then we determine got it make sense

278
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,120
yeah what's the time complexity

279
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,680
one one yes okay

280
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,640
okay so i'm going to erase this bit

281
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,680
already

282
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,760
yeah okay so you can you can

283
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,760
tell me what come on you want to write

284
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,959
and

285

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,839
sorry if they were i think i didn't see

287
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,920
what you're talking about

288
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,560
i want to compare the right kid okay so

289
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,480
how this is

290
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,320
if n no no no no there's something here

291
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,519
remember i i just talked about how to

292
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,519
check it okay

293
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,040
think about it how what do we talk about

294
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,120
think about

295
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,040
and we talked about

296
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,839
uh what are we doing here what what

297
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,800
what's it what what are we checking here

298
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,920
what's with chicken here

2 sorry

301
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,959
what are we doing here

302
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,959
we are

303
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,680
checking what right

304
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,240
this is therefore right

305
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,440
okay then what should we check in here

306
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,480
right okay so how do we check the right

307
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,120
something if sometimes

308
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,480
sorry if yeah plus two if i times two

309
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,600
plus two

310
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,639
smaller than one

311
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,959
then

312
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,040
we all want to check if we have a if we

313
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,720
then my kid has

314
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,880
n yeah

before i this well

320
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,639
leave what and this

00:13:52,160 --> 00:14:00,000
is what come on youtube here so what

322
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,000
should i do what's this be if i times t

323
