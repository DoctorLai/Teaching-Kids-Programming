basically it's the two times two

22
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
basically it's the two times two
 

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,349
basically it's the two times two
dimensional it's a

24
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
dimensional it's a
 

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,750
dimensional it's a
matching usually it's two times two so

26
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
matching usually it's two times two so
 

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,510
matching usually it's two times two so
in that person you can do this

28
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
in that person you can do this
 

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,030
in that person you can do this
a list of this yeah yeah so at least

30
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
a list of this yeah yeah so at least
 

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,630
a list of this yeah yeah so at least
at least a big list has three three list

32
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
at least a big list has three three list

00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
smallest so also can you notice
 

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,390
smallest so also can you notice
something special

36
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
something special
 

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,830
something special
about this magic yeah it goes down

38
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
about this magic yeah it goes down

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,230
i actually didn't notice it's already
salted yeah

48
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
salted yeah
 

49
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,149
salted yeah
so basically basically for each row

50
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
so basically basically for each row
 

51
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,630
so basically basically for each row
it's increasing it's salty yeah each

52
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
it's increasing it's salty yeah each
 

53
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,190
it's increasing it's salty yeah each

00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
column
 

55
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,310
column
is increasing yeah yeah yeah i saw that

56
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
is increasing yeah yeah yeah i saw that
 

57
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,350
is increasing yeah yeah yeah i saw that
okay well done okay now if i give you a

58
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
okay well done okay now if i give you a
 

59
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,190
okay well done okay now if i give you a
number

60
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
number
 

61
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,270
number
like four is it in the metric

62
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
like four is it in the metric
 

63
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,550
like four is it in the metric
yeah right yeah i know but computer you

64
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
yeah right yeah i know but computer you
 

65
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:59,650
yeah right yeah i know but computer you
need to take computer other search right

66
00:01:59,650 --> 00:01:59,660

target like t and then this matrix m

70
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
target like t and then this matrix m
 

71
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,750
target like t and then this matrix m
so can you tell me how to certify it mmt

72
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760

 

73
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,910

so how how do we search for it i need

74
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
so how how do we search for it i need
 

75
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,030
so how how do we search for it i need
any sauce

76
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
any sauce
 

77
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,470
any sauce
we can the the easiest way the most

78
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
we can the the easiest way the most
 

79
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,710
we can the the easiest way the most
intuitive way is to go through

80
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
intuitive way is to go through
 

81
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,830
intuitive way is to go through
each row and each column and then check

82
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
each row and each column and then check
 

83
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,030
each row and each column and then check
if this element is the same as t

84
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
if this element is the same as t
 

85
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,070
if this element is the same as t
right yeah yes

86
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
right yeah yes
 

87
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,589
right yeah yes
and what's the complexity if they are

88
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
and what's the complexity if they are
 

89
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,710
and what's the complexity if they are
if they are m rows and

90
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
if they are m rows and
 

91
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,510
if they are m rows and
n columns what's the

92
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:47,520

what complexity there are n rows and n

96
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
what complexity there are n rows and n
 

97
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,910
what complexity there are n rows and n
columns how many elements are there

98
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
columns how many elements are there
 

99
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,229
columns how many elements are there
yeah m times n not every time you're

100
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
yeah m times n not every time you're
 

101
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,750
yeah m times n not every time you're
guessing

102
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
guessing
 

103
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,869
guessing
you see because you are looking big you

104
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
you see because you are looking big you
 

105
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,270
you see because you are looking big you
are

106
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
are
 

107
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,949
are
you need to go through each element to

108
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
you need to go through each element to
 

109
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,390
you need to go through each element to
check right

110
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
check right
 

111
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,390
check right
right in the worst case in you know what

112
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
right in the worst case in you know what
 

113
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,589
right in the worst case in you know what
state i'm right

114
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
state i'm right
 

115
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,190
state i'm right
okay so this compares to your worst case

116
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
okay so this compares to your worst case
 

117
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,790
okay so this compares to your worst case
for example if the number does not

118
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
for example if the number does not
 

119
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,470
for example if the number does not
appear in the matching

120
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
appear in the matching
 

121
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,509
appear in the matching
then it takes n times n to check right

122
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
then it takes n times n to check right
 

123
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,070
then it takes n times n to check right
if i give you a number nine how do you

124
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
if i give you a number nine how do you
 

125
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,910
if i give you a number nine how do you
know how that how does the computer know

126
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
know how that how does the computer know
 

127
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,509
know how that how does the computer know
it's not in the metric

128
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
it's not in the metric
 

129
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,149
it's not in the metric
it has to check please list this this

smaller okay so does it go left or
 

157
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,630
smaller okay so does it go left or
down it goes like yeah

00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
smaller than six
 

163
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,030
smaller than six
should i go left until i go down to look

164
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
should i go left until i go down to look
 

165
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,990
should i go left until i go down to look
for it

00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
the second version is if we have these
 

213
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,230
the second version is if we have these
rows columns

equals uh let's do this rows
 

217
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,950
equals uh let's do this rows
equals length m yeah that envelope

218
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
equals length m yeah that envelope
 

219
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,029
equals length m yeah that envelope
i'm well thank you if zero equals rows

220
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
i'm well thank you if zero equals rows
 

221
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,189
i'm well thank you if zero equals rows
if it's empty then we need to return

00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
this is anti-magic a magic can be empty
 

227
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,510

row columns equals n
 

231
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,990
row columns equals n
let's get in the first first element

232
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
let's get in the first first element
 

233
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,990
let's get in the first first element
and the same if zero equals columns

234
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
and the same if zero equals columns
 

235
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,430
and the same if zero equals columns
return first

236
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440

 

237
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,950

okay now let's the interesting part okay

238
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
okay now let's the interesting part okay
 

239
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,309
okay now let's the interesting part okay
so now we can say ah

240
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
so now we can say ah
 

241
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,430
so now we can say ah
equal uh let's let's um let's put it on

242
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
equal uh let's let's um let's put it on
 

243
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,309
equal uh let's let's um let's put it on
the top

244
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
the top
 

245
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:52,629
the top
right corner which is zero yeah

246
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639

 

247
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,710

minus one okay start with start with

248
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
minus one okay start with start with
 

249
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,670
minus one okay start with start with
zero

250
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
zero
 

251
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,950
zero
and then why why this location is still

252
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
and then why why this location is still
 

253
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,070
and then why why this location is still
in the metric yeah if

254
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
in the metric yeah if
 

255
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,550
in the metric yeah if
it's outside then we can't find it yeah

256
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
it's outside then we can't find it yeah
 

257
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,510
it's outside then we can't find it yeah
we don't find it

258
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
we don't find it
 

259
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,950
we don't find it
so y r is smaller than rows

260
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
so y r is smaller than rows
 

261
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,589
so y r is smaller than rows
yeah and column is bigger or equal than

262
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
yeah and column is bigger or equal than
 

263
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,309
yeah and column is bigger or equal than
zero

264
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
zero
 

265
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,830
zero
where this location is still in the

266
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840
where this location is still in the
 

267
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,710
where this location is still in the
metric if

268
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
metric if
 

269
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,990
metric if
okay you tell me okay if metric

270
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
okay you tell me okay if metric
 

271
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,189
okay you tell me okay if metric
ah c equals

272
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
ah c equals
 

273
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,589
ah c equals
t what's what's your idea

274
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
t what's what's your idea
 

275
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:39,749
t what's what's your idea
what's your identity

276
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759

 

277
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,950

if the t is bigger than if t

278
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
if the t is bigger than if t
 

279
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,029
if the t is bigger than if t
is bigger than that element so we should

280
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
is bigger than that element so we should
 

281
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,150
is bigger than that element so we should
go no

282
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
go no
 

283
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,189
go no
we should we should go down remember

284
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
we should we should go down remember
 

285
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,670
we should we should go down remember
remember we should go down which we

286
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
remember we should go down which we
 

287
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,230
remember we should go down which we
should

288
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
should
 

289
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,430
should
should i do so i equals plus equals one

290
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
should i do so i equals plus equals one
 

291
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,749
should i do so i equals plus equals one
if is smaller then we move right how how

292
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
if is smaller then we move right how how
 

293
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,510
if is smaller then we move right how how
can we move right

294
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
can we move right
 

295
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,469
can we move right
how can we move right yeah how can we

296
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
how can we move right yeah how can we
 

297
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:02,869
how can we move right yeah how can we
move

298
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
move
 

299
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,390
move
right okay how can we move left

300
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
right okay how can we move left
 

301
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,749
right okay how can we move left
c move left columns

302
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
c move left columns
 

303
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,110
c move left columns
move left left c minus equals one

304
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
move left left c minus equals one
 

305
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,909
move left left c minus equals one
one yeah and then after this

306
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919

 

307
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:34,389

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,269
okay so let's go through it again this
is the blue force we go through each

508
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
is the blue force we go through each
 

509
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,269
is the blue force we go through each
element in a metric that takes

510
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
element in a metric that takes
 

511
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,389
element in a metric that takes
an o m times n right

512
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
an o m times n right
 

513
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,509
an o m times n right
and this one takes all m plus

514
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
and this one takes all m plus
 

515
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,550
and this one takes all m plus
n because we we at most we are visiting

516
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
n because we we at most we are visiting
 

517
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,230
n because we we at most we are visiting
m plus n elements in the metric

518
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240
m plus n elements in the metric
 

519
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,949
m plus n elements in the metric
right depending on which comparison of

520
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
right depending on which comparison of
 

521
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,790
right depending on which comparison of
this value if it's the same

522
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
this value if it's the same
 

523
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,470
this value if it's the same
then we found the target if it's bigger

524
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
then we found the target if it's bigger
 

525
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,590
then we found the target if it's bigger
than the current cell in the magic we go

526
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
than the current cell in the magic we go
 

527
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,710
than the current cell in the magic we go
down because it can't

528
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
down because it can't
 

529
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,949
down because it can't
be on the right left hand side all right

530
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
be on the right left hand side all right
 

531
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,710
be on the right left hand side all right
we can go down right

532
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
we can go down right
 

533
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,710
we can go down right
yeah otherwise we go left and return

534
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
yeah otherwise we go left and return
 

535
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,829
yeah otherwise we go left and return
force okay

536
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839
force okay
 

537
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,250
force okay
any questions so far

538
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:14,260
any questions so far
 

539
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,910
any questions so far
