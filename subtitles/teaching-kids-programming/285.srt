1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,359
hello

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:08,559
hello mr mr ryan how are you today

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,320
so remember uh how to reverse a sentence

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,799
a string remember how to reverse the

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,160
center it's very simple yeah

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,679
reverse

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,039
reverse the string how do you reverse

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,199
the string come on

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,199
um

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,800
and how do we reverse it in position

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,920
column column minus one yeah yeah

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,239
we want to implement that reverse how

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,160
can we reverse it look if this is

14
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:41,440
e-i-i-c-a like how do you reverse it you

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,760
become m-c-r-i-r-a

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,520
okay so how do we reverse this

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,000
how do we reverse this bit

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,600
we just use the two-pointer two-pointer

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,120
yeah pointing to the left and front in

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,360
the right remember

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,440
yeah and swapping this you become

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,000
c-r-i-e and then we move it

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,160
towards each other yeah and not stop it

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
as long as the two meet two pointers one

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,199
meeting each other right so it becomes

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,479
gi

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,680
uh okay

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,760
okay so today's task is quite similar so

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,760
we want to reverse the

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,680
only letters only the letters in the

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,640
string so for example like uh

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,000
uh

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,520
a b

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,520
a b dash

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,040
dot c d and

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,479
we want to reverse it it will become

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,040
what

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,040
we'll be coming

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,560
okay so it's similar so for example e

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,439
eric

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,380
uh

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,440
eric

43
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,440
[Music]

44
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,280
[Music]

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,560
we want to reverse this bit yeah so we

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,360
want to reverse this bit so look at me

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,959
okay

48
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,800
i if i change it here to e and i put it

49
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,280
here and right

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,160
but these i want to keep it in place and

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,959
ah

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,520
i will swap with a right

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,520
so a

54
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,080
so every noun lowercase character we

55
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,760
just keep it right and then ask what we

56
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,560
see

57
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,519
okay

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,040
so what just happened

59
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,280
backwards what just happened these these

60
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,280
this

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,770
lowercase character or state assignment

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,440
all our lowercase uh

63
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,440
[Music]

64
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,239
you know the english letters will be

65
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,840
swapped okay we'll be reversed correct

66
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,319
yeah yeah

67
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,599
so how do we do this how do we do this

68
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,840
we use

69
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,680
of course yeah yeah we use the two

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,010
points but we need to add one more

71
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,200
object we want to skip the noun

72
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,200
[Music]

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,959
english letters right we want to skip

74
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,319
the non-english letter

75
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,959
okay

76
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,159
so look look can you can you yeah so it

77
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,400
should be as i demonstrated so when we

78
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,760
have this note i

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
uh when we

80
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,239
we will skip

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,319
the non-english letters until we have

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,400
the english letters and then we have

83
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,159
still have two pointers thingy and we

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,239
swap it and then we

85
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,879
move two pointers towards each other

86
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,280
until they meet in the middle right yeah

87
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,720
so this is the only trick right let's

88
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,640
define

89
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,000
reverse

90
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,000
only letters yeah

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,319
yeah

92
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
s

93
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,360
okay

94
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,720
so the left to right i

95
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,000
j at the beginning will become zero to

96
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,280
length s right minus one right okay

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
yeah

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,200
i

99
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,000
the left pointer j the rightmost pointer

100
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,680
is the length as the size of the s minus

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,760
one okay look

102
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,760
wire

103
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,120
am smaller than j right when these two

104
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,959
pointers are not meeting each other in

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,680
the middle right okay

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,360
so now we want to skip that pointer

107
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,759
until we meet

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,880
the english letter right

109
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,479
alphabet so look how do we check if it's

110
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,199
a letter in

111
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,040
a

112
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,280
character is alphabet

113
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,479
right any idea

114
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,240
what's called f alphabet a

115
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,360
to z lowercase

116
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,800
o

117
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,360
a to z uppercase right

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,960
yes yeah

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,600
so how do we check it we can just check

120
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,600
okay okay we can check we receive bc

121
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,720
equals s i right

122
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,199
right

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,520
yeah and we can just check look we can

124
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,440
do what if c

125
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,919
if c

126
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,880
if we see right if a small you can write

127
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,840
it if a is smaller than z and c

128
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,800
smaller equals z

129
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,720
i or

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,759
like oh using more right

131
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,960
a

132
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,440
bigger c

133
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,800
smaller than bigger z yeah

134
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,800
this is one way to do it right

135
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,800
yeah

136
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,840
what's the ascii code of a come on

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,280
what's the ascii code of a

138
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,080
what's this

139
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,120
what

140
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,039
is 96 no

141
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,800
why every time you remember 96 97

142
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,680
what's this

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,880
um 65 whatever

144
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,240
so you another way is you can say if all

145
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,800
all the other these yeah or the bc is

146
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,520
this is the number you can say is bigger

147
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,000
than 97 and smaller than what what's

148
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,360
this what's this if this is 97 what's

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the d

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,000
what's the z

151
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,479
what's the z if this is

152
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,199
yes 26 26 minus one

153
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,440
okay that's one way one another way

154
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,000
of checking this is using a function

155
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,720
which is very similar which one

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,880
if look if c is this yeah you can say if

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
c

158
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,960
that's it that would be the same thing

159
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,960
as checking if this

160
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,160
is character between a to z okay

161
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,440
lowercase or and all uppercase right so

162
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,639
let's so we want to skip the

163
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,639
the look uh we want to skip the num

164
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
alpha letters yes

165
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,199
we want to skip the num alpha letters

166
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,120
yes so hopefully we do this

167
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,840
we can do another wire

168
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,440
wire i smaller than j

169
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,960
and

170
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,479
not

171
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,160
a i

172
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,160
s i

173
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,319
dot is alpha right

174
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,680
uh it's alpha to what i know what should

175
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,479
we do i

176
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,919
if me if i is smaller than j

177
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,120
n

178
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,160
s i is not alpha letter now we want to i

179
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,039
know

180
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,880
equal one okay and another one we want

181
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,880
to move the right product so can you

182
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,039
tell me similarly

183
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,039
y

184
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,080
i smaller than j

185
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,000
and what

186
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:50,479
and not what s z

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,479
dot is alpha right it's the same yeah

188
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,319
after this problem what's happening i

189
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,479
and j pointing to the

190
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,919
english letter right pointing to for

191
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,319
example this is e

192
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,120
right maybe some here and then this this

193
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,680
is r maybe here yeah pointing to some

194
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,599
characters and now what do we need to do

195
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,879
what do we need to do

196
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,879
what do we need to do with this

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,360
how do we swap the characters and s i

198
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,520
this is s i and this is s j how do you

199
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,680
swap

200
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,520
we it a new thing

201
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,759
you can do it but in person you can do

202
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,800
it you know how to describe it's like a

203
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,800
d copy thing

204
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,490
a equals one b equals to how can we swap

205
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:50,909
a and b

206
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:50,909

oh

[Music]

210
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,880
what do we need to do now if i swap the

211
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,399
si and sj what do we need to do now

212
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,000
um we need to

213
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,160
we need to keep moving towards your

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,399
let's say what

215
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,320
i

216
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,000
plus equals one

217
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,040
and

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,040
j minus

219
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,000
okay so this s is is a string we can't

220
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,720
do this because string is immutable so

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,760
how can we do this we can do this uh we

222
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,600
can put a uh

223
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,240
answer equals we can break it into uh uh

224
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,080
an array right list s

225
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,560
right and now

226
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,720
it's okay here then we can do this

227
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,320
instead of s we do this answer okay

228
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,480
let's just put it a

229
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,600
a equals a

230
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,640
we swap it a or a is an array

231
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,560
right we we we can do this a or x it

232
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,839
doesn't matter again here and then we

233
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,839
turn one we can join

234
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,480
[Music]

235
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,560
join a right now

236
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,560
okay what's the time complexity come on

237
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,200
the letters this is the number of the

238
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,640
number of letters in the string

239
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,000
yeah what's the space complexity

240
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,560
look we are if we're using the list here

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,200
oh n yes or n because look

242
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,079
in a string look if a equal

243
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,200
look if a equals eric right this is a

244
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,440
string string immutable what's immutable

245
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,160
you can't change it so it means that i

246
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,360
can't do with i can't i can't a zero

247
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,279
equals

248
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,760
x i come to this right look i can't

249
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,320
change it because string is immutable so

250
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,519
that's why i need to do this list as

251
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,920
what's this as to break the string into

252
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,120
internal array so what what's that look

253
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,279
alright look

254
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,079
so this this uh area what does it give

255
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,880
us

256
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,920
what's uh this area you give us one and

257
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,839
the list brackets the bracket of

258
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,640
each character e

259
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,640
ah i

260
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,839
and c right if it's a list then i can

261
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,040
change it right i can swap it i know i'm

262
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,880
just swapping i use what which one

263
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,839
i can join

264
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,839

j

271
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,680
minus equal one

272
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,200
okay and at least at last we want to

273
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,440
convert a to a string

274
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,519
we tend what how do we

275
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,279
return uh these in the dream return

276
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,600
return

what's this one here what's here

that mean the last question what's this

282
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,920
mean

283
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,320
it's alpha what does it mean

284
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,320
string

e

286
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,959
what does it

287
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,399
can you tell me what's these two the

288
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,399

there are two votes that's it yeah if

291
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,720
not if it's not an english letter we

292
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,480
keep incrementing it look moving

293
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,079
and if you're not implementing uh if

294
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,279
it's not ingredients that i would keep

295
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:37,800
going there okay what you're doing
