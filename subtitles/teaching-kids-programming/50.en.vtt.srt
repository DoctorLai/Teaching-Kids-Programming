mr ryan hello this is the teacher yeah
we're done today okay so today we're

8
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
we're done today okay so today we're
 

9
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,910
we're done today okay so today we're
going to learn a little bit about

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
going to learn a little bit about
 

11
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,589
going to learn a little bit about
these mathematics we're going to talk

12
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
these mathematics we're going to talk
 

13
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,710
these mathematics we're going to talk
about this pythagorean theorem

14
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
about this pythagorean theorem
 

15
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,150
about this pythagorean theorem
okay yeah pythagorean zero so

16
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,160
okay yeah pythagorean zero so
 

17
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,710
okay yeah pythagorean zero so
if you really want to know in short that

18
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
if you really want to know in short that
 

19
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,830
if you really want to know in short that
percentage theorem

20
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
percentage theorem
 

21
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,189
percentage theorem
is it means a 12 plus b

22
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
is it means a 12 plus b
 

23
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,349
is it means a 12 plus b
squared equals c squared easy to

24
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
squared equals c squared easy to
 

25
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,790
squared equals c squared easy to
remember right

26
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
remember right
 

27
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,270
remember right
yes so what does it mean it means look

28
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
yes so what does it mean it means look
 

29
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,549
yes so what does it mean it means look
we talked about a little bit

30
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
we talked about a little bit
 

31
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,150
we talked about a little bit
yesterday a right triangle if this is 90

32
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
yesterday a right triangle if this is 90
 

33
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,270
yesterday a right triangle if this is 90
degree

34
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
degree
 

35
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,549
degree
okay if this side is a this side is b

36
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
okay if this side is a this side is b
 

37
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,430
okay if this side is a this side is b
and this side is c so a square plus b

38
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
and this side is c so a square plus b
 

39
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,190
and this side is c so a square plus b
squared equals c squared for example a

40
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
squared equals c squared for example a
 

41
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,869
squared equals c squared for example a
equals three

42
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
equals three
 

43
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,150
equals three
b is four and then a c is five okay

44
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
b is four and then a c is five okay
 

45
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,510
b is four and then a c is five okay
so how do we get these how this is quite

46
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
so how do we get these how this is quite
 

47
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,790
so how do we get these how this is quite
magic right

48
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
magic right
 

49
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,189
magic right
it's look if it's a right triangle and

50
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
it's look if it's a right triangle and
 

51
00:00:59,199 --> 00:00:59,990
it's look if it's a right triangle and
it's you know

52
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
it's you know
 

53
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,270
it's you know
both sides you know any two sides yeah

54
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
both sides you know any two sides yeah
 

55
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,109
both sides you know any two sides yeah
if you're not a c if you know the a you

56
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
if you're not a c if you know the a you
 

57
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,469
if you're not a c if you know the a you
can know b right

58
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
can know b right
 

59
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,350
can know b right
you can calculate the other side given

60
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
you can calculate the other side given
 

61
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,149
you can calculate the other side given
two sides

62
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
two sides
 

63
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,950
two sides
so why why is this this is very

64
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
so why why is this this is very
 

65
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,630
so why why is this this is very
important okay very very important

66
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
important okay very very important
 

67
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,590
important okay very very important
mathematic

68
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
mathematic
 

69
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,310
mathematic
called pythagorean serum okay so how do

70
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
called pythagorean serum okay so how do
 

71
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,510
called pythagorean serum okay so how do
we get that

72
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
we get that
 

73
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,749
we get that
look so this is the triangle uh

74
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
look so this is the triangle uh
 

75
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,630
look so this is the triangle uh
this is a triangle nice taste in my

76
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
this is a triangle nice taste in my
 

77
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,230
this is a triangle nice taste in my
mouth

78
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
mouth
 

79
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,590
mouth
why is that i just feel this taste

80
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
why is that i just feel this taste
 

81
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,749
why is that i just feel this taste
okay so this is triangle and then right

82
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
okay so this is triangle and then right
 

83
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,630
okay so this is triangle and then right
angled

84
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
angled
 

85
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,910
angled
yeah so now um actually let me draw it

86
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
yeah so now um actually let me draw it
 

87
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,030
yeah so now um actually let me draw it
the other way okay so it's better okay

88
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
the other way okay so it's better okay
 

89
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,429
the other way okay so it's better okay
okay so look these

90
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
okay so look these
 

91
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,069
okay so look these
yeah one triangle this is the this and

92
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
yeah one triangle this is the this and
 

93
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,590
yeah one triangle this is the this and
then we can draw another one

94
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600

 

95
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,109

another one how to draw uh another one

96
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
another one how to draw uh another one
 

97
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:11,830
another one how to draw uh another one
yeah let me draw how hot it is

98
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840

 

99
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,949

i'm the coding teacher okay so roughly

100
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
i'm the coding teacher okay so roughly
 

101
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:15,910
i'm the coding teacher okay so roughly
like that okay

102
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
like that okay
 

103
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,229
like that okay
so this four triangle yeah oh you need

104
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
so this four triangle yeah oh you need
 

105
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,110
so this four triangle yeah oh you need
it yeah

106
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
it yeah
 

107
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,430
it yeah
yeah this is water

108
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440

 

109
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,790

this is look this this is if the longer

110
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
this is look this this is if the longer
 

111
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,430
this is look this this is if the longer
side

112
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
side
 

113
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,550
side
is if the longer side is b okay

114
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
is if the longer side is b okay
 

115
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,910
is if the longer side is b okay
if if look if longer side is b and then

116
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
if if look if longer side is b and then
 

117
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,630
if if look if longer side is b and then
smaller size a and this is c okay so

118
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
smaller size a and this is c okay so
 

119
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,350
smaller size a and this is c okay so
this is c

120
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
this is c
 

121
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,869
this is c
right this is c this c yeah yeah

122
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
right this is c this c yeah yeah
 

123
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,390
right this is c this c yeah yeah
yeah so that so this the the area

124
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
yeah so that so this the the area
 

125
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,830
yeah so that so this the the area
the size of the big square is what

126
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840

 

127
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,270

c this fixing

128
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
c this fixing
 

129
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,150
c this fixing
c square and what does it equal does it

130
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
c square and what does it equal does it
 

131
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,110
c square and what does it equal does it
equal that

132
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
equal that
 

133
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,270
equal that
i sum up with the four terms of these

134
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
i sum up with the four terms of these
 

135
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,509
i sum up with the four terms of these
yes yeah

136
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
yes yeah
 

137
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,470
yes yeah
and plus this one okay all right so four

138
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
and plus this one okay all right so four
 

139
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,390
and plus this one okay all right so four
times

140
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
times
 

141
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,869
times
the size of these the area size of the

142
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
the size of these the area size of the
 

143
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,070
the size of these the area size of the
triangle

how big is this is it equals two half

146
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
how big is this is it equals two half
 

147
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,670
how big is this is it equals two half
half of a times b right yeah

148
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
half of a times b right yeah
 

149
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,190
half of a times b right yeah
and how many of them how many of these

right so this is
 

169
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,589
right so this is
b minus a right b minus

170
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
b minus a right b minus
 

171
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,350
b minus a right b minus
a square yeah

172
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
a square yeah
 

173
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,670
a square yeah
okay so look this is 2 a b

174
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
okay so look this is 2 a b
 

175
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,949
okay so look this is 2 a b
right and then plus b

176
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
right and then plus b
 

177
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,390
right and then plus b
minus a squared is b squared

178
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
minus a squared is b squared
 

179
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,789
minus a squared is b squared
plus a squared minus 2 times a b ba okay

180
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
plus a squared minus 2 times a b ba okay
 

181
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,070
plus a squared minus 2 times a b ba okay
do you notice 2a b minus 2ab

182
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
do you notice 2a b minus 2ab
 

183
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,270
do you notice 2a b minus 2ab
it cancels out right yeah

184
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
it cancels out right yeah
 

185
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,789
it cancels out right yeah
so what's this b squared plus a squared

186
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
so what's this b squared plus a squared
 

187
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,830
so what's this b squared plus a squared
we just prove it c squared equals b

188
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
we just prove it c squared equals b
 

189
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,670
we just prove it c squared equals b
plus b squared plus a squared okay

190
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
plus b squared plus a squared okay
 

191
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,790
plus b squared plus a squared okay
or a squared plus b squared okay so

192
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
or a squared plus b squared okay so
 

193
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,390
or a squared plus b squared okay so
this is very interesting this is the

194
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
this is very interesting this is the
 

195
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,230
this is very interesting this is the
very important mathematics

196
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
very important mathematics
 

197
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,830
very important mathematics
so now now if i give you a value

198
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
so now now if i give you a value
 

199
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,909
so now now if i give you a value
c if i give you a value c

200
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
c if i give you a value c
 

201
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,469
c if i give you a value c
and i want you to write a program using

202
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
and i want you to write a program using
 

203
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,189
and i want you to write a program using
python

204
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
python
 

205
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,510
python
to to list all these kind of pairs

206
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
to to list all these kind of pairs
 

207
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,790
to to list all these kind of pairs
all the preserving theorem pairs

208
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
all the preserving theorem pairs
 

209
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,150
all the preserving theorem pairs
so for example i give you five right

210
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
so for example i give you five right
 

211
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,749
so for example i give you five right
yeah you should tell me you should print

212
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
yeah you should tell me you should print
 

213
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,510
yeah you should tell me you should print
3 square plus e

214
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
3 square plus e
 

215
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,310
3 square plus e
4 squared equals 5 squared if i give you

216
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
4 squared equals 5 squared if i give you
 

217
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,070
4 squared equals 5 squared if i give you
10

218
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
10
 

219
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,790
10
you should give me 6 square plus a

220
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
you should give me 6 square plus a
 

221
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,350
you should give me 6 square plus a
squared equals 10 squared

222
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
squared equals 10 squared
 

223
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,110
squared equals 10 squared
any idea how to do it

224
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
any idea how to do it
 

225
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,189
any idea how to do it
do you know how hot we do this we know

226
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
do you know how hot we do this we know
 

227
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,790
do you know how hot we do this we know
that c right

228
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
that c right
 

229
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,990
that c right
yes and what's the range we can we can

230
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
yes and what's the range we can we can
 

231
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,990
yes and what's the range we can we can
ask computer to try every number

232
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
ask computer to try every number
 

233
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,469
ask computer to try every number
a from one right

234
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
a from one right
 

235
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,510
a from one right
to c to c not not including c

236
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
to c to c not not including c
 

237
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,629
to c to c not not including c
but if if we we say if

238
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
but if if we we say if
 

239
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,749
but if if we we say if
a is strictly smaller than equal b

240
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
a is strictly smaller than equal b
 

241
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,070
a is strictly smaller than equal b
right yeah so we we start from one

242
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
right yeah so we we start from one
 

243
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,590
right yeah so we we start from one
once we we determine once the a is fixed

244
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
once we we determine once the a is fixed
 

245
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,950
once we we determine once the a is fixed
so what's the b b square

246
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
so what's the b b square
 

247
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,469
so what's the b b square
equals one c square minus

248
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
equals one c square minus
 

249
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,510
equals one c square minus
a we're done so c we know one yeah we

250
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
a we're done so c we know one yeah we
 

251
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:53,830
a we're done so c we know one yeah we
know

252
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
know
 

253
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,110
know
right yeah a is fixed once we know it's

254
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
right yeah a is fixed once we know it's
 

255
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,550
right yeah a is fixed once we know it's
one then we can calculate b

256
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
one then we can calculate b
 

257
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,990
one then we can calculate b
square right so look if b

258
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
square right so look if b
 

259
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,870
square right so look if b
is b if it's bigger or equal a so b

260
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
is b if it's bigger or equal a so b
 

261
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,590
is b if it's bigger or equal a so b
squared

262
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
squared
 

263
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,830
squared
is also bigger or a equals a squared

264
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
is also bigger or a equals a squared
 

265
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,629
is also bigger or a equals a squared
right

266
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
right
 

267
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,670
right
yes so leasing c squared minus a

268
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
yes so leasing c squared minus a
 

269
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,350
yes so leasing c squared minus a
squared bigger than a squared

270
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
squared bigger than a squared
 

271
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,469
squared bigger than a squared
so what does it mean c squared bigger

272
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
so what does it mean c squared bigger
 

273
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,629
so what does it mean c squared bigger
than 2 a squared right

274
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
than 2 a squared right
 

275
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,270
than 2 a squared right
yes so c squared is bigger than 2a

276
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
yes so c squared is bigger than 2a
 

277
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,830
yes so c squared is bigger than 2a
squared

278
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
squared
 

279
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,990
squared
so we can search these a

280
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
so we can search these a
 

281
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,510
so we can search these a
and here is bigger and here this

282
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
and here is bigger and here this
 

283
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,590
and here is bigger and here this
is not satisfied and after that

284
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
is not satisfied and after that
 

285
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,749
is not satisfied and after that
we can calculate b so once we know the b

286
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
we can calculate b so once we know the b
 

287
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,189
we can calculate b so once we know the b
square we need to check

288
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
square we need to check
 

289
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,110
square we need to check
if it's a perfect square number right

290
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
if it's a perfect square number right
 

291
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,830
if it's a perfect square number right
if b squared equals 15 do you think it's

292
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
if b squared equals 15 do you think it's
 

293
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,550
if b squared equals 15 do you think it's
a

294
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
a
 

295
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,629
a
we can find a b which is integer sum up

296
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
we can find a b which is integer sum up
 

297
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,670
we can find a b which is integer sum up
to

298
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
to
 

299
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,670
to
15 square to 15.

300
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680

 

301
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,950

no right because 16 is 50 it doesn't

302
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
no right because 16 is 50 it doesn't
 

303
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,510
no right because 16 is 50 it doesn't
have

304
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
have
 

305
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,950
have
any it's not 20 square okay so that's it

that's easy look let's define define
 

309
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,110
that's easy look let's define define
f c okay yeah

310
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
f c okay yeah
 

311
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,250
f c okay yeah
a equals one right

[Music]

314
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840

 

315
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,070

why

316
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080

 

317
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,270

we just know c square minus

318
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
we just know c square minus
 

319
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,909
we just know c square minus
a square is b square right

320
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
a square is b square right
 

321
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,270
a square is b square right
if c squared minus a square

322
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
if c squared minus a square
 

323
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,629
if c squared minus a square
is also bigger than a square bigger or

324
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
is also bigger than a square bigger or
 

325
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,309
is also bigger than a square bigger or
equal to a square right

326
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
equal to a square right
 

327
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,670
equal to a square right
yeah all right then

328
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
yeah all right then
 

329
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,870
yeah all right then
we need to b square b b2 let's say

330
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
we need to b square b b2 let's say
 

331
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,950
we need to b square b b2 let's say
b2 equals c squared minus a square right

332
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
b2 equals c squared minus a square right
 

333
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,749
b2 equals c squared minus a square right
now we need how can we check if b is a

334
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
now we need how can we check if b is a
 

335
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,270
now we need how can we check if b is a
perfect square number remember we use

336
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
perfect square number remember we use
 

337
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,710
perfect square number remember we use
the binary search but we can use the

338
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
the binary search but we can use the
 

339
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,510
the binary search but we can use the
built in

340
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
built in
 

341
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,070
built in
square number look b then is equals

342
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
square number look b then is equals
 

343
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,670
square number look b then is equals
let's let's do it sqrt remember

344
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
let's let's do it sqrt remember
 

345
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,230
let's let's do it sqrt remember
b square but we have to convert it to

346
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
b square but we have to convert it to
 

347
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,510
b square but we have to convert it to
the integer power

348
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
the integer power
 

349
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,869
the integer power
right if it's integer then we check if b

350
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
right if it's integer then we check if b
 

351
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,230
right if it's integer then we check if b
times b if it's equals b

352
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
times b if it's equals b
 

353
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,430
times b if it's equals b
square right now we can we know

354
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
square right now we can we know
 

355
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,629
square right now we can we know
twin a b c right

356
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
twin a b c right
 

357
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,749
twin a b c right
a b c okay yeah

358
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
a b c okay yeah
 

359
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,950
a b c okay yeah
yeah should we try it on the computer

360
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
yeah should we try it on the computer
 

361
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,390
yeah should we try it on the computer
to get it so basically we given c

362
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
to get it so basically we given c
 

363
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,589
to get it so basically we given c
so we just try a from one to

364
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
so we just try a from one to
 

365
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,310
so we just try a from one to
this yeah a range and once we know a we

366
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
this yeah a range and once we know a we
 

367
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,509
this yeah a range and once we know a we
know c

368
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
know c
 

369
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,550
know c
now we can calculate b but but we need

370
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
now we can calculate b but but we need
 

371
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,350
now we can calculate b but but we need
to make sure b

372
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
to make sure b
 

373
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,149
to make sure b
is the perfect square am right all right

374
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
is the perfect square am right all right
 

375
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,070
is the perfect square am right all right
yeah because if it's not perfect square

376
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
yeah because if it's not perfect square
 

377
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,829
yeah because if it's not perfect square
it doesn't it's not a pine sun green

378
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
it doesn't it's not a pine sun green
 

379
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,110
it doesn't it's not a pine sun green
theorem okay yeah you know how to say

fc yeah remember
 

429
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,030
fc yeah remember
yeah so a will start for one right

430
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
yeah so a will start for one right
 

431
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,630
yeah so a will start for one right
yeah y c

yeah y c
 

433
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,230
yeah y c
times c minus a times a is bigger than

434
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
times c minus a times a is bigger than
 

435
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,949
times c minus a times a is bigger than
or equal to

436

or equal to
 

437
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,230
or equal to
a times a right yes so this can sum up

438
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
a times a right yes so this can sum up
 

439
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,590
a times a right yes so this can sum up
to list so many

440

you sit down please

448
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
you sit down please
 

449
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,829
you sit down please
people are not seeing me please okay and

450
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
people are not seeing me please okay and
 

451
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,750
people are not seeing me please okay and
then what what

452
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
then what what
 

453
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,190
then what what
what b square equals c times c

454
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
what b square equals c times c
 

455
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,550
what b square equals c times c
minus a times a right yeah

456
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
minus a times a right yeah
 

457
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,790
minus a times a right yeah
and now we need to try to calculate b

458
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
and now we need to try to calculate b
 

459
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,829
and now we need to try to calculate b
value which is

460
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
value which is
 

461
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,190
value which is
integer of sqrt squared

462
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
integer of sqrt squared
 

463
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,829
integer of sqrt squared
b2 right but in order to use this as

464
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
b2 right but in order to use this as
 

465
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,389
b2 right but in order to use this as
square function we have to import them

466
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
square function we have to import them
 

467
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,550
square function we have to import them
in max imported function from the math

468
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
in max imported function from the math
 

469
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,630
in max imported function from the math
module okay then

470
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
module okay then
 

471
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,710
module okay then
now we we have to check if b times b

472
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
now we we have to check if b times b
 

473
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,790
now we we have to check if b times b
is b what is p2 right

474
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
is b what is p2 right
 

475
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,509
is b what is p2 right
now we find it we find this uh we can

476
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
now we find it we find this uh we can
 

477
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,430
now we find it we find this uh we can
print we can do this

478
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
print we can do this
 

479
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,750
print we can do this
d uh we can print this d square

480
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
d uh we can print this d square
 

481
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,430
d uh we can print this d square
this is formatting okay don't worry too

482
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
this is formatting okay don't worry too
 

483
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,990
this is formatting okay don't worry too
much about it if you don't understand

484
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
much about it if you don't understand
 

485
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,190
much about it if you don't understand
where's d from d is means integer yeah

486
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
where's d from d is means integer yeah
 

487
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,030
where's d from d is means integer yeah
it's not it's a format then after that

488
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
it's not it's a format then after that
 

489
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,630
it's not it's a format then after that
we can please

490
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
we can please
 

491
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,150
we can please
in plug the value in okay then

in plug the value in okay then
 

493
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,069
in plug the value in okay then
let's try that's it uh we have to

494
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
let's try that's it uh we have to
 

495
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,150
let's try that's it uh we have to
