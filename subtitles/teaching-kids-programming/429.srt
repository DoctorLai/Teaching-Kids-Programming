1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
yo hello mr mr ryan i'm right okay so

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,200
today we'll talk about something very

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,120
fundamental very basic

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,200
path by variance reference or object

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,000
reference so what does it mean so let's

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,199
say if i define the function f

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,560
and i put a value x here right yeah and

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,240
i want to say x equals one right come on

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,039
yeah

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,920
yeah so look at this i have a defined

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,840
function we take a parameter but inside

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,719
if i say x equals 1 what happened here

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,960
everybody look so if i have these x

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,200
defined outside the scalable function i

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,160
say x equals 2

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,000
and then i call this function x x and i

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,200
put in the x can you tell me what what's

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,160
the value of x come on look

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,680
so

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,840
i define the red

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,160
variable x equals 2

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,640
and i call this function

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,399
which change the value x equals 1 and

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,440
then i put in the x what's the value

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,440
what's the

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,480
what's the result x

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,040
ryan

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,799
what's the result right uh what's what's

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
the result guess

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,040
two

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
your case is two what's your guess look

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,520
i haven't defined the value

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,680
but i change i call it f x

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,000
inside your change x equals one i print

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,680
x so what happened

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,479
u two x

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,720
three

38
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,840
the y is the switch x one

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,840
x equals one

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,360
one or two yeah i know it's one of two

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
guess

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,880
or your chain i mean i haven't talked

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
about this before yes don't worry just

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,360
learn them again

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,200
it's not one okay two yeah two two is

46
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,200
the right one why is that that means

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,799
let me

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,680
explain this okay i have two sets of

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,640
data here so what one is immutable

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,520
what's immutable

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,040
immutable multiple and the other one is

52
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,520
mutable the uh the data type immediately

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,119
quiet what is immutable

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,520
what is it beautiful can't keep quiet

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,399
no no what's immutable what's new about

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,160
come on

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,400
mutable is

58
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,440
change mutable is changeable by the way

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,239
it's changeable yes chen this is change

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,160
but

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:25,280
by this one kang chang right kang

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,239
so we have immutable like the integer

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,959
the integer the float

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,800
okay some sometimes the strings yes

65
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,319
strings are immutable

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,599
the sets uh the the set goes to the

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,680
multiple yeah and the list here

68
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:48,000
string and what else topper yeah pepper

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,599
yeah and then dictionary transition

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,160
these are changeable yeah this year and

71
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,400
set the other the other one is frozen

72
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,120
set you have frozen set frozen means

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,040
that

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,800
this set is

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,800
is uh spidey array yeah it's unbeatable

76
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,720
yeah

77
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
right and this here will be bites away

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,080
okay

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,720
and then i'll be complex here okay

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,239
okay so if this is

81
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,400
immutable

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,239
so as immutable means you can't change

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,360
right basically so everything you change

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,760
here

85
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,159
can't affect anything outside so because

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,120
it's immutable so at least you can think

87
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,120
of this x is a individual copy yeah it's

88
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,879
not the same copy as this

89
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,599
it's not the same x

90
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,440
so

91
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,159
no matter what you change inside doesn't

92
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,120
affect anything else so that's two okay

93
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,920
how about if i have this define

94
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,159
f

95
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,200
let's say i choose something from here

96
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,159
which is changeable let's say a list x

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,480
and then x dot append

98
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,400
it's a list i append the

99
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,120
number five okay

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,120
and then at the beginning x equals one

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,000
two three four

102
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,599
and then if we call this f x what i'm

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,319
doing the x

104
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,840
what do you think x will be

105
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,560
okay so this is com this x is one three

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,479
four five exactly yeah because this x

107
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,280
list is

108
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,919
changeable mutable so i pass the x to

109
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,639
this function whatever

110
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,800
changes in this x it means the same

111
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,120
right x apparently said i mean at 5

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
that's a very good job yeah okay so okay

113
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,919
so

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,080
look if so

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,560
to sum up the price and use the option

116
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,960
reference if it's immutable right you

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,280
pass a another individual copy if it's a

118
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,639
mute button pass the same copy so when

119
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,960
you pass the

120
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,080
immutable when you pass the separate

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,199
copy yeah it's actually passed by values

122
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,520
values means that a clone a value of it

123
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,919
but reference is like

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,680
the same copy yeah same copy so for

125
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,320
example if i call you

126
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,600
ryan yeah ryan lie

127
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,600
or i call you holzer like

128
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,400
means the same people right

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,360
yeah ryan lie yeah can you go brush your

130

okay so this

150
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,199
is my hair is not that long

151
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,199
okay

152
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
uh another thing another thing another

153
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,280
thing i want to talk about is this if i

154
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,039
want to change this let's say look i

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,479
have another thing okay another thing

156
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,120
define

157
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,280
f without function without anything if i

158
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
said x equals one

159
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,000
i i haven't part i haven't

160
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,319
given it a parameter so if i have x

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,199
equals two here i call this f

162
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,360
and point x

163
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,840
so what's the result

164
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,199
what's the result come on

165
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,600
look now

166
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,560
this x comes from nowhere

167
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,560
okay

168
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,199
so i haven't passed this x to it so

169
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,000
obviously this x and this x

170
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,639
it's not the same thing so you'll be

171
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,440
2 right so if i want to say because this

172
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,759
x leaves inside the locus goal of the

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,000
function this x is different than x x if

174
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,039
i want to say this x is the same i have

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,360
to

176
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,240
declare say global

177
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,440
global x so when i put this global x

178
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,360
what does it mean

179
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,919
it means this x

180
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,800
is the x outside so when i print when i

181
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,199
do this x will be equal to one okay

182
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,319
yeah okay so we talked about this the

183
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,000
frozen set is the the immutable version

184
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,560
of a set

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,639
uh the complex yeah we don't want to

186
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,680
talk about these because this mathematic

187
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,680
this is

188
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,960
a bit complex they're complex numbers

189
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,880
when you get older yeah when you let you

190
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,319
get you will learn the complex numbers

191
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,000
okay so we're not talking about that

192
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,080
today the bytes

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,080
buys and buys away okay buys a buyer

194
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,319
basically each byte is 255

195
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,880
feet okay a bite is 259 bits so we can

196
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,240
declare as bite

197
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,240
yeah buys

198
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,000
i mean i don't know

199
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,680
97 98.99

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,520
so now this corresponds to a b c okay

201
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,520
when you declare spikes it's not

202
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,720
changeable you can't say okay this is x

203
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,160
equals 5 don't say x 1 equals something

204
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,400
it doesn't work

205
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,160
but by its array we can declare it by

206
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,599
the way so it's it's

207
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,759
it's uh it's actually a list yeah this

208
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,360
array so we can change it right so this

209
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,160
is by the way

210
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,759
okay

211
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,330
yeah so what have you learned today

212
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,360
right about

213
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,360
[Music]

214
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,599
let's say

215
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,800
s

216
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,319
is

217
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
x okay then

218
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,959
we have x equals

219
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,039
uh

220
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:42,719
5 6 7 and then x equals

221
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,360
one two three so print x is it one two

222
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,920
three or five two five six seven oh

223
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,440
x equals couple one two three and a pass

224
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,560
to f uh x equals five six seven so

225
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,720
what's x

226
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
what

227
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,000
uh yes why why is that because you can't

228
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,279
change because you can't change

229
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,320
we can't yeah because this is tupperware

230
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,320
how do you pronounce this one

231
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,160
is immutable we can't change it when we

232
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,080
can't change it

233
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,600
everything inside the function is a

234
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,000
separate copy because we can't change

235
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,959
the thing outside right but if it's a

236
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,360
changeable like uh at least

237
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,080
look look eric you missed this bit look

238
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,120
if it's x the x is the least yeah this

239
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,720
is changeable so x dot appends five when

240
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,120
we pass one two three four x is

241
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,519
changeable it will be zero five got it

242
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,480
so it's passed by object reference when

243
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,720
it's mutable it will be changed you only

244
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,800
do this it will be changeable

245
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,200
when it's immutable so everything inside

246
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,399
this function is a separate copy right

247
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,279
yeah part path by value

248
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,399
pass by value is like uh uh

249
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,279
the pass by value yeah it's like uh

250
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,760
what's this okay so this is uh

251
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,680
this is a cube yeah present value it

252
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,480
will be separate copy

253
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,959
the same separate copy right yeah but

254
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,279
pass by reference is not that's what i'm

255
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,800
saying ryan this is ryan

256
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,800
although houston is ryan

257
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,800
i've asked ryan

258
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
to go to bust his teeth

259
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,920
that's not an excuse okay okay so uh

260
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,200
that will be for today so yeah that's it

261
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,200
bye-bye

262
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
bye
