remember yesterday we talked about how
 

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,670
remember yesterday we talked about how
to check if a string is a valid

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
to check if a string is a valid
 

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,029
to check if a string is a valid
parenthesis right yes how how about i

8
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
parenthesis right yes how how about i
 

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,230
parenthesis right yes how how about i
ask you this question how about if if i

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
ask you this question how about if if i
 

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,109
ask you this question how about if if i
given i

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
given i
 

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,150
given i
give a a string

14
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
give a a string
 

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,390
give a a string
which is contains the parenthesis and

16
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
which is contains the parenthesis and
 

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,189
which is contains the parenthesis and
tell me

18
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
tell me
 

19
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,709
tell me
how many how many uh brackets

20
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
how many how many uh brackets
 

21
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,430
how many how many uh brackets
or premises do you need to make to to to

22
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
or premises do you need to make to to to
 

23
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,190
or premises do you need to make to to to
put into the string to make it a

24
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
put into the string to make it a
 

25
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,830
put into the string to make it a
valid parenthesis for example like least

26
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
valid parenthesis for example like least
 

27
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,270
valid parenthesis for example like least
then you should give me zero because

28
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
then you should give me zero because
 

29
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,549
then you should give me zero because
it's already

30
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
it's already
 

31
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,029
it's already
valid parentheses and how about this you

32
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
valid parentheses and how about this you
 

33
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,670
valid parentheses and how about this you
should give me

34
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
should give me
 

35
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,590
should give me
two because you need to put one

um

92
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520

 

93
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,070

of course we keep a variable balance

94
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
of course we keep a variable balance
 

95
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,830
of course we keep a variable balance
yeah

96
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
yeah
 

97
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,350
yeah
to the b value because the

98
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
to the b value because the
 

99
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,670
to the b value because the
current number opening brackets

100
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
current number opening brackets
 

101
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,630
current number opening brackets
parenthesis

102
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
parenthesis
 

103
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,869
parenthesis
yeah okay so like look one yeah here

104
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
yeah okay so like look one yeah here
 

105
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,910
yeah okay so like look one yeah here
left bracket is one

106
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
left bracket is one
 

107
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,509
left bracket is one
opening parenthesis zero okay so that's

108
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
opening parenthesis zero okay so that's
 

109
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,390
opening parenthesis zero okay so that's
zero

110
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
zero
 

111
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,710
zero
how about this uh if i don't have left

112
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
how about this uh if i don't have left
 

113
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,790
how about this uh if i don't have left
okay so look

114
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
okay so look
 

115
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,830
okay so look
that's minus one right so if it's minus

116
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
that's minus one right so if it's minus
 

117
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,110
that's minus one right so if it's minus
one then i

118
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
one then i
 

119
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,309
one then i
how about i have uh that's only two

120
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
how about i have uh that's only two
 

121
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,949
how about i have uh that's only two
i know one here and then

122
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959

 

123
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,949

and then the balance will become

124
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
and then the balance will become
 

125
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,309
and then the balance will become
zero again and then this one is one okay

126
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
zero again and then this one is one okay
 

127
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,270
zero again and then this one is one okay
the end now we add one more because the

128
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
the end now we add one more because the
 

129
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,710
the end now we add one more because the
the current opening packet

130
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
the current opening packet
 

131
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,190
the current opening packet
is one so we add one more and hover

132
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
is one so we add one more and hover
 

133
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,589
is one so we add one more and hover
river

134
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
river
 

135
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,790
river
one zero

136
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
one zero
 

137
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,830
one zero
minus one yeah so we add one more yeah

138
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
minus one yeah so we add one more yeah
 

139
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,949
minus one yeah so we add one more yeah
one so to get it all you can do this uh

140
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
one so to get it all you can do this uh
 

141
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,110
one so to get it all you can do this uh
uh you can put this list well you can

142
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
uh you can put this list well you can
 

143
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,270
uh you can put this list well you can
put it here right it's the same yeah

144
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
put it here right it's the same yeah
 

145
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,869
put it here right it's the same yeah
yeah and how about this one

151
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,990

one right one and then you have one more

152
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
one right one and then you have one more
 

153
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,869

then you add
one how about this probably this is

156
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
one how about this probably this is
 

157
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,190
one how about this probably this is
interesting look

158
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
interesting look
 

159
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,309
interesting look
minus one yeah so every time we we find

160
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
minus one yeah so every time we we find
 

161
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,429
minus one yeah so every time we we find
it's negative we

162
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
it's negative we
 

163
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,509
it's negative we
add one here to the answer and then

164
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
add one here to the answer and then
 

165
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,869
add one here to the answer and then
one zero

166
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
one zero
 

167
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,710
one zero
yeah minus one and another one

168
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
yeah minus one and another one
 

169
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,429
yeah minus one and another one
when one is falling below the zero we

170
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
when one is falling below the zero we
 

171
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,550
when one is falling below the zero we
don't

172
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
don't
 

173
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,750
don't
increment we will make it zero uh we we

174
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
increment we will make it zero uh we we
 

175
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,350
increment we will make it zero uh we we
make it immediately zero and put it

176
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
make it immediately zero and put it
 

177
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,190
make it immediately zero and put it
under one

178
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
under one
 

179
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,909
under one
okay do you get it okay so this should

180
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
okay do you get it okay so this should
 

181
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,270
okay do you get it okay so this should
be very simple okay

182
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
be very simple okay
 

183
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,070
be very simple okay
how how do we do this define yeah okay

184
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
how how do we do this define yeah okay
 

185
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,110
how how do we do this define yeah okay
define let's say repair okay repair

186
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
define let's say repair okay repair
 

187
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,629
define let's say repair okay repair
repair parentheses all right

188
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639

 

189
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,670

and s let's call it answer

190
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
and s let's call it answer
 

191
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,710
and s let's call it answer
equals zero okay this is the answer

192
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
equals zero okay this is the answer
 

193
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,629
equals zero okay this is the answer
we're going to return alright

194
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
we're going to return alright
 

195
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,510
we're going to return alright
yeah and then current parents right look

196
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
yeah and then current parents right look
 

197
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,550
yeah and then current parents right look
balance

198
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
balance
 

199
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,670
balance
balance we call it zero at the beginning

200
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
balance we call it zero at the beginning
 

201
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,150
balance we call it zero at the beginning
for i in s

202
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
for i in s
 

203
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,350
for i in s
look if i equals

204
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
look if i equals
 

205
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,390
look if i equals
left parenthesis right open in

206
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
left parenthesis right open in
 

207
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,350
left parenthesis right open in
parenthesis

208
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
parenthesis
 

209
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,510
parenthesis
then what should we do now we should

210
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
then what should we do now we should
 

211
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,270
then what should we do now we should
increment the balance right

212
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
increment the balance right
 

213
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,870
increment the balance right
this is the the code to say how many

214
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
this is the the code to say how many
 

215
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,990
this is the the code to say how many
opening brackets we

216
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
opening brackets we
 

217
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,189
opening brackets we
have right s l is

218
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
have right s l is
 

219
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,310
have right s l is
i equals the closing parenthesis

220
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
i equals the closing parenthesis
 

221
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,749
i equals the closing parenthesis
then we need to decrement decrement

222
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
then we need to decrement decrement
 

223
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,029
then we need to decrement decrement
the counter to one right right but if

224
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
the counter to one right right but if
 

225
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,710
the counter to one right right but if
it's below zero what happened

226
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
it's below zero what happened
 

227
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,310
it's below zero what happened
if it would be zero it's quite similar

228
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
if it would be zero it's quite similar
 

229
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,390
if it would be zero it's quite similar
below zero then we make it zero

230
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
below zero then we make it zero
 

231
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,550
below zero then we make it zero
right make it zero but we need to

232
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
right make it zero but we need to
 

233
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,870
right make it zero but we need to
increment the answer

234
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880

not quite right you we still have to

254
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
not quite right you we still have to
 

255
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,469
not quite right you we still have to
we still have to do what

256
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479

remember when we do this
 

263
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,150
remember when we do this
one two one

one two one
 

265
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,110
one two one
so we have one left right it means we

266
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
so we have one left right it means we
 

267
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,350
so we have one left right it means we
need to close

268
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
need to close
 

269
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,870
need to close
one bracket am right

270
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
one bracket am right
 

271
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,469
one bracket am right
do you get it it's quite similar than

272
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
do you get it it's quite similar than
 

273
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,150
do you get it it's quite similar than
the one yesterday right

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
in the bracket sorry if it's
 

279
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,749
in the bracket sorry if it's
under zero if it's under zero like this

under zero if it's under zero like this
 

281
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,150
under zero if it's under zero like this
look

282
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
look
 

283
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,710
look
if if it's under zero right if it's

284
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
if if it's under zero right if it's
 

285
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,309
if if it's under zero right if it's
under zero

286

under zero
 

287
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,629
under zero
and i and answer increment one and then

288
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
and i and answer increment one and then
 

289
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,390
and i and answer increment one and then
my appearance is zero because

290
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
my appearance is zero because
 

291
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,830
my appearance is zero because
now i can stop okay do you get it yeah

292
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
now i can stop okay do you get it yeah
 

293
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,629
now i can stop okay do you get it yeah
so look how many do you need

294
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639

 

295
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,110

three yeah because look always smaller

296
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
three yeah because look always smaller
 

297
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,830
three yeah because look always smaller
than zero

298
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
than zero
 

299
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,710
than zero
minus one minus one minus one make it

300
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
minus one minus one minus one make it
 

301
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,110
minus one minus one minus one make it
zero make it zero make it zero and

302
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
zero make it zero make it zero and
 

303
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,189
zero make it zero make it zero and
increment the answer three times got it

304
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
increment the answer three times got it
 

305
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,230
increment the answer three times got it
yeah babe

306
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
yeah babe
 

307
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,230
yeah babe
yeah you need to make the balance yellow

308
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
yeah you need to make the balance yellow
 

309
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,230
yeah you need to make the balance yellow
otherwise because

310
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
otherwise because
 

311
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,790
otherwise because
yeah yeah yeah because if you're not

312
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
yeah yeah yeah because if you're not
 

313
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,469
yeah yeah yeah because if you're not
making a zero then this

314
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
making a zero then this
 

315
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,909
making a zero then this
this will be incorrect right because

316
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
this will be incorrect right because
 

317
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,430
this will be incorrect right because
you're adding the answers and parents

318
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
you're adding the answers and parents
 

319
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,990
you're adding the answers and parents
together

320
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
together
 

321
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,589
together
right yeah how's the complexity time

322
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
right yeah how's the complexity time
 

323
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,550
right yeah how's the complexity time
complexity is

324
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
complexity is
 

325
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,629
complexity is
do you still remember our

326
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639

 

327
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,990

no no no no no oh

328
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
no no no no no oh
 

329
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,629
no no no no no oh
because we're going through the string

330
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
because we're going through the string
 

331
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,350
because we're going through the string
once

332
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
once
 

333
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,390
once
it's exactly what okay so that's good so

334
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
it's exactly what okay so that's good so
 

335
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,909
it's exactly what okay so that's good so
how about

336
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
how about
 

337
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,270
how about
any questions say god

338
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
any questions say god
 

339
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,430
any questions say god
no no no
