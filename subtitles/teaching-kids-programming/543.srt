00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,580
hello Mr Mr Ryan all right

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,080
that's a few lessons we talk about the

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,080
maze program right amazed

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,240
so basically we want to find out the

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,520
nearest exit to the engine in the Maze

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,619
okay and the entrance could be anywhere

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,960
actually it doesn't actually have to be

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,779
on the border but let's to simplify the

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,320
engine is the empty cell On the Border

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,019
and the axes are empty cells on the

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,520
border right the empty sets for example

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,640
these two okay

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,800
so obviously the entrance is not the

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,020
exit if we put the people here little

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,120
people here and we can't go back to

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,760
where the the same engine right it's not

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,140
counted as an exit we talk about the

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,000
first massage

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,780
and we'll talk about the deficit search

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,360
right so these two are the popular past

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,100
finding algorithm in the in a graph we

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,039
want to find out the shortest path in

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,100
this unweighted graph the anointed

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,799
because each step right so if we are

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,740
here so we have four directions to go

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,260
and each time we move one position it

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,780
costs one step this is animated okay

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,700
yeah it has to be animated because if

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,760
it's a weighted then

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,159
Massachusetts is not working right it

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,920
has to be animated so perfect search

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,380
level by level we use the DQ level by

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,439
level these are perfect search argument

34
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,740
guarantees that as soon as we find the

35
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,080
exit is the shortest right so for

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,119
example like in this graph it could be

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,040
two axis right it could be one actually

38
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,860
here one that says here but if we

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,640
perform the processors level by level

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,960
this axis is the shortest but not the

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,820
deficit

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,360
Dash we perform the default search

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,159
because as deep as we can and then the

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,500
first action we find is this one this

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,140
one is clearly not the ultimate the

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,820
ultimate is this one right okay but we

47
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,979
can apply the deficits to find the

48
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,259
shortest class if we explore all the

49
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,180
paths right if we just pull Force the

50
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,360
graph and then we know they have to

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,120
access and obviously we know this one is

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,420
the shortest it's the ultimate buffer

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,599
search Q DQ first in first sound will

54
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,739
push the note into the queue and then we

55
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,480
take it out from the left hand side

56
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,760
let's pop left

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,459
and I will push its next step back to

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,879
the queue this is in queue when we push

59
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,620
the kids back to the queue we have to

60
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,599
make sure this note is not visited

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,660
before so we use the headset or

62
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,959
alternatively we can mark the visitors

63
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:43,379
say walls right okay so look because

64
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,680
each cell we can only visit it once

65
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,840
so as long as we put it into the queue

66
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,060
we can mark it as a wall right so it's

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,040
not pick up again and for that massage

68
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,800
the same thing okay but for def research

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,660
we have to mark and unmark and we talk

70
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,800
about this problem right look if this is

71
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:04,319
exit this here is exit

72
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,140
so the deficit it could be somewhere

73
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,260
here right here right we found the path

74
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,659
but this is not Optima this is Optimum

75
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,739
right but if we're not unmarking this

76
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,140
picture

77
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,620
so this picture is taken so obviously

78
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,760
you can go through these parts again

79
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,280
yeah and that's why I was going to leave

80
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,080
the first search we have to unmark it a

81
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
market Mark and a market and we use the

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,940
recursion right we talk about that last

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,500
lesson right okay so Ryan you said this

84
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,860
lesson we're going to talk about what

85
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,440
kind of addresses

86
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:39,900
different search okay iterated

87
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,420
dependencies it's simple but to do this

88
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,120
iterative differences we have to find

89
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,580
out how do we do this test

90
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,099
let me search

91
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,560
okay let me search what steps limited

92
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:56,159
it's actually that first search

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,819
but with the limit right with the limit

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:04,140
PFS so FD research is actually that

95
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:06,659
first search plus limit which limit okay

96
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,519
look at this uh tree we're gonna find

97
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,879
the tree or it doesn't have to be

98
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,159
managed actually it's a coach tree right

99
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,160
what's called

100
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,859
q u a d means four right what is it for

101
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,199
each cell a mouse has four kids right

102
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,720
you can move to the neighboring for kids

103
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,620
so it could be four four feet is this

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,620
means for in English

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,639
so this is not the axis we stop

106
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,860
we increment the limit to one

107
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,780
okay so when we increment the limit to

108
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,360
one so basically we're seeing this

109
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,000
simplified code tree so we perform a

110
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,820
double search we don't fight it we

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,220
increment the limit okay so we perform a

112
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,300
deficit look and I found the exit right

113
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,300
and then this is the settings

114
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,500
good question well that means that this

115
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,360
is the exit secret what are sequence to

116
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,360
finding this exit the iterative

117
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,759
difference

118
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,919
has been on some black men and red and

119
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,919
red mixed with the black okay

120
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,800
let's do the prefer search professors

121
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,699
order

122
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,699
easy one

123
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,560
okay we found it this is the shortest

124
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,560
okay what's the type of search on it

125
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,560
right

126
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,180
okay we find this this is not the

127
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,220
optimum right so we need to continue

128
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,960
three seven tenants

129
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,639
okay and then we'll find this and this

130
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,280
is uh okay what's the iterating

131
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,580
difference we set the tabs to zero

132
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,259
what's the order now one right yeah this

133
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,120
is the limit basically I want to say

134
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,639
that to Yellow it means that we only see

135
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,900
these three we only see these three okay

136
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,900
this is one okay

137
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:30,259
[Laughter]

138
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,259
so what do we see yeah

139
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,500
we increment

140
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:39,780
okay what's the temperature one two four

141
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,300
two four five six three seven eight

142
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,419
sorry okay we found it yeah at the

143
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,419
beginning

144
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,919
so the maximum D given is maze this is

145
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,139
the columns C and this is r

146
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:57,960
can you imagine what's the longest

147
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:02,210
what's in Siri what's the longest uh

148
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:05,260
path for entering to the exit

149
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,260
[Music]

150
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,400
what's the longest you can imagine

151
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,160
the longest I'm not talking about

152
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,280
shortage longest so in what cases you

153
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,039
can get a long distance

154
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,280
you never go to the exit or place an

155
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:26,160
axis what's the axis

156
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,740
look yeah no you can't Loop that's

157
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,539
actually a very good point okay if we

158
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,120
can move but there is no longest right

159
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:36,900
you can just go round and round okay how

160
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,300
about you can Loop a myth a very long

161
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,639
way from top left to bottom left that's

162
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,080
right yeah the entrance is here right

163
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,520
the exit will be here you could be back

164
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,680
there right

165
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,599
um

166
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,060
okay this is long exactly so that's our

167
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:55,680
time to see right I can't see you Siri

168
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,840
right in series okay so why are T is

169
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,699
smaller than because we start with zero

170
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,160
it's smaller than three right like if we

171
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:06,300
perform this step we may search with the

172
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,120
currency and an entry yeah the entrance

173
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,940
and then obviously we need to have a

174
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,160
headset or marking the position visit

175
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,199
the position walls and I Market okay

176
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,440
let's use the headset first scene table

177
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:23,340
so we put a set headset a notebook right

178
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,620
if we find it let me turn T right

179
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,020
okay so one question can you tell me why

180
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,660
if we find that node and it guarantees

181
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,180
the circus so how to use true it's a

182
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,760
shortage if we I just visually look at

183
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,740
it yeah I know I mean the definitely

184
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,740
message while we do this iterative

185
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,599
differences you know because it's

186
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,880
because

187
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,300
you can go like level by level you're

188
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,300
basically yeah it basically like

189
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,300
foreign

190
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,680
that's the difference right we find

191
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,620
definitely research D the entering right

192
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,180
the current position okay position

193
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:27,420
and scene table if if the partition is

194
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:30,959
exit is Exit okay I'm writing this and

195
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:33,060
also position is not entering

196
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,660
then we find it right we finally exit

197
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,940
then we turn two okay and then if this

198
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,580
position already seen before return

199
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,100
false we don't go back otherwise the

200
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,140
first thing is to put it in a notebook

201
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,760
right and then we have to check look if

202
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,760
T is smaller than zero

203
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,720
and otherwise you know what to do right

204
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,580
for a drbc in four direction right in

205
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,940
four Direction indones in four Direction

206
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,019
one zero zero one one uh one zero zero

207
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,540
one

208
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:12,660
this is the direction of set okay fourth

209
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:16,860
Direction zero minus one minus one zero

210
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:19,920
and then n r and C equals the d r plus r

211
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,380
d c plus c okay RC is actually from

212
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,220
partition R C equals position okay

213
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:28,500
and then if we need to check n r is uh

214
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,019
is within the range

215
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,760
and

216
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:38,880
NC is also with the range and also

217
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,800
if the Maze and I and C it's not a word

218
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,959
right it's not what we don't go to the

219
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,760
wall right if it's a wall we don't go in

220
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,180
there there's no point we can't pass

221
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,500
through the wall if that's B Mister

222
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,959
that's the question this is basically a

223
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,120
recession which is the T minus one right

224
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,700
with the T minus one that's the search

225
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,160
this T is incrementing and I definitely

226
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,779
message we can do it uh opposite which

227
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,160
is incrementing we decrement the

228
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,740
positivity

229
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,320
because here is passing the positive D

230
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,899
we decrement The anti-e Falls below zero

231
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,560
or below or equals zero okay and then we

232
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:16,440
turn through y the position nine T the

233
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,140
scene table and then return four okay so

234
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,320
look here we add it so we have to unmark

235
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,000
it remove right remove our RC okay look

236
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,040
at this is pretty much like the deficit

237
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,040
the only difference

238
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,120
the only difference is one look uh this

239
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,920
this one

240
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,019
what's this

241
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,820
if T is smaller or equal than zero

242
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,399
written first what's what's this mean

243
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,180
why are we adding this Criterion one

244
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,180
question because it's

245
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,640
like yeah basically we perform a

246
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,399
definitely massage yeah if we set the

247
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,100
limit to here then we don't go to the

248
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,040
deeper one we leave it to the Future

249
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,620
right this is what it means yeah all the

250
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,720
rest similar to deficit okay so this

251
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,420
actually guarantees the shot is passed

252
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,640
right and then it's more efficient than

253
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,640
deficit obviously but it's not as

254
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,800
efficient as professors right but why do

255
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,920
we need this uh iterated differences

256
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,720
that first search right this is not a

257
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,200
good player here right this is not

258
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,200
Optimum

259
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,560
why do we need to use the iterative

260
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,480
differences and why do we need to use

261
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,279
preferences in some cases

262
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,519
Okay so

263
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:37,860
these two first okay but first search

264
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,860
because we have a queue right we have a

265
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,279
Q we have a Q

266
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,560
so this has this larger space use right

267
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:50,040
the iterative differences is basically

268
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,500
you know recursion so it has a oh look

269
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,740
when you set the harmony to T right it

270
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,860
has an OD space using right because look

271
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:02,480
the only store current pass which is

272
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,480
three now right yeah

273
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,860
if this is this you only install the

274
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:14,220
path the space uses you only store this

275
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:17,220
past right but from The Breakfast search

276
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,959
for search you need to store all the

277
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,779
nodes in the current level which could

278
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,000
be very big so the space uses in terms

279
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:27,000
of space uses this is efficient and

280
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,700
processor iterative research is also has

281
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,139
the same space uses in the deficitors

282
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,240
yeah that's such

283
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:36,560
okay so okay so what have you learned

284
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,480
today about may I do need to resin

285
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,180
iterated deepening step

286
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,680
okay so I mean more details please

287
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:49,220
whatever you go first okay so I'll do my

288
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:53,220
integrated 15 minutes

289
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:56,220
yeah and it's basically for the search

290
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:59,700
and you have a limit for your depth and

291
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,040
then you search for the exit and then if

292
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,240
there's another x that you increase your

293
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,320
limit

294
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:10,860
one step further and then and on and

295
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:14,700
then so on until you get you get finally

296
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,600
exit and which is the cutest exit and

297
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,220
also

298
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,180
I learned

299
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,720
um

300
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:27,060
it's written they didn't remember even

301
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:30,720
more like it's not it's more like use it

302
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:35,720
it has less use of space than both

303
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:39,660
search as as if Jesse perfect

304
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:43,019
really touch just chalk super nurse in

305
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,940
the queue and well iterating different

306
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,100
definitely search

307
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,880
just only

308
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:53,160
uses like the only like one light bar

309
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,920
yeah yeah we're done good job good job

310
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,019
okay

311
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,779
finding the nearest exit to the engine

312
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:02,180
in the Maze we have so far cover three

313
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:05,279
aggro that's

314
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,500
iterated differences okay so these three

315
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,420
are the parts find in a in a graph right

316
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,880
basically we can visualize it in the

317
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,060
graph find the tree you know try three

318
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,519
quarter tree a graph and directed graph

319
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,160
waiting I'm waiting graph it has to be

320
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,680
unweighted okay because if it's weighted

321
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,959
then we can apply the professor we have

322
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,440
to use the decade straw remember we

323
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:31,019
talked about the shortest part decostra

324
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,420
yeah yeah for your washer yeah the

325
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:36,860
Castro

326
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,860
b-i-k J D Construction

327
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,500
okay

328
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,880
a uniform causes yeah we cover that in

329
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:50,459
about 100 day 200 days of the Unison

330
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,459
yeah okay that's it for today bye

331
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,459
bye
