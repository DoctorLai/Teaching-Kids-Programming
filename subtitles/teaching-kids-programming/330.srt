1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,400
hello mystery are you right

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,240
okay

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,320
okay good thank you for doing that okay

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,719
so today we're going to talk about a

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,200
little mess problem

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:18,160
and square plus 19 times n minus and

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,760
what's this factorial factorial okay

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,320
what's factorial

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,400
factorial is

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,680
what's factoring

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,960
n

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,519
times

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,079
n minus one

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,200
n minus two

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,200
until one

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,559
okay and what's zero factorial you

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,239
missed n minus

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,879
yeah

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,039
okay oh yeah yeah all right yes

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,559
okay okay what's the and what's yellow

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,000
factor

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,640
one okay what's one factor

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,480
uh one okay we're done okay good and how

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,079
do we implement this unfortunate thing

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,160
remember we talked about this in the

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,280
first lesson right

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,760
yeah what's the first thing in essence

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,000
the first implication

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,119
okay so let's look if n is zero

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,479
return we we define the base case which

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,799
is

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,640
yeah which is one otherwise it would be

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,960
returned

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,119
n times what can you write a location

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,119
here

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,119
f1

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,960
minus one we have done wow you remember

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,560
i know you can also turn this into

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,560
factor uh because

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,840
uh yeah you're bigger

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,759
iterative so which is what answer equals

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,079
one and then we

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,280
we went for i in letter for n in range

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,200
let's say for i in range and

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,479
range m plus y because we're going to

46
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,159
multiply two

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,159
actually we can start from the two right

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,000
because multiply one

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,320
changes nothing right

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,159
okay answer

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,439
times equal

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,119
i

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,720
and then return what

54
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,039
three one

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,039
come on

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,040
there's no n answer equals one return

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,599
one come on

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,599
yeah this answer keeps the result of the

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,239
factory right and then start from two to

60
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,080
n

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,440
every time i times this i right do you

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,840
get it

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,720
what what did i just say your pc drawing

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,440
leave

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,239
he said it times and

66
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,080
now i yeah i is the yeah the thing with

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,080
intertime okay i'm so smart

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,280
okay

69
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,680
[Music]

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,680
so look

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,840
we want to solve this equation so what's

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,920
n n

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,480
is n what's the range of n

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:59,200
what's n if look we're looking at this

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,599
yeah i know so in order for n factorial

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,560
to make sense and it should be bigger

77
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,599
and equal zero non-negative right and n

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,200
should be

79
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,200
should be y should be the type of

80
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,400
integer right it can't be a real number

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,000
right it can't be three point five

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,319
because three point five factorial makes

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,519
no sense it can't be negative number

84
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,599
minus one factorial makes no sense okay

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,760
yeah is it possible

86
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,959
no no no no we don't define that yeah

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,000
okay so look

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,000
can n be zero

89
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,040
zero zero minus zero factorial minus one

90
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,040
is not equal to zero okay okay so

91
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,360
no it's too big i don't know 1960 is a

92
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,360
big number okay so

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,760
so i mean what if we want to ask

94
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,840
computer to solve it what kind of

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,080
equilibrium are you thinking do you

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,080
think

97
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,920
what kind of ergon

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,239
can we use to

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,040
try different values

100
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,120
try every possibilities

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,439
what's that called simcoe how do we ask

102
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,640
computers to solve this problem to try

103
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,760
every value

104
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,879
try the possible values

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,879
what's the angle and cost

106
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,439
beautiful thing

107
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,400
but look we know that the minimum that

108
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,160
possible value is zero right

109
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,240
but we don't know the upper bound right

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,199
the lower bound is zero the upper bound

111
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,720
could be

112
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,960
we don't know yet we don't know which

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,880
number right so we can in this case we

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,199
can ask computers to keep trying and

115
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,040
they found it it may not find its answer

116
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
okay we know we don't know i don't think

117
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,960
there's a possible one yeah that's the

118
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,560
problem okay if there's no such answer

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,800
then computer will keep trying or we

120
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,040
never end right because they just keep

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,560
trying and how do we do this

122
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,600
okay

123
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,360
why are true right why assume is okay

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,919
this is always true

125
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,479
enter this loop if this is always true

126
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,840
then we keep trying this right and at

127
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,240
the beginning the first number we're

128
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,800
going to try is zero and if n times n

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,120
okay n times n squared n squared we can

130
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:10,720
implement n times n

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:13,120
and all what n times times remember one

132
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,919
two okay we're done all we use the math

133
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,160
function where is the power

134
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,160
and

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,800
what what's the second perimeter um

136
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,759
yeah there's three ways these three a's

137
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,680
are equivalent okay if n times n plus

138
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,759
19 times and

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,280
minus n factorial right we can we

140
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,440
already define it

141
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,000
or look we don't need to reinvent the

142
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,000
wheel in order to be inventory we are

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,440
we don't need to implement this we can

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,440
just import

145
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,880
from

146
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,039
mass

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,880
import

148
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,720
factorial yeah because we already

149
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,160
defined this factorial factorial

150
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,919
factory and we just can say factorial

151
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,720
factorial n right if equal equal zero

152
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,720
then grade we just return

153
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,840
n okay otherwise m plus equal one right

154
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
right

155
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,400
look

156
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,319
we don't define the outer part so what

157
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,479
does it mean if laser there is no such

158
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,720
solutions and the computer will just

159
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,840
keep trying keep trying keep trying keep

160
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,360
trying keep trying and you never end

161
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,280
right that's that's the

162
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,280
one this uh pitfall that they're using

163
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,280
these profiles to try because we just

164
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,880
ask computers just to

165
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,960
you know

166
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,960
naively trying right without thinking

167
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,840
uh okay so

168
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,039
we want to find out these yeah but the

169
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,039
thing is that

170
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,560
this function this is a quadratic

171
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,199
function and this is the factorial

172
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,800
function we don't know how you know

173
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,800
that the growth they grow like the

174
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
trends

175
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,480
[Music]

176
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,280
is

177
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,400
but

178
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,400
let's understand this a little bit more

179
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,120
okay this is look

180
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,199
this this is a quadratic function and

181
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,680
it's not easy to analyze it because the

182
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,240
projective function remember if it is n

183
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,280
squared plus 19 and if n is zero is zero

184
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,639
right if n is one it's 20 right so it

185
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,960
could be something like that right the

186
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,639
continuity function right remember

187
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,039
yeah yeah

188
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,599
unless it's n factorial we don't know

189
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,440
yet yeah so it's really hard to compare

190
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,720
these two right without plugging in some

191
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,160
value but we can make it a simple right

192
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,319
look

193
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
let's move this thing to the right right

194
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,280
side okay

195
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,000
okay so n squared plus 19 and equals

196
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,919
answer right yeah

197
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,599
yeah just move relation to the right and

198
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,280
change the sign

199
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,280
okay so now 25

200
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,680
so n bacteria equals what n times

201
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,120
n minus one factorial right

202
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,160
makes sense

203
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,240
yes and we know n is not zero right

204
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,039
yeah we just prove the n is not zero

205
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
right

206
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,879
if n is not zero we can divide

207
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,560
both sides

208
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,400
some right yeah

209
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,479
so we can get rid of these

210
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,560
uh let's try this

211
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,039
look look n square plus is is n plus 19

212
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,000
right this is the same thing n times n

213
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,120
n times

214
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,320
19 right and now we can divide it by n

215
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
uh

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,080
in both sides so we get rid of this

217
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,040
because out right n plus 19.

218
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,399
yeah

219
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,519
okay

220
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,000
okay so

221
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,279
let's let's rewrite let's use a k k

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,320
equals n minus one okay let's let's just

223
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,720
just substitute the variable

224
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,760
n minus one is k

225
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,040
so what's this so n equals k plus one

226
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,959
right

227
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,240
right

228
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,320
k plus 1 plus 19 with the left side and

229
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,320
the right side becomes what

230
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,480
k factorial right

231
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,920
right makes sense

232
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,959
what did i just do

233
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,320
e is k factorial what's k

234
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,560
k is

235
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,399
k plus 1 plus 19.

236
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,000
it's k yeah i i just substitute the

237
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,600
variable okay another k plus 20 equals k

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,839
factorial right

239
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,320
it

240
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,080
says okay so look this is a lot simpler

241
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,920
than the original one this is conjecture

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,320
this is the line linear k plus 20 equals

243
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,839
k what's k plus here k plus 30 is a line

244
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,440
right so how do we plot this line k

245
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,279
factorial all right

246
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,200
when k is zero

247
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,000
is it uh it's 20 here right

248
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,920
okay so one k is one is 21 so it would

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,320
be something like i thought the answer

250
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,519
is

251
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,000
m minus one equals k okay

252
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,399
like this is this question yeah yeah i i

253
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,519
just substitute the n minus one with k

254
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,279
okay

255
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,200
yeah yeah

256
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,760
because i don't like this and minus one

257
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,120
thing so i substitute with k

258
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,800
and then up

259
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,560
so n is k plus one so look

260
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,720
if i can solve the k

261
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,040
if i can solve the k so i know the n

262
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,399
right it's the same thing all right

263
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,360
yeah

264
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,360
so k plus 2 this is a line right you'll

265
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,839
be something like that right

266
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,800
and k factorial

267
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,760
calculator is each the trend should be

268
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,640
growing much much lower 0 factorial is

269
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,320
one it's somewhere here one factorial is

270
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,800
also one

271
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,120
right that's tiny yeah because this is

272
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,320
twenty and then two factorial is two

273
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,519
right

274
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,399
three factorial is

275
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,079
six

276
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,079
six

277
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,440
four factorial two

278
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,920
thirty four

279
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,839
this is th this is one this is twenty

280
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,200
yeah yeah so you'll be here right and

281
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,880
five factorial

282
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,440
120

283
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,560
they which one grows faster which one

284
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,399
you think is grow faster

285
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,519
this one yeah this one so what does it

286
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,959
mean after five right because when k is

287
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,800
five

288
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,160
this line is 25 and then that's 4 plus

289
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,040
20.

290
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,279
1k is 5. the left side is

291
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,279
uh

292
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,279
25

293
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,720
but i thought

294
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,959
oh yeah yeah okay

295
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,680
yeah yeah yeah yeah so when k is four

296
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,399
should be four yeah when k is four

297
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,600
when k is four okay so this is when k is

298
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,720
four

299
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,959
uh this is five one k is four k is uh

300
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,600
this line is twenty four and four factor

301
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:02,560
is also 24 right so what happened is 5

302
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,000
5 this is 25 here right

303
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,279
but this thing 10 0 is here

304
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,040
so

305
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,560
the more after 5 right faster four

306
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,560
anything on the right

307
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,040
this case the case material thing going

308
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,959
faster growing faster right

309
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,120
growing a lot faster and then these two

310
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,880
lines what does it mean

311
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,760
you never cross again

312
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,839
right am right

313
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,360
the only thing it costs is here k equals

314
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,440
12 right

315
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,160
makes sense

316
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,480
okay so if k then we can solve this then

317
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,240
we can just solve this we know

318
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,160
that there's only one solution right

319
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,639
that we just proved like we know it's

320
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,040
only the one solution is k equals four

321
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,680
which is n equals five

322
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,839
there's no such solution right

323
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,800
there's no other solution right because

324
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,399
we already know the land this is how we

325
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,800
prove that we only have this one

326
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,639
solution make sense

327
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,360
yeah so coming back to the original we

328
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,600
blue force we don't know yeah because

329
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,920
even you find a solution for k uh n

330
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,839
equals five how do you know how do you

331
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,680
know there's no such other solution

332
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,040
right you the computer

333
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,040
can't prove

334
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,560
but we human we just prove because we

335
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,519
plot the graph

336
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,760
this is only the correspond

337
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,000
and when it goes further when the k when

338
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,519
the k becomes bigger

339
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,839
the difference

340
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,320
becomes larger

341
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,519
make sense

342
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,639
make sense

343
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,440
yes

344
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,880
okay so we just proved that k equals 4

345
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,680
and n equals 5 this is the only solution

346
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,000
right because we can proof of this bit

347
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,519
the domain is here and we don't know

348
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,399
because there are lots of numbers here

349
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,199
but we know they are not solutions

350
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,959
okay any questions

351
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,120
okay what did you learn today come on

352
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,199
learn about that math

353
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,680
math okay and how did you come up with

354
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,279
five as in first okay

355
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,210
how many numbers have you proved for us

356
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,040
before you get to five

357
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,399
[Music]

358
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,639
six

359
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,560
six and you find it too big

360
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,480
yeah

361
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,519
six numbers

362
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,160
yeah

363
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,839
i guess so yeah okay so we tried zero

364
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,880
you try one you try two you try three

365
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,079
you try for five open you got it right

366
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,519
yeah okay by you but you

367
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,079
but you have an answer then there's

368
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,480
other solutions yeah

369
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,040
okay so this is to tell you that five is

370
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,120
the only right answer okay yeah okay

371
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,800
good job today that's it for today

372
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,040
bye bye

373
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,040
bye bye
