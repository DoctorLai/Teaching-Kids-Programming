hello hello hello mr mr ryan how are you

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:04,480
hello hello hello mr mr ryan how are you
 

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,749
hello hello hello mr mr ryan how are you
today

4
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:05,759
today
 

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,230
today
okay look this here is a triangle number

6
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
okay look this here is a triangle number
 

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,750
okay look this here is a triangle number
triangle okay so today

8
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,760
triangle okay so today
 

9
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,390
triangle okay so today
our job is to come up with an approach

10
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
our job is to come up with an approach
 

11
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,589
our job is to come up with an approach
to find the

12
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
to find the
 

13
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,670
to find the
minimum path from the top to the bottom

14
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
minimum path from the top to the bottom
 

15
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,670
minimum path from the top to the bottom
so can you find every time you can go to

16
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
so can you find every time you can go to
 

17
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,429
so can you find every time you can go to
the left or right yeah

18
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
the left or right yeah
 

19
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,630
the left or right yeah
and then the number of score is the

20
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
and then the number of score is the
 

21
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,670
and then the number of score is the
number of lump

22
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
number of lump
 

23
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,790
number of lump
uh is the numbers you pick right for

24
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
uh is the numbers you pick right for
 

25
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,230
uh is the numbers you pick right for
example you can take this two

26
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
example you can take this two
 

27
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,069
example you can take this two
three six one so your score will be

28
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
three six one so your score will be
 

29
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,350
three six one so your score will be
five plus six twelve okay twelve

30
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
five plus six twelve okay twelve
 

31
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,950
five plus six twelve okay twelve
can you find another class with the

32
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
can you find another class with the
 

33
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,549
can you find another class with the
minimum no no wait

34
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
minimum no no wait
 

35
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,350
minimum no no wait
what with minimum yeah minimum i wanted

36
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
what with minimum yeah minimum i wanted
 

37
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,069
what with minimum yeah minimum i wanted
a minimum

38
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
a minimum
 

39
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,990
a minimum
minimum plus some pass some

40
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
minimum plus some pass some
 

41
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,029
minimum plus some pass some
person so you can go to the left three

42
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
person so you can go to the left three
 

43
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,189
person so you can go to the left three
five two three five one so what's this

44
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199

 

45
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,590

i think eleven yeah yeah that's the

46
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
i think eleven yeah yeah that's the
 

47
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,349
i think eleven yeah yeah that's the
minimum yeah you cannot find any

48
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
minimum yeah you cannot find any
 

49
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,310
minimum yeah you cannot find any
any other parts which is smaller than

50
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
any other parts which is smaller than
 

51
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,429
any other parts which is smaller than
this one right

52
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
this one right
 

53
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,630
this one right
yeah so look two four five three and two

54
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
yeah so look two four five three and two
 

55
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,550
yeah so look two four five three and two
four seven eight is more than the

56
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
four seven eight is more than the
 

57
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,390
four seven eight is more than the
eleventh so that one is the optimal

58
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
eleventh so that one is the optimal
 

59
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,910
eleventh so that one is the optimal
answer we're looking for

60
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
answer we're looking for
 

61
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,469
answer we're looking for
so any idea how we're solving that i

62
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
so any idea how we're solving that i
 

63
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,109
so any idea how we're solving that i
mean this is

64
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
mean this is
 

65
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,950
mean this is
uh oh oh you just add all the smallest

66
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
uh oh oh you just add all the smallest
 

67
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,109
uh oh oh you just add all the smallest
numbers in there yeah

68
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
numbers in there yeah
 

69
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,270
numbers in there yeah
and then each line in good choice

70
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
and then each line in good choice
 

71
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,550
and then each line in good choice
smaller but but it may not be

72
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
smaller but but it may not be
 

73
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,910
smaller but but it may not be
look um you

74
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
look um you
 

75
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,789
look um you
you saying you pick the smallest yeah

76
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
you saying you pick the smallest yeah
 

77
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,870
you saying you pick the smallest yeah
yeah that may work but in some cases

78
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
yeah that may work but in some cases
 

79
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,190
yeah that may work but in some cases
you may not you may know what i need

80
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
you may not you may know what i need
 

81
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,990
you may not you may know what i need
okay

82
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
okay
 

83
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,510
okay
okay good question i need to come up

84
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
okay good question i need to come up
 

85
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,590
okay good question i need to come up
with a case that picking the minimum is

86
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
with a case that picking the minimum is
 

87
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,550
with a case that picking the minimum is
not

88
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
not
 

89
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,670
not
uh it's not it's not for example like

90
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
uh it's not it's not for example like
 

91
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,789
uh it's not it's not for example like
uh if i put a if i swap

92
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
uh if i put a if i swap
 

93
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,830
uh if i put a if i swap
with i put a

94
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
with i put a
 

95
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,950
with i put a
two here right yes yeah

96
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
two here right yes yeah
 

97
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,230
two here right yes yeah
two here right yes and then i

98
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
two here right yes and then i
 

99
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,149
two here right yes and then i
put uh a minus ten here

100
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
put uh a minus ten here
 

101
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,710
put uh a minus ten here
yeah okay you can contain the minus look

102
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
yeah okay you can contain the minus look
 

103
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,190
yeah okay you can contain the minus look
you pick

104
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
you pick
 

105
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,550
you pick
the num the smallest two three

106
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
the num the smallest two three
 

107
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,270
the num the smallest two three
five but five cannot go to here right

108
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
five but five cannot go to here right
 

109
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,390
five but five cannot go to here right
you cannot

110
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
you cannot
 

111
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,790
you cannot
pick minus ten all right yeah because

112
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
pick minus ten all right yeah because
 

113
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,410
pick minus ten all right yeah because
it's not on the left

114
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:22,420
it's not on the left
 

115
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:35,430

whatever ryan said i'm not gonna repeat

118
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:37,840
whatever ryan said i'm not gonna repeat
 

119
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,630
whatever ryan said i'm not gonna repeat
that again

120
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
that again
 

121
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,910
that again
so you know first where is the minus

122
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
so you know first where is the minus
 

123
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,630
so you know first where is the minus
number

124
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
number
 

125
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,550
number
okay so then uh you try to make ten

126
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
okay so then uh you try to make ten
 

127
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,790
okay so then uh you try to make ten
try to make two the thing is that you

128
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
try to make two the thing is that you
 

129
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,470
try to make two the thing is that you
cannot pick the smallest

130
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
cannot pick the smallest
 

131
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,869
cannot pick the smallest
in the fourth row right because when you

132
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
in the fourth row right because when you
 

133
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,070
in the fourth row right because when you
pick one

134
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
pick one
 

135
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,630
pick one
smallest like two three five two three

136
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
smallest like two three five two three
 

137
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,470
smallest like two three five two three
five but five cannot go to

138
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
five but five cannot go to
 

139
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,390
five but five cannot go to
minus ten because you can only go to the

140
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
minus ten because you can only go to the
 

141
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,830
minus ten because you can only go to the
left and right do you get it

142
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
left and right do you get it
 

143
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,830
left and right do you get it
oh yeah yeah so you'll approach may not

144
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
oh yeah yeah so you'll approach may not

so how many paths all together look for

170
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
so how many paths all together look for
 

171
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,990
so how many paths all together look for
each one you have two possibilities

172
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
each one you have two possibilities
 

173
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,190
each one you have two possibilities
yeah if there are n rows and type of

174
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
yeah if there are n rows and type of
 

175
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,990
yeah if there are n rows and type of
rows

176
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
rows
 

177
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,910
rows
and each one you have two possibilities

178
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
and each one you have two possibilities
 

179
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,149
and each one you have two possibilities
how many

180
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
how many
 

181
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,630
how many
how many possibilities how many how many

182
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
how many possibilities how many how many
 

183
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,470
how many possibilities how many how many
ways can you pick

184
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
ways can you pick
 

185
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,750
ways can you pick
how many ways here

186
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760

 

187
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,030

why is it two two no what i mean

188
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
why is it two two no what i mean
 

189
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,030
why is it two two no what i mean
is from top to the bottom how many how

190
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
is from top to the bottom how many how
 

191
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,630
is from top to the bottom how many how
many possibilities

192
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
many possibilities
 

193
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:23,830
many possibilities
no four

194
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840

 

195
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,670

i have two possibilities here and then

196
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
i have two possibilities here and then
 

197
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,430
i have two possibilities here and then
here i have two possibilities i have two

198
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
here i have two possibilities i have two
 

199
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,629
here i have two possibilities i have two
possibilities six

200
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
possibilities six
 

201
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:35,350
possibilities six
i have two points

202
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360

 

203
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,030

sixteen come on how high

204
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
sixteen come on how high
 

205
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,830
sixteen come on how high
will it be each one i just say each one

206
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
will it be each one i just say each one
 

207
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,390
will it be each one i just say each one
has two

208
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
has two
 

209
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,629
has two
and then you have n rows so how how long

210
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
and then you have n rows so how how long
 

211
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,830
and then you have n rows so how how long
one square maybe what what

212
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
one square maybe what what
 

213
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,270
one square maybe what what
it was a jesus one look look

214
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
it was a jesus one look look
 

215
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,110
it was a jesus one look look
one i love cheese

216
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120

 

217
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,469

right three four

218
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
right three four
 

219
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,550
right three four
five six six

220
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
five six six
 

221
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,790
five six six
seven actually seven sorry you are right

222
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
seven actually seven sorry you are right
 

223
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,070
seven actually seven sorry you are right
because two to the one

224
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
because two to the one
 

225
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,870
because two to the one
one look two to lower power of one two

226
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
one look two to lower power of one two
 

227
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,990
one look two to lower power of one two
to the power two

228
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
to the power two
 

229
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,590
to the power two
two to the power of three so two to the

230
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
two to the power of three so two to the
 

231
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,029
two to the power of three so two to the
power three okay

232
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
power three okay
 

233
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,150
power three okay
yeah right yeah it does okay

234
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
yeah right yeah it does okay
 

235
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,029
yeah right yeah it does okay
so imagine if like a hundred this

236
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
so imagine if like a hundred this
 

237
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,070
so imagine if like a hundred this
approach would

238
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
approach would
 

239
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,390
approach would
two to the power of n right yeah oh

240
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
two to the power of n right yeah oh
 

241
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,469
two to the power of n right yeah oh
right and for each one you need to find

242
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
right and for each one you need to find
 

243
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,189
right and for each one you need to find
the minimum

244
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
the minimum
 

245
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,590
the minimum
right so that's the time complexity for

246
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
right so that's the time complexity for
 

247
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,710
right so that's the time complexity for
the proof of

248
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
the proof of
 

249
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,629
the proof of
yeah so we can use the dynamic

250
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
yeah so we can use the dynamic
 

251
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:49,830
yeah so we can use the dynamic
programming how how can we do it look

252
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840

 

253
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,790

so for example if we are here yeah if we

254
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
so for example if we are here yeah if we
 

255
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,590
so for example if we are here yeah if we
are here

256
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
are here
 

257
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,270
are here
then you can choose two or three you can

258
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
then you can choose two or three you can
 

259
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,189
then you can choose two or three you can
only come from these two sides yeah

260
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
only come from these two sides yeah
 

261
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,350
only come from these two sides yeah
yeah so we pick the minimum right

262
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
yeah so we pick the minimum right
 

263
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,189
yeah so we pick the minimum right
because look

264
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
because look
 

265
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,110
because look
look we can turn this

266
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
look we can turn this
 

267
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,110
look we can turn this
let's turn this triangle a little bit

268
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
let's turn this triangle a little bit
 

269
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,510
let's turn this triangle a little bit
tweeted okay tilt it so that will be

270
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
tweeted okay tilt it so that will be
 

271
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,270
tweeted okay tilt it so that will be
two three four so you become a list of

272
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
two three four so you become a list of
 

273
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,749
two three four so you become a list of
at least

274
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
at least
 

275
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,110
at least
yeah two three four six five

276
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
yeah two three four six five
 

277
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,350
yeah two three four six five
seven it looks like triangle pascal

278
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
seven it looks like triangle pascal
 

279
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,790
seven it looks like triangle pascal
triangle yeah but

280
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
triangle yeah but
 

281
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,070
triangle yeah but
not exactly okay so look so if we

282
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
not exactly okay so look so if we
 

283
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,950
not exactly okay so look so if we
if we you we uh we want to go through

284
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
if we you we uh we want to go through
 

285
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,909
if we you we uh we want to go through
this yeah

286
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
this yeah
 

287
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,990
this yeah
let's release this position and then you

288
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
let's release this position and then you
 

289
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,510
let's release this position and then you
can come from here

290
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
can come from here
 

291
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,430
can come from here
or here right right am right yeah

292
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
or here right right am right yeah
 

293
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,430
or here right right am right yeah
so if i'm i want to come here

294
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
so if i'm i want to come here
 

295
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,950
so if i'm i want to come here
and then i have two choices you could

296
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
and then i have two choices you could
 

297
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,830
and then i have two choices you could
come here and then here right

298
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840

 

299
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,230

alright

300
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
alright
 

301
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,950
alright
it's mine uh okay let's just matter it

302
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
it's mine uh okay let's just matter it
 

303
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,150
it's mine uh okay let's just matter it
doesn't matter okay so

304
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
doesn't matter okay so
 

305
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,110
doesn't matter okay so
look i can come from two positions on

306
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
look i can come from two positions on
 

307
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,790
look i can come from two positions on
the left next row right

308
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
the left next row right
 

309
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,749
the left next row right
all right yes so i always pick the

310
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
all right yes so i always pick the
 

311
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,390
all right yes so i always pick the
minimum

312
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
minimum
 

313
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,550
minimum
so for this one i always pick a minimum

314
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
so for this one i always pick a minimum
 

315
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,589
so for this one i always pick a minimum
of these two

316
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
of these two
 

317
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,629
of these two
and a plus itself right so does it make

318
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
and a plus itself right so does it make
 

319
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,150
and a plus itself right so does it make
sense

320
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
sense
 

321
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,510
sense
so so look

322
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
so so look
 

323
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,350
so so look
if if a

324
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
if if a
 

325
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,390
if if a
to b right

326
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
to b right
 

327
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,830
to b right
if a to b is

328
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
if a to b is
 

329
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,390
if a to b is
10 right right and then you will a to c

330
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
10 right right and then you will a to c
 

331
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,029
10 right right and then you will a to c
and to b this is 2 this is 3

332
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
and to b this is 2 this is 3
 

333
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,150
and to b this is 2 this is 3
all right yes so look

334
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
all right yes so look
 

335
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,350
all right yes so look
and another if the path can consist this

336
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
and another if the path can consist this
 

337
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,629
and another if the path can consist this
bit

338
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
bit
 

339
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,350
bit
and then i want to go to here so the

340
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
and then i want to go to here so the
 

341
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,469
and then i want to go to here so the
shortest path can always be replaced by

342
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
shortest path can always be replaced by
 

343
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,270
shortest path can always be replaced by
a c b right because a c b is shorter

344
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
a c b right because a c b is shorter
 

345
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,070
a c b right because a c b is shorter
than a b

346
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
than a b
 

347
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,550
than a b
right all right so does that make sense

348
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
right all right so does that make sense
 

349
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,309
right all right so does that make sense
look if a shot is passed come from

350
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
look if a shot is passed come from
 

351
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,029
look if a shot is passed come from
come from what i come from five right

352
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
come from what i come from five right
 

353
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,629
come from what i come from five right
come from five here the shortest path

354
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
come from five here the shortest path
 

355
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,309
come from five here the shortest path
comes from five

356
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
comes from five
 

357
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,110
comes from five
then i can always pick the smallest from

358
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
then i can always pick the smallest from
 

359
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,990
then i can always pick the smallest from
from these two

360
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
from these two
 

361
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,189
from these two
right which is two all right yeah

362
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
right which is two all right yeah
 

363
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,589
right which is two all right yeah
yeah does this doesn't make sense so so

364
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
yeah does this doesn't make sense so so
 

365
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,350
yeah does this doesn't make sense so so
it means the one i determine

366
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
it means the one i determine
 

367
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,589
it means the one i determine
when i determine let's say let's have a

368
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
when i determine let's say let's have a
 

369
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,430
when i determine let's say let's have a
function okay a function

370
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
function okay a function
 

371
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,790
function okay a function
row and column right if

372
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
row and column right if
 

373
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,790
row and column right if
i calculate f column r and c

374
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
i calculate f column r and c
 

375
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,150
i calculate f column r and c
it does not affect this value will not

376
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
it does not affect this value will not
 

377
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,350
it does not affect this value will not
be changed right

378
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
be changed right
 

379
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,509
be changed right
alright look because i already

380
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
alright look because i already
 

381
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,469
alright look because i already
calculated it's only based on fr plus 1

382
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
calculated it's only based on fr plus 1
 

383
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,430
calculated it's only based on fr plus 1
which is here and fr plus 1 c plus one

384
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
which is here and fr plus 1 c plus one
 

385
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,630
which is here and fr plus 1 c plus one
which is

386
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
which is
 

387
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,790
which is
the three and i oh i picked the minimum

388
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
the three and i oh i picked the minimum
 

389
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,670
the three and i oh i picked the minimum
right

390
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
right
 

391
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,870
right
all right so f

392
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
all right so f
 

393
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,350
all right so f
let's define a dynamic programming

394
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
let's define a dynamic programming
 

395
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,910
let's define a dynamic programming
function

396
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
function
 

397
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,030
function
which is frc so meaning that

398
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
which is frc so meaning that
 

399
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,670
which is frc so meaning that
from the minimum pass sum

400
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680

 

401
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,550

from the from the last row yes from the

402
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
from the from the last row yes from the
 

403
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,070
from the from the last row yes from the
last row

404
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
last row
 

405
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,590
last row
okay last row to here to this point to

406
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
okay last row to here to this point to
 

407
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,389
okay last row to here to this point to
this position

408
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
this position
 

409
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,990
this position
it doesn't make sense right

410
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
it doesn't make sense right
 

411
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,990
it doesn't make sense right
does it make sense so it will be what

412
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
does it make sense so it will be what
 

413
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,190
does it make sense so it will be what
f r c equals

414
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
f r c equals
 

415
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,389
f r c equals
minimum of what

416
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
minimum of what
 

417
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,190
minimum of what
of what plus what can you can you guess

418
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
of what plus what can you can you guess
 

419
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,590
of what plus what can you can you guess
look

420
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
look
 

421
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,710
look
frc is that frc

422
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
frc is that frc
 

423
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,070
frc is that frc
is here right uh uh rc remind me of

424
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
is here right uh uh rc remind me of
 

425
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,949
is here right uh uh rc remind me of
cheese

426
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
cheese
 

427
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,230
cheese
look it's coming from what

428
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
look it's coming from what
 

429
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,910
look it's coming from what
can it come from what connect two

430
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
can it come from what connect two
 

431
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,990
can it come from what connect two
possibilities

432
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
possibilities
 

433
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,350
possibilities
two angles no i mean um and r

434
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
two angles no i mean um and r
 

435
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,470
two angles no i mean um and r
c and what is next is r plus one

436
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
c and what is next is r plus one
 

437
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,509
c and what is next is r plus one
c and also is next r plus one c plus one

438
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
c and also is next r plus one c plus one
 

439
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,230
c and also is next r plus one c plus one
right

440
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
right
 

441
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,389
right
right because it can only come from this

442
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
right because it can only come from this
 

443
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,470
right because it can only come from this
position if i want to

444
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
position if i want to
 

445
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,430
position if i want to
the starting point is look the starting

446
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
the starting point is look the starting
 

447
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,949
the starting point is look the starting
point is at the last row

448
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
point is at the last row
 

449
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,630
point is at the last row
and it's like climbing right you can

450
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
and it's like climbing right you can
 

451
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,590
and it's like climbing right you can
climb you can climb in

452
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
climb you can climb in
 

453
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,030
climb you can climb in
climb up right or you can climb

454
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
climb up right or you can climb
 

455
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,190
climb up right or you can climb
kind of this way right so you can climb

456
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
kind of this way right so you can climb
 

457
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,470
kind of this way right so you can climb
from the bottom to the

458
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
from the bottom to the
 

459
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,430
from the bottom to the
upwards you can have two positions right

460
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
upwards you can have two positions right
 

461
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,790
upwards you can have two positions right
so minimum

462
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
so minimum
 

463
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,870
so minimum
at this point rc could come from two

464
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
at this point rc could come from two
 

465
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,389
at this point rc could come from two
position which f

466
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
position which f
 

467
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,150
position which f
r plus one c and one and can you tell me

468
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
r plus one c and one and can you tell me
 

469
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,750
r plus one c and one and can you tell me
what's here

470
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
what's here
 

471
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,790
what's here
i was just saying ah rc

472
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
i was just saying ah rc
 

473
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,389
i was just saying ah rc
this position is rc and it comes from

474
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
this position is rc and it comes from
 

475
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,750
this position is rc and it comes from
what

476
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
what
 

477
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,590
what
r plus one c and what's this position

478
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
r plus one c and what's this position
 

479
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,870
r plus one c and what's this position
what's this partition

480
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880

 

481
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,910

r plus one c plus one where down

482
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
r plus one c plus one where down
 

483
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,030
r plus one c plus one where down
look so f r plus one c plus one

484
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
look so f r plus one c plus one
 

485
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,030
look so f r plus one c plus one
but look it coming from this this is the

486
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
but look it coming from this this is the
 

487
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,389
but look it coming from this this is the
past sum yeah but

488
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
past sum yeah but
 

489
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,150
past sum yeah but
when i reach here i need to end the

490
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
when i reach here i need to end the
 

491
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,230
when i reach here i need to end the
number of current point right

492
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
number of current point right
 

493
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,550
number of current point right
yeah so let's define it as t rc right

494
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
yeah so let's define it as t rc right
 

495
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,350
yeah so let's define it as t rc right
yeah okay so the final value is what

496
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
yeah okay so the final value is what
 

497
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,630
yeah okay so the final value is what
the minimum plus sum with which is what

498
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:04,640
the minimum plus sum with which is what
 

499
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,870
the minimum plus sum with which is what
which is the value we want to find is f

500
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
which is the value we want to find is f
 

501
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,389
which is the value we want to find is f
or what

502
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
or what
 

503
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,750
or what
the top value zero what

504
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
the top value zero what
 

505
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,190
the top value zero what
because the top row yeah zero one

506
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
because the top row yeah zero one
 

507
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,030
because the top row yeah zero one
zero yeah this is the value we're

508
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
zero yeah this is the value we're
 

509
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,949
zero yeah this is the value we're
looking for when we calculate this yeah

510
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
looking for when we calculate this yeah
 

511
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,150
looking for when we calculate this yeah
each value is the minimum of its next

512
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
each value is the minimum of its next
 

513
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,430
each value is the minimum of its next
row two values

514
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
row two values
 

515
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,310
row two values
right plus its value of itself am i

516
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
right plus its value of itself am i
 

517
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,190
right plus its value of itself am i
right

518
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
right
 

519
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,310
right
it's like picking picking

520
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
it's like picking picking
 

521
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,190
it's like picking picking
uh score picking numbers on when you

522
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
uh score picking numbers on when you
 

523
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,990
uh score picking numbers on when you
climb up

524
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
climb up
 

525
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,430
climb up
right yeah can they get it because

526
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
right yeah can they get it because
 

527
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,470
right yeah can they get it because
how many how many numbers the past sum

528
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
how many how many numbers the past sum
 

529
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,350
how many how many numbers the past sum
have you picked

530
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
have you picked
 

531
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,389
have you picked
previously with these two right and what

532
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
previously with these two right and what
 

533
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,310
previously with these two right and what
can you pick from the current position

534
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
can you pick from the current position
 

535
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,350
can you pick from the current position
is these two

536
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
is these two
 

537
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,990
is these two
am right so what's the minimum strategy

538
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
am right so what's the minimum strategy
 

539
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,550
am right so what's the minimum strategy
i want to

540
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
i want to
 

541
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,870
i want to
at this point i always pick the smallest

542
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
at this point i always pick the smallest
 

543
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,790
at this point i always pick the smallest
right

544
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
right
 

545
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,710
right
because i pick a small list that comes

546
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
because i pick a small list that comes
 

547
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,230
because i pick a small list that comes
that's a small that's the

548
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
that's a small that's the
 

549
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,870
that's a small that's the
ultimate strategy and i attempt it i'm

550
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
ultimate strategy and i attempt it i'm
 

551
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,670
ultimate strategy and i attempt it i'm
going to add it

552
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
going to add it
 

553
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,150
going to add it
with current numbers right does it make

554
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
with current numbers right does it make
 

555
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,949
with current numbers right does it make
sense eric

556
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
sense eric
 

557
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,870
sense eric
yeah can you explain again

558
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880

 

559
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,629

so uh you wanna find

560
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
so uh you wanna find
 

561
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,790

[Music]
 

569
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,590
[Music]
r plus one c and this is our first one

570
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
r plus one c and this is our first one

575
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,750

is this one one yeah so basically look

576
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
is this one one yeah so basically look
 

577
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,310
is this one one yeah so basically look
you want to find a minimum per sum yeah

578
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
you want to find a minimum per sum yeah
 

579
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,110
you want to find a minimum per sum yeah
yeah

580
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
yeah
 

581
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,190
yeah
person from the top to the bottom yeah

582
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
person from the top to the bottom yeah
 

583
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,430
person from the top to the bottom yeah
yeah you see the same as from the bottom

584
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
yeah you see the same as from the bottom
 

585
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,350
yeah you see the same as from the bottom
to the top

586
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
to the top
 

587
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,150
to the top
right it's the same yeah you want to add

588
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
right it's the same yeah you want to add
 

589
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,990
right it's the same yeah you want to add
a number find the minimum pass

590
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
a number find the minimum pass
 

591
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,190
a number find the minimum pass
picking sign the medium plus sum from

592
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
picking sign the medium plus sum from
 

593
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,110
picking sign the medium plus sum from
top to the bottom is the same as from

594
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
top to the bottom is the same as from
 

595
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,230
top to the bottom is the same as from
water to the pub yeah it's like eric is

596
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
water to the pub yeah it's like eric is
 

597
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,710
water to the pub yeah it's like eric is
here

598
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
here
 

599
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,790
here
ryan can pick here or here you can start

600
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
ryan can pick here or here you can start
 

601
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,870
ryan can pick here or here you can start
with any position at the last row yeah

602
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
with any position at the last row yeah
 

603
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,670
with any position at the last row yeah
and you can climb it up yeah look you

604
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
and you can climb it up yeah look you
 

605
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,470
and you can climb it up yeah look you
are here

606
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
are here
 

607
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,790
are here
you can come here and then you can climb

608
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
you can come here and then you can climb
 

609
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,870
you can come here and then you can climb
here when you climb here you you have

610
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
here when you climb here you you have
 

611
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,629
here when you climb here you you have
four plus two which is six

612
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,639
four plus two which is six
 

613
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,230
four plus two which is six
when you come here you have four plus

614
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
when you come here you have four plus
 

615
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,069
when you come here you have four plus
five is it's nine

616
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
five is it's nine
 

617
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,710
five is it's nine
right yeah so here when at this point

618
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
right yeah so here when at this point
 

619
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,670
right yeah so here when at this point
you will be nine

620
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
you will be nine
 

621
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,430
you will be nine
here and then you'll be six here and

622
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
here and then you'll be six here and
 

623
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,550
here and then you'll be six here and
then here you can say

624
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
then here you can say
 

625
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,629
then here you can say
but but look six this is six but here

626
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
but but look six this is six but here
 

627
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,590
but but look six this is six but here
look three plus

628
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
look three plus
 

629
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,069
look three plus
two is five it's well if you want to

630
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
two is five it's well if you want to
 

631
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,110
two is five it's well if you want to
reach this point

632
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
reach this point
 

633
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,550
reach this point
it's better you pick this one because

634
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
it's better you pick this one because
 

635
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,629
it's better you pick this one because
this is five right yeah

636
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
this is five right yeah
 

637
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,790
this is five right yeah
two plus this is smaller so you put five

638
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
two plus this is smaller so you put five
 

639
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,110
two plus this is smaller so you put five
right here so find a knife

640
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
right here so find a knife
 

641
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,550
right here so find a knife
you want to climb to the top you pick

642
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
you want to climb to the top you pick
 

643
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,550
you want to climb to the top you pick
which which way

644
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
which which way
 

645
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,470
which which way
you pick which way when we were

646
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
you pick which way when we were
 

647
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,470
you pick which way when we were
yeah this is fine this is nice you want

648
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
yeah this is fine this is nice you want
 

649
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,590
yeah this is fine this is nice you want
to come up to the top

650
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
to come up to the top
 

651
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,310
to come up to the top
which way you want to five five because

652
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
which way you want to five five because
 

653
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,110
which way you want to five five because
yes overall

654
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
yes overall
 

655
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,189
yes overall
five plus one is six and nine plus one

656
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
five plus one is six and nine plus one
 

657
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,710
five plus one is six and nine plus one
is ten so you predict

658
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
is ten so you predict
 

659
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,590
is ten so you predict
the optimum is one plus two plus three

660
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
the optimum is one plus two plus three
 

661
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,509
the optimum is one plus two plus three
got it doesn't make sense

662
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
got it doesn't make sense
 

663
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,030
got it doesn't make sense
why can't we do it because when you

664
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
why can't we do it because when you
 

665
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,910
why can't we do it because when you
reach this point i don't care how many

666
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
reach this point i don't care how many
 

667
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,990
reach this point i don't care how many
how many parts you reach this point i

668
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
how many parts you reach this point i
 

669
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,670
how many parts you reach this point i
always pick the smallest

670
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
always pick the smallest
 

671
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,629
always pick the smallest
so for the following any step for the

672
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
so for the following any step for the
 

673
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,110
so for the following any step for the
one

674
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
one
 

675
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,470
one
right it doesn't care how many ways you

676
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
right it doesn't care how many ways you
 

677
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:26,870
right it doesn't care how many ways you
can

678
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
can
 

679
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,750
can
you calculate before two you always the

680
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
you calculate before two you always the
 

681
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,030
you calculate before two you always the
smallest which is

682
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
smallest which is
 

683
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,150
smallest which is
which is five two plus three yeah got it

684
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
which is five two plus three yeah got it
 

685
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,790
which is five two plus three yeah got it
doesn't make sense yeah okay so look

686
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
doesn't make sense yeah okay so look
 

687
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,470
doesn't make sense yeah okay so look
this is the minimum function okay this

688
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
this is the minimum function okay this
 

689
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,870
this is the minimum function okay this
is the

690
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
is the
 

691
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,829
is the
dynamic transition function right got it

692
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
dynamic transition function right got it
 

693
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,590
dynamic transition function right got it
okay

694
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
okay
 

695
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,670
okay
let's do this away do this one more time

696
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
let's do this away do this one more time
 

697
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,949
let's do this away do this one more time
so

698
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
so
 

699
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,750
so
you know how we're doing it let me do

700
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
you know how we're doing it let me do
 

701
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,150
you know how we're doing it let me do
one

702
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
one
 

703
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,189
one
okay look all right look

704
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
okay look all right look
 

705
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,350
okay look all right look
let's see let's go in from these the

706
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
let's see let's go in from these the
 

707
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,590
let's see let's go in from these the
last row to the top row okay and we want

708
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
last row to the top row okay and we want
 

709
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,550
last row to the top row okay and we want
to calculate

710
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
to calculate
 

711
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,550
to calculate
the minimum what's the minimum what was

712
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
the minimum what's the minimum what was
 

713
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,910
the minimum what's the minimum what was
number three which is

714
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
number three which is
 

715
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,590
number three which is
nine yeah yeah you remember this and

716
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
nine yeah yeah you remember this and
 

717
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,310
nine yeah yeah you remember this and
that's how we get it okay

718
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
that's how we get it okay
 

719
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,990
that's how we get it okay
four look here he's four yeah

720
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
four look here he's four yeah
 

721
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,590
four look here he's four yeah
three and eight eleven which is smaller

722
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
three and eight eleven which is smaller
 

723
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,710
three and eight eleven which is smaller
three three three plus four

724
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
three three three plus four
 

725
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,069
three three three plus four
equals seven right seven

726
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
equals seven right seven
 

727
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,110
equals seven right seven
here five and eight and ten which is

728
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
here five and eight and ten which is
 

729
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,389
here five and eight and ten which is
smaller

730
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
smaller
 

731
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,749
smaller
eight a plus five thirteen

732
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:29,759
eight a plus five thirteen
 

733
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,749
eight a plus five thirteen
thirteen okay and here

734
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:33,759

 

735
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,990

seven and thirteen which is smaller

736
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
seven and thirteen which is smaller
 

737
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,790
seven and thirteen which is smaller
seven

738
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
seven
 

739
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,990
seven
seven plus two nice so this is

740
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
seven plus two nice so this is
 

741
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,710
seven plus two nice so this is
the optimum got it does it make sense

742
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
the optimum got it does it make sense
 

743
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,030
the optimum got it does it make sense
yeah

744
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
yeah
 

745
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,069
yeah
so for any large triangle i don't care i

746
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
so for any large triangle i don't care i
 

747
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,030
so for any large triangle i don't care i
just do this

748
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
just do this
 

749
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,509
just do this
from top to the top right because this

750
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
from top to the top right because this
 

751
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,790
from top to the top right because this
is always

752
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,800
is always
 

753
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,189
is always
satisfied this is always the dynamic

754
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
satisfied this is always the dynamic
 

755
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,670
satisfied this is always the dynamic
programming translation function

756
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
programming translation function
 

757
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,189
programming translation function
what's the advantage compared to the

758
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
what's the advantage compared to the
 

759
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,389
what's the advantage compared to the
profiles look previously

760
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
profiles look previously
 

761
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,590
profiles look previously
they might be a lot of paths coming

762
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
they might be a lot of paths coming
 

763
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,550
they might be a lot of paths coming
through right

764
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
through right
 

765
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,189
through right
duplicate path am right look look

766
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
duplicate path am right look look
 

767
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,110
duplicate path am right look look
previously if you don't remember eric

768
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
previously if you don't remember eric
 

769
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,509
previously if you don't remember eric
look

770
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
look
 

771
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,150
look
if you if you don't remember the uh

772
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
if you if you don't remember the uh
 

773
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,110
if you if you don't remember the uh
don't memorize

774
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
don't memorize
 

775
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,910
don't memorize
the the past sum till this point and you

776
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
the the past sum till this point and you
 

777
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,590
the the past sum till this point and you
may calculate

778
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
may calculate
 

779
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,509
may calculate
again and again for example look you

780
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
again and again for example look you
 

781
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,949
again and again for example look you
calculate here

782
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
calculate here
 

783
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,670
calculate here
for example here is 10 right and then

784
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
for example here is 10 right and then
 

785
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,189
for example here is 10 right and then
you want to calculate here you get the

786
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
you want to calculate here you get the
 

787
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,629
you want to calculate here you get the
one and the two and the three and the

788
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
one and the two and the three and the
 

789
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,269
one and the two and the three and the
four

790
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
four
 

791
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,110
four
but again for each person you need to

792
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,120
but again for each person you need to
 

793
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,030
but again for each person you need to
calculate this over and over and over

794
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
calculate this over and over and over
 

795
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,509
calculate this over and over and over
again

796
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
again
 

797
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,430
again
but for now i don't calculate over and

798
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
but for now i don't calculate over and
 

799
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,110
but for now i don't calculate over and
over again i just save it in

800
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
over again i just save it in
 

801
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,470
over again i just save it in
frc and i can just use pick the minimum

802
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
frc and i can just use pick the minimum
 

803
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,670
frc and i can just use pick the minimum
right so it will be a lot faster right

804
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
right so it will be a lot faster right
 

805
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,629
right so it will be a lot faster right
does it make sense because this part is

806
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
does it make sense because this part is
 

807
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,509
does it make sense because this part is
fixed

808
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519
fixed
 

809
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,509
fixed
yeah once i kick your id i don't need to

810
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
yeah once i kick your id i don't need to
 

811
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,829
yeah once i kick your id i don't need to
calculate again

812
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839
calculate again
 

813
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,590
calculate again
okay let me do one

814
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
okay let me do one
 

815
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,080
okay let me do one
okay seven

816
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,090
okay seven

one plus eight nine i put a nine here
 

837
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,909
one plus eight nine i put a nine here
three and six pick the smallest one

838
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
three and six pick the smallest one
 

839
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,390
three and six pick the smallest one
three three minus three

840
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
three three minus three
 

841
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,110
three three minus three
zero yeah zero and nine pick the

842
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
zero yeah zero and nine pick the
 

843
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,830
zero yeah zero and nine pick the
smallest

844
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:41,840
smallest
 

845
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,310
smallest
zero zero plus seven seven so if the

846
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
zero zero plus seven seven so if the
 

847
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,590
zero zero plus seven seven so if the
number is fair

848
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
number is fair
 

849
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,230
number is fair
yeah got it does it make sense yeah yeah

850
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
yeah got it does it make sense yeah yeah
 

851
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,190
yeah got it does it make sense yeah yeah
okay so

852
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
okay so
 

853
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,750
okay so
this is smaller maybe you can just try

854
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760
this is smaller maybe you can just try
 

855
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,830
this is smaller maybe you can just try
every positive part but if a

856
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
every positive part but if a
 

857
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,230
every positive part but if a
triangle it has a half a thousand a

858
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
triangle it has a half a thousand a
 

859
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,909
triangle it has a half a thousand a
million lines

860
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919
million lines
 

861
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,990
million lines
then it's not feasible right yeah you

862
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
then it's not feasible right yeah you
 

863
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,590
then it's not feasible right yeah you
don't know which one but you can always

864
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:01,600
don't know which one but you can always
 

865
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,789
don't know which one but you can always
try this strategy

866
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
try this strategy
 

867
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,270
try this strategy
from the bottom line right and build

868
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
from the bottom line right and build
 

869
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,070
from the bottom line right and build
this

870
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
this
 

871
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,789
this
dynamic programming metric along to the

872
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
dynamic programming metric along to the
 

873
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,110
dynamic programming metric along to the
top

874
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
top
 

875
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,230
top
right correct yeah okay look this one

876
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
right correct yeah okay look this one
 

877
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,669
right correct yeah okay look this one
how many dynamic programming are we

878
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
how many dynamic programming are we
 

879
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,789
how many dynamic programming are we
talking about

880
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799

 

881
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,270

i asked this question though uh

882
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
i asked this question though uh
 

883
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,909
i asked this question though uh
countdown

884
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
countdown
 

885
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,510
countdown
wasn't enough yeah okay define let's try

886
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
wasn't enough yeah okay define let's try
 

887
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:23,830
wasn't enough yeah okay define let's try
this

888
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:23,840
this
 

889
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,830
this
f r c okay

890
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
f r c okay
 

891
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,390
f r c okay
if okay let's say let's say

892
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400

 

893
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,070

if ah equal let's define a number

894
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
if ah equal let's define a number
 

895
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,430
if ah equal let's define a number
define the mean mean cost

896
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
define the mean mean cost
 

897
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,830
define the mean mean cost
okay mean cost mean per sum and mean

898
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
okay mean cost mean per sum and mean
 

899
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,029
okay mean cost mean per sum and mean
plus sum

900
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039

 

901
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,029

and then we we are given a metric we

902
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
and then we we are given a metric we
 

903
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,310
and then we we are given a metric we
which we have uh

904
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
which we have uh
 

905
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,310
which we have uh
we will call it t okay triangle okay

906
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
we will call it t okay triangle okay
 

907
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,590
we will call it t okay triangle okay
column all right

908
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
column all right
 

909
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,029
column all right
if r equals the last length yeah the

910
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
if r equals the last length yeah the
 

911
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,909
if r equals the last length yeah the
the last row which is length t right

912
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
the last row which is length t right
 

913
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,590
the last row which is length t right
minus one yeah because it starts from

914
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
minus one yeah because it starts from
 

915
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,870
minus one yeah because it starts from
zero okay

916
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
zero okay
 

917
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,950
zero okay
yeah if it's the last row then what we

918
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
yeah if it's the last row then what we
 

919
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,150
yeah if it's the last row then what we
took would it have

920
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,160
took would it have
 

921
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,430
took would it have
if you only last longer will return if

922
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
if you only last longer will return if
 

923
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,029
if you only last longer will return if
you are adding this triangle and the

924
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
you are adding this triangle and the
 

925
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,350
you are adding this triangle and the
last row what should we return

926
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
last row what should we return
 

927
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,110
last row what should we return
return r the value as

928
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
return r the value as
 

929
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,390
return r the value as
here right yeah so it's t r

930
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
here right yeah so it's t r
 

931
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,549
here right yeah so it's t r
c right yeah all right yeah otherwise

932
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
c right yeah all right yeah otherwise
 

933
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,470
c right yeah all right yeah otherwise
i'll return one if it's not in the last

934
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
i'll return one if it's not in the last
 

935
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,110
i'll return one if it's not in the last
row then

936
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
row then
 

937
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,350
row then
we return what minimum of

938
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
we return what minimum of
 

939
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,710
we return what minimum of
f f1 alright i just told you

940
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:34,720
f f1 alright i just told you
 

941
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,840
f f1 alright i just told you
oh uh uh oh wait let

942
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:40,850

945
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,710

in here you need to pick up value which

946
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:52,720
in here you need to pick up value which
 

947
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,669
in here you need to pick up value which
is

948
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
is
 

949
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,669
is
our trc yeah this is the value yeah

950
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
our trc yeah this is the value yeah
 

951
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,870
our trc yeah this is the value yeah
all right yeah i'm okay what's missing

952
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
all right yeah i'm okay what's missing
 

953
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,909
all right yeah i'm okay what's missing
here

954
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
here
 

955
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,390
here
cash cash because if you're not doing

956
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
cash cash because if you're not doing
 

957
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,350
cash cash because if you're not doing
the cash

958
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
the cash
 

959
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,190
the cash
what happened if you're not putting this

960
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
what happened if you're not putting this
 

961
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,870
what happened if you're not putting this
what happened we'll take

962
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
what happened we'll take
 

963
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,470
what happened we'll take
that will be the blue force we just

964
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:10,480
that will be the blue force we just
 

965
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,270
that will be the blue force we just
talked about right yeah that would be

966
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,280
talked about right yeah that would be
 

967
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,350
talked about right yeah that would be
that for example now if you calculate

968
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
that for example now if you calculate
 

969
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,270
that for example now if you calculate
something in

970
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
something in
 

971
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,590
something in
r divided by 2c divided by two that will

972
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
r divided by 2c divided by two that will
 

973
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,549
r divided by 2c divided by two that will
be

974
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
be
 

975
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,430
be
maybe many many many times you want to

976
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
maybe many many many times you want to
 

977
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,190
maybe many many many times you want to
calculate this function again and again

978
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
calculate this function again and again
 

979
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,870
calculate this function again and again
again and again so now what's the time

980
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
again and again so now what's the time
 

981
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,630
again and again so now what's the time
complexity if you

982
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640
complexity if you
 

983
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,710
complexity if you
if you add this cache what's the time

984
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
if you add this cache what's the time
 

985
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,830
if you add this cache what's the time
complexity

986
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:32,840
complexity
 

987
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,590
complexity
i quite fast

988
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
i quite fast
 

989
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,470
i quite fast
oh what how many how many values are we

990
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
oh what how many how many values are we
 

991
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,789
oh what how many how many values are we
need

992
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799
need
 

993
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,750
need
uh do we need to calculate the r and c

994
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:41,760
uh do we need to calculate the r and c
 

995
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,149
uh do we need to calculate the r and c
ah

996
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
ah
 

997
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,590
ah
time c or ltc i think probably

998
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
time c or ltc i think probably
 

999
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,710
time c or ltc i think probably
not probably come on there are

1000
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
not probably come on there are
 

1001
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,270
not probably come on there are
let's see how many what's that what's

1002
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,280
let's see how many what's that what's
 

1003
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,750
let's see how many what's that what's
the area of this triangle if this is r

1004
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:53,760
the area of this triangle if this is r
 

1005
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,710
the area of this triangle if this is r
this is c

1006
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
this is c
 

1007
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,669
this is c
times no probability is times okay

1008
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:57,679
times no probability is times okay
 

1009
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,710
times no probability is times okay
remember

1010
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
remember
 

1011
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,590
remember
come on this is a this is a square r and

1012
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
come on this is a this is a square r and
 

1013
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,909
come on this is a this is a square r and
c what's the area what's the area

1014
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:03,919
c what's the area what's the area
 

1015
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,230
c what's the area what's the area
of the area yeah area what's right there

1016
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
of the area yeah area what's right there
 

1017
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,470
of the area yeah area what's right there
area is the inside

1018
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,480
area is the inside
 

1019
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,669
area is the inside
yeah how how many r times yeah

1020
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
yeah how how many r times yeah
 

1021
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,350
yeah how how many r times yeah
yeah what's the triangle i can see

1022
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
yeah what's the triangle i can see
 

1023
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,470
yeah what's the triangle i can see
divided by two right yeah because it's

1024
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
divided by two right yeah because it's
 

1025
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,669
divided by two right yeah because it's
half of it right

1026
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
half of it right
 

1027
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,270
half of it right
r times c and this is hard times two

1028
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,280
r times c and this is hard times two
 

1029
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,190
r times c and this is hard times two
right about we drop a constant so it's r

1030
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,200
right about we drop a constant so it's r
 

1031
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,230
right about we drop a constant so it's r
times c

1032
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
times c
 

1033
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,990
times c
if we're not adding the cache what's the

1034
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
if we're not adding the cache what's the
 

1035
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,870
if we're not adding the cache what's the
time complexity

1036
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880

 

1037
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,270

right yeah because each each row you

1038
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,280
right yeah because each each row you
 

1039
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:35,990
right yeah because each each row you
have a

1040
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,000
have a
 

1041
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,390
have a
waffle here yeah exponential am right if

1042
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:40,400
waffle here yeah exponential am right if
 

1043
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,070
waffle here yeah exponential am right if
if i and c equal if i equals c right

1044
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
if i and c equal if i equals c right
 

1045
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,710
if i and c equal if i equals c right
what i think you could see yeah okay

1046
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
what i think you could see yeah okay
 

1047
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,870
what i think you could see yeah okay
so now what's the another

1048
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
so now what's the another
 

1049
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,390
so now what's the another
approach we're talking about

1050
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400

 

1051
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,230

yeah so

1052
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240

 

1053
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,549

so i think the top down is easier to

1054
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
so i think the top down is easier to
 

1055
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,149
so i think the top down is easier to
implement i'm right

1056
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
implement i'm right
 

1057
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,549
implement i'm right
am right yeah because top down we can

1058
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
am right yeah because top down we can
 

1059
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,029
am right yeah because top down we can
usually implement it using recursion

1060
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,039
usually implement it using recursion
 

1061
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,310
usually implement it using recursion
recursion with what top down

1062
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
recursion with what top down
 

1063
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,470
recursion with what top down
minimization minimization with the

1064

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,750
minimization minimization with the
notebook to remember it right

1066
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:19,760
notebook to remember it right
 

1067
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,950
notebook to remember it right
define uh let's just say mean no no no

1068
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:22,960
define uh let's just say mean no no no
 

1069
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,190
define uh let's just say mean no no no
mean past some

1070
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,200

 

1071
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:38,310

[Music]

1072
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320

 

1073
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,830

right okay so look let's let's

1074
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
right okay so look let's let's
 

1075
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,350
right okay so look let's let's
define uh we can we can we can

1076
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
define uh we can we can we can
 

1077
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,350
define uh we can we can we can
put a value updated value in a triangle

1078
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,360
put a value updated value in a triangle
 

1079
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,190
put a value updated value in a triangle
so let's do for

1080
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,200
so let's do for
 

1081
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,590
so let's do for
row in range we want to start with the

1082
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,600
row in range we want to start with the
 

1083
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,149
row in range we want to start with the
second to last row right all right all

1084
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
second to last row right all right all
 

1085
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:56,710
second to last row right all right all
right

1086
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
right
 

1087
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,350
right
so it's rows the second row is the last

1088
00:22:59,350 --> 00:22:59,360
so it's rows the second row is the last
 

1089
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,669
so it's rows the second row is the last
row is rows minus one right

1090
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
row is rows minus one right
 

1091
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,430
row is rows minus one right
the second to the last row is rows one

1092
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:06,440

 

1093
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,430

second is raised at

1094
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
second is raised at
 

1095
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,190
second is raised at
nine minus what

1096
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
nine minus what
 

1097
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,549
nine minus what
-1 is the second last row minus what is

1098
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
-1 is the second last row minus what is
 

1099
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,190
-1 is the second last row minus what is
the second

1100
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
the second
 

1101
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,950
the second
last row minus

1102
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:20,960
last row minus
 

1103
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,990
last row minus
come on this is rose minus one so what's

1104
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
come on this is rose minus one so what's
 

1105
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,870
come on this is rose minus one so what's
this

1106
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
this
 

1107
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,149
this
rose one minus two yes come on

1108
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:28,159
rose one minus two yes come on
 

1109
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,630
rose one minus two yes come on
what's what's the and what's the top one

1110
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
what's what's the and what's the top one
 

1111
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,830
what's what's the and what's the top one
is yellow right

1112
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
is yellow right
 

1113
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,990
is yellow right
so about we have to fit it is minus one

1114
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
so about we have to fit it is minus one
 

1115
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,950
so about we have to fit it is minus one
because it's the

1116
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:34,960
because it's the
 

1117
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,789
because it's the
up two right remember this range

1118
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,799
up two right remember this range
 

1119
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,669
up two right remember this range
function yeah when you pull the range

1120
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
function yeah when you pull the range
 

1121
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,750
function yeah when you pull the range
range three five what happened all right

1122
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:41,760
range three five what happened all right
 

1123
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,590
range three five what happened all right
range three five how many numbers are in

1124
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:43,600
range three five how many numbers are in
 

1125
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,190
range three five how many numbers are in
there

1126
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,200
there
 

1127
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:53,830
there
oh fifteen no no no stop

1128
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840

 

1129
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,070

yeah so it's three and four but not not

1130
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,080
yeah so it's three and four but not not
 

1131
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,110
yeah so it's three and four but not not
including five right

1132
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
including five right
 

1133
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,830
including five right
yeah but you can do this negative so

1134
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
yeah but you can do this negative so
 

1135
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,110
yeah but you can do this negative so
it's three

1136
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,120
it's three
 

1137
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,390
it's three
minus one minus one

1138
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
minus one minus one
 

1139
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,070
minus one minus one
range this is step so

1140
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
range this is step so
 

1141
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,430
range this is step so
so what's this range

1142
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
so what's this range
 

1143
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,549
so what's this range
so what what's the value range what we

1144
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
so what what's the value range what we
 

1145
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,029
so what what's the value range what we
get three and then what's next

1146
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:19,039
get three and then what's next
 

1147
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,250
get three and then what's next
sorry

1148
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,260

minus minus one three minus one is one

1152
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
minus minus one three minus one is one
 

1153
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,830
minus minus one three minus one is one
two and then what's next one and what's

1154
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:30,840
two and then what's next one and what's
 

1155
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,789
two and then what's next one and what's
next

1156
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
next
 

1157
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,470
next
0 and what's next minus 1

1158
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,480
0 and what's next minus 1
 

1159
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,390
0 and what's next minus 1
but not including minus 1 right this is

1160
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
but not including minus 1 right this is
 

1161
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,830
but not including minus 1 right this is
always the value

1162
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
always the value
 

1163
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,350
always the value
before this right so 3 minus 1 minus 1

1164
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,360
before this right so 3 minus 1 minus 1
 

1165
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,110
before this right so 3 minus 1 minus 1
is actually 4 values 3 2

1166

c in range look
 

1203
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,029
c in range look
the line will be length

1204
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:37,039
the line will be length
 

1205
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,510
the line will be length
then uh t t r right because t

1206
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
then uh t t r right because t
 

1207
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,070
then uh t t r right because t
this row right okay look

1208
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080

 

1209
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,350

t ah c

t ah c
 

1211
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,070
t ah c
equals what all right plc equals one

1212
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,080
equals what all right plc equals one
 

1213
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,789
equals what all right plc equals one
mean one

1214
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799

yeah so actually trc you can just add

1222
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
yeah so actually trc you can just add
 

1223
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,029
yeah so actually trc you can just add
add equal right

1224
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:23,039
add equal right
 

1225
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,789
add equal right
and add equal and equals please value

1226
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:26,799
and add equal and equals please value
 

1227
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,590
and add equal and equals please value
right

1228
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
right
 

1229
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,909
right
and then return which one written what

1230
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:29,919
and then return which one written what
 

1231
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,510
and then return which one written what
value our we are looking for

1232
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
value our we are looking for
 

1233
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,269
value our we are looking for
we can work with a minimum

1234
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:35,279
we can work with a minimum
 

1235
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:42,310
we can work with a minimum
return which value is the minimum person

1236
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320

 

1237
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,269

we are calculating from here to here so

1238
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:45,279
we are calculating from here to here so
 

1239
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:45,830
we are calculating from here to here so
what's the

1240
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,840
what's the
 

1241
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:54,230
what's the
last value

1242
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,240

 

1243
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,789

come on i just told you come on remember

1244
00:26:58,789 --> 00:26:58,799

 

1245
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,549

t 0 0 yeah yeah previously like

1246
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
t 0 0 yeah yeah previously like
 

1247
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,430
t 0 0 yeah yeah previously like
remember the f function rc right so

1248
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
remember the f function rc right so
 

1249
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,549
remember the f function rc right so
what's the value

1250
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:06,559
what's the value
 

1251
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,310
what's the value
is you need to return return f zero zero

1252
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
is you need to return return f zero zero
 

1253
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,390
is you need to return return f zero zero
right

1254
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
right
 

1255
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,590
right
when the top down the top down dynamic

1256
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
when the top down the top down dynamic
 

1257
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,390
when the top down the top down dynamic
programming you

1258
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
programming you
 

1259
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,789
programming you
you return f zero zero right but this

1260
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
you return f zero zero right but this
 

1261
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,630
you return f zero zero right but this
one top out

1262
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:20,640
one top out
 

1263
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,430
one top out
the final value is on the top come on

1264
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:23,440
the final value is on the top come on
 

1265
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,389
the final value is on the top come on
does it make sense

1266
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:24,399
does it make sense
 

1267
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,269
does it make sense
yeah okay now i'm going to

1268
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
yeah okay now i'm going to
 

1269
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,110
yeah okay now i'm going to
erase it okay remember okay

1270
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,120
erase it okay remember okay
 

1271
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,669
erase it okay remember okay
i'm going to erase all of it be here

1272
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:35,679
i'm going to erase all of it be here
 

1273
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,269
i'm going to erase all of it be here
come on

1274
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:37,279
come on
 

1275
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,070
come on
return t i i write this for you okay t

1276
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
return t i i write this for you okay t
 

1277
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,470
return t i i write this for you okay t
zero

1278
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,480
zero
 

1279
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,110
zero
zero i i didn't know the beginning what

1280
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,120
zero i i didn't know the beginning what
 

1281
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,990
zero i i didn't know the beginning what
do you know

1282
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,000
do you know
 

1283
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:55,190
do you know
p t r c okay okay

1285
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,470

trc we want to update the value in trc

1286
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:58,480
trc we want to update the value in trc
 

1287
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,630
trc we want to update the value in trc
yeah so what does it equal you need to

1288
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
yeah so what does it equal you need to
 

1289
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,830
yeah so what does it equal you need to
pick the value from the

1290
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:01,840
pick the value from the
 

1291
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,430
pick the value from the
next row or equal to

1292
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:05,440
next row or equal to
 

1293
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,549
next row or equal to
eight okay three yeah

1294
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
eight okay three yeah
 

1295
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,110
eight okay three yeah
okay

1296
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,120

 

1297
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,669

yeah keep going rc

1298

yeah keep going rc
 

1299
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,590
yeah keep going rc
you want to pick the minimum right oh

1300
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,600
you want to pick the minimum right oh
 

1301
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,350
you want to pick the minimum right oh
yeah i forgot min

1302
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
yeah i forgot min
 

1303
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,950
yeah i forgot min
i forgot your l equal here

1304
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
i forgot your l equal here
 

1305
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,389
i forgot your l equal here
because you want to pick the current

1306
