1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,919
hello exactly

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,560
all right yeah so today we want to talk

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:10,559
about this what is the database

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,960
any idea database where you store data

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,280
where we started where you saw data base

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,400
what space i mean it's a place where we

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,400
started okay that could be it okay so

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,240
database uh

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,960
yeah it's related to computer obviously

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,720
research pokemon database

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,640
excellent yeah you search online yeah

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,720
you use the browser to search the

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,680
procurement database so database is the

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,000
place where we organize data yesterday

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,320
okay so it's a place we organize

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,320
something

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,360
okay database

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,719
okay so for example pokemon how many

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,200
pokemons are there about 905

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,360
are you sure yeah they're guessing more

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,199
905 and it's getting more there's more

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,320
they're getting pokemon scarlet and

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,960
violet

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,760
and it'll be released on

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,519
on i think it's the 8th of no 18th of

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,920
november i think okay anyway

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,439
905. which pokemon is the strongest i

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,119
mean like speed

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,119
yes are they fair okay

30
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,600
okay and what's the second strongest um

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
alternet charisma

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,119
anyway okay you already know that and

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,479
how about the third one

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,479
um

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,560
you don't know yeah it's hard right okay

36
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,240
and how about that if you want to find

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,119
out the top ten

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,960
strongest sorted by speed right for

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,759
example like speed right

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,079
well that's easy you're already lucky

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,200
so what's that ninja

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,960
says

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,439
electrode aerodactyl yeah aerodynamic

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,920
pterodactyl okay so yeah given this

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,960
scenario what i meant is that uh suppose

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,520
they have 905 so the computer needs to

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,320
know to store these data somewhere right

48
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,439
so that's the database we can install a

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,679
pokemon like image files and everywhere

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,680
right here layer but it's not easy to

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,520
find to search

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,000
right for example if i want to know the

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,680
top 10 pokemons

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,760
i mean not like

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,879
by most people okay for example like

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,040
this question

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,040
then

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,200
it's hard to to get those information

59
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,519
and then to do a query on that but

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,879
database is the place that we organize

61
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,120
these data into you know at least

62
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,360
905 pokemons for example like uh you

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,680
have you could have pokemon name

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,480
you know you could have a speed you have

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,360
a attack attack defense

66
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,280
you have different columns yeah

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,400
that's right yeah different so it's it's

68
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,680
basically we it's a table we can store

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
those

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,640
improvements in this organized data of

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,440
organized format obviously if they are

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,040
more coming then we can edit append it

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,519
at the end of table so it's like the

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,879
central centralized place okay but it

75
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,440
doesn't have to be centralized it could

76
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,959
be decentralized if i store the pokemon

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,599
let's start with a to z or a to m

78
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,560
the first one

79
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:22,319
is somewhere here and then m to z

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,959
somewhere here so basically we slipped

81
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,239
the data c and z

82
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,840
into half into two places that is the

83
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,920
snowman okay so these two places

84
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,080
okay okay what did i say so the pokemons

85
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,200
could be we could partition the

86
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,959
datas

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,760
into two so the

88
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,640
pokemon let's start with a to z

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,159
a to n the first half of alphabet we

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,879
store it in london for example and then

91
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,680
mgz we could store it in

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,840
cambridge for example okay so database

93
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,799
is a place to sum up it's a place we

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,120
store the data in an organized way we

95
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,080
can retrieve the data right from the

96
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,480
database or we can store the data

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,360
in the database we so retrieved to to

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,000
get store we could update right we could

99
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,400
append a new document or we can change

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,920
for example that these arcs we could

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,320
change the speed

102
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,680
to 100 a million right so that's a

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,280
that's a

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,639
little bit yeah

105
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,560
there are only 905 people completed

106
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,720
there's there's some more but they are

107
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,720
not completed i see

108
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,520
speed can be like a million billion

109
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,440
because

110
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,240
it depends on how many candies and how

111
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,680
you train it okay yeah okay okay yeah

112
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
yeah yeah sure

113
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,600
okay so they have a few keywords what

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,840
they tell me

115
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,639
uh database i give a few keywords which

116
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,520
is what first of all is the

117
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:56,560
organized yeah it has to be organized

118
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:59,199
station organized data and we can store

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,199
retrieve

120
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,680
over the manage right manage manages uh

121
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,080
something like uh you know we could

122
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,840
duplicate the data we could install them

123
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,560
as a store copies of that yeah we could

124
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,080
add a user like who can access the data

125
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,160
or we can have this different privilege

126
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,919
and assign the previous to people right

127
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,039
for example eric you can manage the

128
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,199
database

129
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,360
and ryan you can also manage your

130
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,440
database but mommy cannot manage the

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,199
database because she's not interested so

132
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,680
we don't have to give her the permission

133
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,400
to access the data yeah right it could

134
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,919
be you know some data storing database

135
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,440
could be confidential yeah you know

136
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,560
what's the confidence

137
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,960
cookies

138
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,360
no confidential you know what

139
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,919
secret hierarchical data cannot be

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,080
anymore yeah yeah i know confidential i

141
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,840
think confidence at least it's the word

142
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,560
to say okay data is secret

143
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,319
we

144
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,919
some people cannot access it the

145
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,680
permission for example mummy doesn't

146
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,600
have permission to access the data in

147
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,840
the database okay

148
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,160
uh this is manage store retrieve guest

149
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,919
store as i said we could insert a new

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,720
pokemon at the end of the database yeah

151
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,120
or we could update we could be big so

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,160
last few operations see that means to

153
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,360
retrieve

154
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,759
update we want to increase the speed of

155
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,280
all pokemon by 10 right this could be

156
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,000
one example

157
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,840
delete we want to delete a pokemon oh we

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,280
want to insert a program we never delete

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,919
the pokemon

160
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,440
i don't know maybe maybe a pokemon i

161
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,960
mean it's been deprecated it's gone

162
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
we found out that it's not very

163
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,440
interesting anymore like pokemon game

164
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,840
yeah pokemon go yeah yeah like pokemon

165
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,919
go often me too is not in the game now

166
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,280
yeah and also

167
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,680
yeah the database is for computers yeah

168
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,280
to store the data electronically yeah

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,440
electronically

170
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,199
you know training okay so previously we

171
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,599
have different kind of storage right now

172
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,000
nowadays the computers look how do the

173
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,759
computers remember the stuff like when

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,840
you power on

175
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,080
yeah you can still remember the stuff in

176
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,440
the middle yeah when you save a fire

177
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,919
right it remembers how by storage right

178
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,199
then previously on the you know these

179
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,199
look at this look at this this is floppy

180
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,000
properties yeah

181
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,160
floating ticks you know this take a look

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,440
this is one point four four four five

183
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
picks

184
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,479
yeah

185
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,319
it's not it's not very widely used

186
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,840
what's this

187
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,639
don't break it don't break it no no no

188
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,560
look so it's basically like uh we have a

189
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,680
this is supposed to open

190
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,919
yeah

191
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,840
i don't oh i don't have it here but

192
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,039
somehow

193
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,280
so so you see you just plug it in insert

194
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,520
it and the computer can read it it's a

195
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,520
magnet inside so don't touch it that bit

196
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,680
okay the computers have released the

197
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,479
back ahead to read from this it's very

198
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,800
slow like this yeah yeah it's very slow

199
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,800
yes

200
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
if you have a magnet right then you

201
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,720
could destroy this probably okay so

202
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,680
don't stay uh

203
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,319
stay away from magnets okay and this is

204
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
very sad thing this is uh very slow i

205
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,319
mean the computer really very so this is

206
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,639
the old technology i mean when i was

207
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,800
your age right when i was your age like

208
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,720
20 years ago we used this to store the

209
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,120
data and then it's very limited it only

210
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,919
has that

211
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,960
you know 1.44 megabytes so it's very

212
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,640
very small capacity capacity very small

213
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,120
and this one a ram

214
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,159
right look look at this the ram

215
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,279
the ram

216
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,800
where is it

217
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,000
when another ram

218
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,959
run them

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,360
random access memory so it's plugged

220
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,839
into the computer right so when it's

221
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,839
power on what's the black thing don't

222
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,320
touch it it's a magnet you know inside

223
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,519
it's a hard drive in a hard drive it has

224
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,480
this uh

225
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,360
disc

226
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,360
unless this are made of magnet

227
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,200
anyway what is this thing

228
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,080
it's a floppy disk

229
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,480
it's a old technology to store the data

230
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,320
okay so what random access memory when

231
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,240
we put this into computer when on power

232
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,680
on we can store the data but only power

233
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,040
off

234
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,640
the data on it it's gone right so this

235
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,560
is short-term memory for computer

236
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,680
instructor memory this is long-term

237
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,080
memory

238
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,880
right nowadays we have this hard drive

239
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,360
all right yeah that's right

240
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,480
um okay i show you okay maybe i have one

241
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,190
okay i have one i'll show you

242
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,399
just give me a second i have one

243
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,279
[Music]

244
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,320
oh i i have even more to show look this

245
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,480
is the

246
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
dvd yeah this is also

247
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,920
uh

248
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,080
storage okay that's this this is storage

249
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,720
for the dvd to install the data and then

250
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,000
this is hard drive look hard drive

251
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,720
all right so inside it it has a lots of

252
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,640
these disks inside when you plug into

253
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,040
the computer the computer just spin and

254
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,880
run and run and read it has this head to

255
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,640
read it very quick

256
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,040
okay read and store the data okay this

257
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,320
is our storage this is long-term

258
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,640
memory for computers okay so we install

259
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,120
the data in the database to persistent

260
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,360
we say it's the persistent data you have

261
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,800
to store them in computer okay okay so

262
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,959
let's see for today what have you

263
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,720
learned today database database so

264
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,880
what's database

265
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,000
it's where you hold data we will hold

266
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,200
data but

267
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,320
more

268
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,880
precisely you know we can hold data here

269
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,519
and there in different storage but

270
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,200
database is that we store the data in an

271
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,120
organized way okay why don't i use it

272
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,200
i don't know we store the data in an

273
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,800
organized way so we can

274
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,680
store retrieve manage the data easily

275
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
more conveniently am right yeah

276
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,640
okay

277
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,839
what have you learned ryan has answers

278
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,839
everything uh what have you done

279
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,839
we can store the data here but what's

280
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,839
database

281
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,509
[Music]

282
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,839
yeah yeah it's a place you see so we

283
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,200
store the data in an organized way so we

284
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,399
can retrieve it store it and manage the

285
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,240
data

286
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,760
electronically okay yes

287
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,760
sorry how do you put this put it in the

288
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,880
computer look at that's a big pc box

289
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,640
okay

290
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,800
okay maybe i'll show you later okay

291
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,800
that's it for today bye bye

292
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
bye
