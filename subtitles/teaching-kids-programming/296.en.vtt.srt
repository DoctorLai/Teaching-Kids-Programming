1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,350

hello

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:01,360
hello
 

3
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,150
hello
hello mr mr rhino are you right

4
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,160
hello mr mr rhino are you right
 

5
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,670
hello mr mr rhino are you right
yeah uh remember

6
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,680
yeah uh remember
 

7
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,990
yeah uh remember
what we have talked about is quadratic

8
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,000
what we have talked about is quadratic
 

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,669
what we have talked about is quadratic
equation yeah conjecture what's

10
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
equation yeah conjecture what's
 

11
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,509
equation yeah conjecture what's
conjugated

12
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
conjugated
 

13
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,150
conjugated
quadratic equation

14
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
quadratic equation
 

15
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,230
quadratic equation
what's conjecturing mean it's this um

16
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
what's conjecturing mean it's this um
 

17
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,230
what's conjecturing mean it's this um
what what's called you you say it's

18
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
what what's called you you say it's
 

19
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,070
what what's called you you say it's
false but it's not for

20
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
false but it's not for
 

21
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,750
false but it's not for
quadratic

22
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
quadratic
 

23
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,630
quadratic
so

24
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
so
 

25
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,070
so
is this a symmetric thing yeah yeah x

26
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
is this a symmetric thing yeah yeah x
 

27
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,470
is this a symmetric thing yeah yeah x
squared plus b x plus c equals zero

28
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
squared plus b x plus c equals zero
 

29
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,790
squared plus b x plus c equals zero
right this is conjugated because we only

30
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
right this is conjugated because we only
 

31
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,350
right this is conjugated because we only
have one unknown which is x

32
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
have one unknown which is x
 

33
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,910
have one unknown which is x
okay unknown this x is unknown we want

34
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
okay unknown this x is unknown we want
 

35
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,950
okay unknown this x is unknown we want
to solve it

36
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
to solve it
 

37
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,389
to solve it
a b c are constant where a is not equal

38
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
a b c are constant where a is not equal
 

39
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,910
a b c are constant where a is not equal
to zero if a is equal to zero then this

40
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
to zero if a is equal to zero then this
 

41
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,069
to zero if a is equal to zero then this
whole thing is gone it's b x plus c is

42
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
whole thing is gone it's b x plus c is
 

43
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,029
whole thing is gone it's b x plus c is
not quadratic okay make sense but b x

44
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
not quadratic okay make sense but b x
 

45
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,150
not quadratic okay make sense but b x
plus c

46
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
plus c
 

47
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,950
plus c
equals zero that's a line

48
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
equals zero that's a line
 

49
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,549
equals zero that's a line
that's a line

50
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
that's a line
 

51
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,869
that's a line
line okay if you draw these please

52
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
line okay if you draw these please
 

53
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,630
line okay if you draw these please
remember parabola yeah parabola yeah

54
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
remember parabola yeah parabola yeah
 

55
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,189
remember parabola yeah parabola yeah
but then the graph you look like

56
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
but then the graph you look like
 

57
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,870
but then the graph you look like
yeah these are yeah pollution yeah yeah

58
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
yeah these are yeah pollution yeah yeah
 

59
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,190
yeah these are yeah pollution yeah yeah
don't get out going down if a is

60
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
don't get out going down if a is
 

61
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,230
don't get out going down if a is
positive it is going up and it's

62
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
positive it is going up and it's
 

63
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,830
positive it is going up and it's
negative

64
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
negative
 

65
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,429
negative
going down all right

66
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
going down all right
 

67
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,950
going down all right
okay so

68
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
okay so
 

69
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,510
okay so
yeah that's fine okay so now we talk uh

70
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
yeah that's fine okay so now we talk uh
 

71
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,350
yeah that's fine okay so now we talk uh
today we're going to solve this problem

72
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
today we're going to solve this problem
 

73
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,749
today we're going to solve this problem
we're going to find the roots

74
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
we're going to find the roots
 

75
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,550
we're going to find the roots
the roots okay

76
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
the roots okay
 

77
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,630
the roots okay
to this equation

78
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
to this equation
 

79
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,350
to this equation
given is a b c if they are any right

80
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
given is a b c if they are any right
 

81
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,870
given is a b c if they are any right
sometimes they don't uh we don't have

82
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
sometimes they don't uh we don't have
 

83
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,230
sometimes they don't uh we don't have
any uh

84
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
any uh
 

85
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,069
any uh
sometimes this causative equation does

86
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
sometimes this causative equation does
 

87
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,230
sometimes this causative equation does
not have any roots right or you could

88
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
not have any roots right or you could
 

89
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,270
not have any roots right or you could
have a

90
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
have a
 

91
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,710
have a
you know

92
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
you know
 

93
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,670
you know
imaginary which is not real okay

94
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
imaginary which is not real okay
 

95
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,310
imaginary which is not real okay
so these are roots

96
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
so these are roots
 

97
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,469
so these are roots
so first of all look

98
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
so first of all look
 

99
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,030
so first of all look
so first of all can you tell me a times

100
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
so first of all can you tell me a times
 

101
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,109
so first of all can you tell me a times
b plus c

102
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
b plus c
 

103
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,910
b plus c
can we write it as what

104
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
can we write it as what
 

105
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,230
can we write it as what
what is the equal

106
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
what is the equal
 

107
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,670
what is the equal
the the addition rule remember

108
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
the the addition rule remember
 

109
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,550
the the addition rule remember
a times b plus a times c right doesn't

110
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
a times b plus a times c right doesn't
 

111
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,389
a times b plus a times c right doesn't
make sense yeah

112
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
make sense yeah
 

113
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,390
make sense yeah
yeah this is this is single right let

114
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
yeah this is this is single right let
 

115
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,710
yeah this is this is single right let
that give you an example 10 times

116
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
that give you an example 10 times
 

117
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,910
that give you an example 10 times
20 plus 5 what does it equal

118
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920

 

119
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,630

come on give me an answer a thousand

120
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
come on give me an answer a thousand
 

121
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,670
come on give me an answer a thousand
huh

122
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
huh
 

123
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,869
huh
ten times twenty plus five

124
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
ten times twenty plus five
 

125
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,350
ten times twenty plus five
i mean uh two hundred fifty two hundred

126
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
i mean uh two hundred fifty two hundred
 

127
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,030
i mean uh two hundred fifty two hundred
fifty yeah so what does z equal it

128
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
fifty yeah so what does z equal it
 

129
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,110
fifty yeah so what does z equal it
equals ten times twenty

130
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
equals ten times twenty
 

131
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,270
equals ten times twenty
plus you know you see ten times twenty

132
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
plus you know you see ten times twenty
 

133
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,869
plus you know you see ten times twenty
plus 10 times 5 right this is 200 and

134
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
plus 10 times 5 right this is 200 and
 

135
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,309
plus 10 times 5 right this is 200 and
this is 50. and if it's if it's negative

136
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
this is 50. and if it's if it's negative
 

137
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,150
this is 50. and if it's if it's negative
it's the same right if it's minus you

138
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
it's the same right if it's minus you
 

139
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,470
it's the same right if it's minus you
can change the minus right correct this

140
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
can change the minus right correct this
 

141
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,030
can change the minus right correct this
is called additional right okay so you

142
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
is called additional right okay so you
 

143
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,750
is called additional right okay so you
we know this and how about this

144
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
we know this and how about this
 

145
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,229
we know this and how about this
a plus b

146
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
a plus b
 

147
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,150
a plus b
times c plus b

148
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
times c plus b
 

149
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,070
times c plus b
so how can we write this

150
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
so how can we write this
 

151
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,309
so how can we write this
how can we write this

152
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
how can we write this
 

153
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,070
how can we write this
eh

154
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080

 

155
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,670

so the exchange rule will be something

156
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
so the exchange rule will be something
 

157
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,509
so the exchange rule will be something
like look look you can

158
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
like look look you can
 

159
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,229
like look look you can
take this whole thing as one one term

160
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
take this whole thing as one one term
 

161
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,830
take this whole thing as one one term
okay

162
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
okay
 

163
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,509
okay
take this whole whole thing as one term

164
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
take this whole whole thing as one term
 

165
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,790
take this whole whole thing as one term
right so you'll be

166
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
right so you'll be
 

167
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,790
right so you'll be
a plus b

168
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
a plus b
 

169

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,470
a plus b
times t right yeah this whole thing is a

176
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
times t right yeah this whole thing is a
 

177
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,309
times t right yeah this whole thing is a
term right right right you're looking at

178
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
term right right right you're looking at
 

179
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,670
term right right right you're looking at
right

180
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
right
 

181
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,830
right
okay and now if we keep expanding this

182
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
okay and now if we keep expanding this
 

183
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,990
okay and now if we keep expanding this
right like this it will be ac plus bc

184
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
right like this it will be ac plus bc
 

185
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,710
right like this it will be ac plus bc
plus a d yeah

186
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
plus a d yeah
 

187
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,910
plus a d yeah
a d plus b d right yeah

188
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
a d plus b d right yeah
 

189
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,949
a d plus b d right yeah
okay

190
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
okay
 

191
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,309
okay
and then look

192
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
and then look
 

193
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,190
and then look
if we

194
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
if we
 

195
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,589
if we
look this is the if we can join this

196
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
look this is the if we can join this
 

197
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,309
look this is the if we can join this
right we're going to join this will be a

198
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
right we're going to join this will be a
 

199
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,110
right we're going to join this will be a
c plus d

200
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
c plus d
 

201
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,550
c plus d
plus one b

202
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
plus one b
 

203
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,830
plus one b
c plus d we join these two terms right

204
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
c plus d we join these two terms right
 

205
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,750
c plus d we join these two terms right
okay and then look this is common terms

206
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
okay and then look this is common terms
 

207
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,589
okay and then look this is common terms
like c plus d and then times a plus b

208
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
like c plus d and then times a plus b
 

209
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,750
like c plus d and then times a plus b
okay it's the same it's the same yeah so

210
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
okay it's the same it's the same yeah so
 

211
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,350
okay it's the same it's the same yeah so
the point i'm doing here is i want to

212
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
the point i'm doing here is i want to
 

213
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,869
the point i'm doing here is i want to
prove that this

214
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
prove that this
 

215
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,229
prove that this
this uh additional rule right so you can

216
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
this uh additional rule right so you can
 

217
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,350
this uh additional rule right so you can
take this

218
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
take this
 

219
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,710
take this
so how look

220
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
so how look
 

221
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,470
so how look
if

222
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
if
 

223
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,069
if
if

224
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
if
 

225
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,629
if
if it's the same a plus b

226
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
if it's the same a plus b
 

227
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,150
if it's the same a plus b
square

228
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
square
 

229
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,629
square
square right so it's actually

230
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
square right so it's actually
 

231
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,870
square right so it's actually
what a plus b

232
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
what a plus b
 

233
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,230
what a plus b
if a plus b times a plus b

234
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
if a plus b times a plus b
 

235
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,909
if a plus b times a plus b
yeah

236
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
yeah
 

237
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,430
yeah
a plus b times

238
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
a plus b times
 

239
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,390
a plus b times
a plus b so a is actually a plus b

240
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
a plus b so a is actually a plus b
 

241
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,510
a plus b so a is actually a plus b
a plus b squared what does it equal

242
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
a plus b squared what does it equal
 

243
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,590
a plus b squared what does it equal
right we can do this whole thing take

244
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
right we can do this whole thing take
 

245
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,150
right we can do this whole thing take
this so a plus b times a right

246
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
this so a plus b times a right
 

247
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,110
this so a plus b times a right
yeah

248
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
yeah
 

249
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,629
yeah
and plus

250
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
and plus
 

251
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,749
and plus
plus one

252
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
plus one
 

253
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,710
plus one
a plus b times r

254
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
a plus b times r
 

255
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,189
a plus b times r
times b right and this thing you know

256
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
times b right and this thing you know
 

257
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,629
times b right and this thing you know
right it's a

258
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
right it's a
 

259
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,550
right it's a
a square plus

260
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
a square plus
 

261
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,670
a square plus
a b

262
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
a b
 

263
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,030
a b
plus

264
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
plus
 

265
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,909
plus
a b

266
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
a b
 

267
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,270
a b
plus

268
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
plus
 

269
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,990
plus
b square okay so what do we have

270
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
b square okay so what do we have
 

271
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,350
b square okay so what do we have
a a square plus two times a b

272
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
a a square plus two times a b
 

273
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,270
a a square plus two times a b
plus b squared okay

274
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
plus b squared okay
 

275
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,550
plus b squared okay
so this is very important okay a

276
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
so this is very important okay a
 

277
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,749
so this is very important okay a
a plus b square equals

278
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
a plus b square equals
 

279
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,029
a plus b square equals
a squared plus b squared plus two times

280
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
a squared plus b squared plus two times
 

281
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,230
a squared plus b squared plus two times
a b okay

282
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240

 

283
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,749

yeah

284
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
yeah
 

285
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,830
yeah
make sense

286
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
make sense
 

287
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,870
make sense
okay ryan are you all right

288
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
okay ryan are you all right
 

289
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,790
okay ryan are you all right
a squared plus b squared plus two a b

290
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
a squared plus b squared plus two a b
 

291
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,790
a squared plus b squared plus two a b
okay

292
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
okay
 

293
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,230
okay
now

294
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
now
 

295
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,270
now
now we have no at least okay so let's

296
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
now we have no at least okay so let's
 

297
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,790
now we have no at least okay so let's
let's do this look

298
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
let's do this look
 

299
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,150
let's do this look
a square plus b x plus c equals zero and

300
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
a square plus b x plus c equals zero and
 

301
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,830
a square plus b x plus c equals zero and
how about if i move the c to the right

302
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
how about if i move the c to the right
 

303
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,830
how about if i move the c to the right
hand side so what is z equal if i move

304
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
hand side so what is z equal if i move
 

305
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,629
hand side so what is z equal if i move
the plastic plus term on the other side

306
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
the plastic plus term on the other side
 

307
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,390
the plastic plus term on the other side
of equation we need to do a we need to

308
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
of equation we need to do a we need to
 

309
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,189
of equation we need to do a we need to
change the sign right alright

310
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
change the sign right alright
 

311
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,189
change the sign right alright
so what does the ego

312
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
so what does the ego
 

313
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,590
so what does the ego
so a x square plus b x equals minus c

314
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
so a x square plus b x equals minus c
 

315
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,270
so a x square plus b x equals minus c
okay

316
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
okay
 

317
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,070
okay
yeah

318
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
yeah
 

319
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,550
yeah
yeah it simply move the constant

320
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
yeah it simply move the constant
 

321
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,469
yeah it simply move the constant
to the right hand side

322
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
to the right hand side
 

323
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,150
to the right hand side
and this means we need to give it a

324
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
and this means we need to give it a
 

325
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,029
and this means we need to give it a
negative to neglect

326
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
negative to neglect
 

327
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,590
negative to neglect
neglect negat we get

328
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
neglect negat we get
 

329
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,150
neglect negat we get
we get the the number

330
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
we get the the number
 

331
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,830
we get the the number
okay and how about if i times

332
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
okay and how about if i times
 

333
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,990
okay and how about if i times
4a

334
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
4a
 

335
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,230
4a
yeah for a to both sides yeah because

336
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
yeah for a to both sides yeah because
 

337
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,390
yeah for a to both sides yeah because
they have two left they are the same so

338
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
they have two left they are the same so
 

339
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,309
they have two left they are the same so
if i multiply both

340
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
if i multiply both
 

341
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,110
if i multiply both
both sides for a 4 times a

342
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
both sides for a 4 times a
 

343
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,070
both sides for a 4 times a
4 times a okay so what does it go

344
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
4 times a okay so what does it go
 

345
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,550
4 times a okay so what does it go
4 a squared

346
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
4 a squared
 

347
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,790
4 a squared
x square

348
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
x square
 

349
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,150
x square
plus 4 a b x

350
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
plus 4 a b x
 

351
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,830
plus 4 a b x
equals minus 4 a c

352
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
equals minus 4 a c
 

353
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,990
equals minus 4 a c
yeah from here

354
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
yeah from here
 

355
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,510
yeah from here
to here

356
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
to here
 

357
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,430
to here
we multiply both sides for a

358
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
we multiply both sides for a
 

359
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,870
we multiply both sides for a
right

360
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
right
 

361
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,550
right
a is not equal to zero right we know

362
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
a is not equal to zero right we know
 

363
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,350
a is not equal to zero right we know
that

364
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
that
 

365
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,390
that
and now

366
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
and now
 

367
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,510
and now
next step is okay now we do this four

368
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
next step is okay now we do this four
 

369
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,909
next step is okay now we do this four
times five and then here we are i want

370
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
times five and then here we are i want
 

371
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,029
times five and then here we are i want
to add a

372
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
to add a
 

373
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,749
to add a
b square to to both sides right if both

374
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
b square to to both sides right if both
 

375
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,909
b square to to both sides right if both
terms are equal

376
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
terms are equal
 

377
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,510
terms are equal
if the values expressions be uh you know

378
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
if the values expressions be uh you know
 

379
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,589
if the values expressions be uh you know
on both sides of the

380
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
on both sides of the
 

381
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,629
on both sides of the
equation

382
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
equation
 

383
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,390
equation
we can add the same similar terms the

384
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
we can add the same similar terms the
 

385
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,390
we can add the same similar terms the
same thing right so we add b squared so

386
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
same thing right so we add b squared so
 

387
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,629
same thing right so we add b squared so
it's 4a squared

388
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
it's 4a squared
 

389
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,670
it's 4a squared
x squared plus 4 a b

yeah yeah we know that yeah i just

424
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
yeah yeah we know that yeah i just
 

425
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,230
yeah yeah we know that yeah i just
showed you before right and so

426
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
showed you before right and so
 

427
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,629
showed you before right and so
we can do we can check if this equals

428
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
we can do we can check if this equals
 

429
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,390
we can do we can check if this equals
yeah

430
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
yeah
 

431
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,189
yeah
this thing squared is 4a squared x

432
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:17,199
this thing squared is 4a squared x
 

433
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,150
this thing squared is 4a squared x
squared

434
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
squared
 

435
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,629
squared
this thing squared is b squared yeah so

436
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
this thing squared is b squared yeah so
 

437
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,270
this thing squared is b squared yeah so
we have these two terms here and 2

438
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
we have these two terms here and 2
 

439
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,070
we have these two terms here and 2
2 times a b so if i times these times c

440
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
2 times a b so if i times these times c
 

441
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,629
2 times a b so if i times these times c
times two is two a x

442
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
times two is two a x
 

443
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,430
times two is two a x
b

444
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
b
 

445
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,550
b
times two is four a x b x right four a b

446
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
times two is four a x b x right four a b
 

447
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,870
times two is four a x b x right four a b
x yeah exactly so look

448
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
x yeah exactly so look
 

449
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,670
x yeah exactly so look
yeah

450
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680

 

451
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,589

so look two a

452
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
so look two a
 

453
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,469
so look two a
plus b squared equals b squared minus

454
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
plus b squared equals b squared minus
 

455
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,710
plus b squared equals b squared minus
4ac

456
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
4ac
 

457
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,509
4ac
okay if if we square root of both both

458
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
okay if if we square root of both both
 

459
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,710
okay if if we square root of both both
sides

460
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
sides
 

461
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,230
sides
yeah if we square root both sides

462
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
yeah if we square root both sides
 

463
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,710
yeah if we square root both sides
right so we need to

464
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
right so we need to
 

465
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,750
right so we need to
put a

466
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
put a
 

467
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,590
put a
plus minus because it has two rules

468
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
plus minus because it has two rules
 

469
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,269
plus minus because it has two rules
right so look

470
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
right so look
 

471
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,269
right so look
x square equals 16 what's x

472
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
x square equals 16 what's x
 

473
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,870
x square equals 16 what's x
uh four

474
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
uh four
 

475
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,350
uh four
four and another another root is minus

476
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
four and another another root is minus
 

477
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,870
four and another another root is minus
four remember

478
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
four remember
 

479
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,509
four remember
yeah four times square four square is

480
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
yeah four times square four square is
 

481
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,070
yeah four times square four square is
sixteen minus four square is also

482
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
sixteen minus four square is also
 

483
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,949
sixteen minus four square is also
sixteen because minus one times minus

484
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
sixteen because minus one times minus
 

485
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,750
sixteen because minus one times minus
one

486
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
one
 

487
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,389
one
double negative makes positive right so

488
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
double negative makes positive right so
 

489
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,550
double negative makes positive right so
that's another so if we square root of

490
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
that's another so if we square root of
 

491
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,509
that's another so if we square root of
this

492
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
this
 

493
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,190
this
so 2a x plus b square root 3

494
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
so 2a x plus b square root 3
 

495
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,230
so 2a x plus b square root 3
b squared minus 4ac and we need to put

496
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
b squared minus 4ac and we need to put
 

497
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,230
b squared minus 4ac and we need to put
the plus minus sign yeah right that's

498
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
the plus minus sign yeah right that's
 

499
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,430
the plus minus sign yeah right that's
what it means

500
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
what it means
 

501
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,710
what it means
and now

502
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
and now
 

503
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,630
and now
this is easy we want to find the value

504
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
this is easy we want to find the value
 

505
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,630
this is easy we want to find the value
of x

506
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640

 

507
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,910

by the way you don't need to remember

508
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
by the way you don't need to remember
 

509
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,070
by the way you don't need to remember
all these i'm just showing how showing

510
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
all these i'm just showing how showing
 

511
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,710
all these i'm just showing how showing
you how we get the final equation right

512
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
you how we get the final equation right
 

513
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,829
you how we get the final equation right
yeah

514
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
yeah
 

515
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,710
yeah
okay now look so 2a x plus b equals that

516
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
okay now look so 2a x plus b equals that
 

517
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,110
okay now look so 2a x plus b equals that
then b x equals 1

518
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
then b x equals 1
 

519
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,030
then b x equals 1
x equals

520
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
x equals
 

521
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,590
x equals
minus 2a right minus 2a

522
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600

 

523
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,550

uh

524
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
uh
 

525
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,150
uh
uh no 2a

526
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
uh no 2a
 

527
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,590
uh no 2a
if you uh

528
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
if you uh
 

529
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,949
if you uh
actually

530
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
actually
 

531
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,430
actually
let's do it one by one okay so it's

532
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
let's do it one by one okay so it's
 

533
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,630
let's do it one by one okay so it's
confused

534
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
confused
 

535
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,269
confused
minus b to the other side so

536
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
minus b to the other side so
 

537
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,630
minus b to the other side so
b squared minus four ac

538
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640

plus equal minus minus b
 

543
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,949
plus equal minus minus b
divided by 2a okay

544
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
divided by 2a okay
 

545
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,190
divided by 2a okay
okay so this x is equally

546
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
okay so this x is equally
 

547
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,350
okay so this x is equally

00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519

 

587
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,110

what's the value of a in this case

588
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
what's the value of a in this case
 

589
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,550
what's the value of a in this case
what's abc

590
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
what's abc
 

591
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,310
what's abc
a is

592
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
a is
 

593
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,190
a is
what's the term before that

594
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
what's the term before that
 

595
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,829
what's the term before that
one one what's the b

596
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
one one what's the b
 

597
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,110

coefficient
 

599
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,509
coefficient
b what's the term before the one you

600
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
b what's the term before the one you
 

601
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,150
b what's the term before the one you
know linear

602
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160

 

603
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,310

what's the value before x

604
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
what's the value before x
 

605
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,990
what's the value before x
what's the value because

606
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
what's the value because
 

607
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,590
what's the value because
two what's the value of c

608
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
two what's the value of c
 

609
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,430

what's the constant term which one

610
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
what's the constant term which one
 

611
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,470
what's the constant term which one
constant one yeah okay so what's the

612
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
constant one yeah okay so what's the
 

613
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,590
constant one yeah okay so what's the
rule of it x equals left so x equals one

614
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
rule of it x equals left so x equals one
 

615
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,990
rule of it x equals left so x equals one
two times a two times one

616
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
two times a two times one
 

617
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,550
two times a two times one
minus b is minus two

618
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
minus b is minus two
 

619
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,710
minus b is minus two
plus minus

620
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
plus minus
 

621
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,990
plus minus
b squared

622
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
b squared
 

623
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,269
b squared
four

624
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
four
 

625
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,550
four
minus four times a with one

626
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
minus four times a with one
 

627
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,750
minus four times a with one
yeah okay

628
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
yeah okay
 

629
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,310
yeah okay
so what's this number four minus over

630
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
so what's this number four minus over
 

631
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,509
so what's this number four minus over
zero

632
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
zero
 

633
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,550
zero
square root of zero

634
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
square root of zero
 

635
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,389
square root of zero
zero

636
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399

637
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,670
zero
two

638
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
two
 

639
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,030
two
minus two

640
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
minus two
 

641
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,269
minus two
divided by two

642
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
divided by two
 

643
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,230
divided by two
minus one right so the root is minus one

644
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
minus one right so the root is minus one
 

645
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,590
minus one right so the root is minus one
there's only one root why is that

646
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
there's only one root why is that
 

647
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,150
there's only one root why is that
because plus minus there are two h

648
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
because plus minus there are two h
 

649
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,590
because plus minus there are two h
actually two roots but they are still

650
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
actually two roots but they are still
 

651
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,590
actually two roots but they are still
the same so it's all

652
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
the same so it's all
 

653
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,269
the same so it's all
it's both minus one

654
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
it's both minus one
 

655
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,110
it's both minus one
okay let's put it back

656
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
okay let's put it back
 

657
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,470
okay let's put it back
minus one

658
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480

yeah you see we find a little is it yeah

680
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
yeah you see we find a little is it yeah
 

681
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,790
yeah you see we find a little is it yeah
okay so what why is that look um

682
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
okay so what why is that look um
 

683
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,069
okay so what why is that look um
why is that

684
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
why is that
 

685
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,870
why is that
because look at x this x

686
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
because look at x this x
 

687
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,389
because look at x this x
it can be written as x minus 1 square

688
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
it can be written as x minus 1 square
 

689
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,870
it can be written as x minus 1 square
or x plus one square equals zero right

690
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
or x plus one square equals zero right
 

691
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,910
or x plus one square equals zero right
yeah remember we go we know

692
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
yeah remember we go we know
 

693
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,910
yeah remember we go we know
a plus b square

694
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
a plus b square
 

695
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,030
a plus b square
equals a squared plus two a b plus b

696
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
equals a squared plus two a b plus b
 

697
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,269
equals a squared plus two a b plus b
squared right yeah we already know that

698
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
squared right yeah we already know that
 

699
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,430
squared right yeah we already know that
this is very important here

700
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
this is very important here
 

701
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,069
this is very important here
now look let's verify if this is x

702
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
now look let's verify if this is x
 

703
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,430
now look let's verify if this is x
square

704
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
square
 

705
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,269
square
plus a square

706
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
plus a square
 

707
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,949
plus a square
plus b square

708
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
plus b square
 

709
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,949
plus b square
plus two times of

710
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
plus two times of
 

711
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,750
plus two times of
these terms together yeah you see

712
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
these terms together yeah you see
 

713
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,949
these terms together yeah you see
so look

714
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
so look
 

715
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,150
so look
x plus one square equals zero what's the

716
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
x plus one square equals zero what's the
 

717
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,150
x plus one square equals zero what's the
value of x

718
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
value of x
 

719
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,350
value of x
what's the value of x x plus one

720
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
what's the value of x x plus one
 

721
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,829
what's the value of x x plus one
squared equals zero what's the value of

722
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839

 

723
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,829

x you take the square root so what's

724
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
x you take the square root so what's
 

725
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,150
x you take the square root so what's
this

726
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160

 

727
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,870

this is zero so what's x zero

728
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
this is zero so what's x zero
 

729
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,670
this is zero so what's x zero
x plus one equals zero minus one yeah

730
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
x plus one equals zero minus one yeah
 

731
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,870
x plus one equals zero minus one yeah
you see yeah okay okay another example

732
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
you see yeah okay okay another example
 

733
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,670
you see yeah okay okay another example
another example okay

734
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
another example okay
 

735
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,269
another example okay
x minus three times x minus x plus four

736
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:07,279
x minus three times x minus x plus four
 

737
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,629
x minus three times x minus x plus four
equals zero

738
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
equals zero
 

739
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,030
equals zero
what's the what's the possible value of

740
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
what's the what's the possible value of
 

741
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,189
what's the what's the possible value of
x some of this is easy

742
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
x some of this is easy
 

743
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,629
x some of this is easy
x minus three

744
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
x minus three
 

745
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,470
x minus three
times x plus 4 equals 0. if two numbers

746
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
times x plus 4 equals 0. if two numbers
 

747
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,389
times x plus 4 equals 0. if two numbers
multiply to 0

748
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
multiply to 0
 

749
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,949
multiply to 0
what does it mean

750
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:22,959
what does it mean
 

751
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,990
what does it mean
one of them is zero right yeah so either

752
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
one of them is zero right yeah so either
 

753
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,150
one of them is zero right yeah so either
this is zero all this is zero right so

754
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
this is zero all this is zero right so
 

755
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,949
this is zero all this is zero right so
if x is three

756
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
if x is three
 

757
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,069
if x is three
this is zero if x equals minus four

758
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079

 

759
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,310

this is zero so there are two roots yeah

760
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
this is zero so there are two roots yeah
 

761
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,670
this is zero so there are two roots yeah
that's two roots

762
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
that's two roots
 

763
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,389
that's two roots
right look this is true this is easy but

764
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
right look this is true this is easy but
 

765
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,030
right look this is true this is easy but
if we convert it to less tender ax

766
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
if we convert it to less tender ax
 

767
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,750
if we convert it to less tender ax
square plus bx plus c equals zero look

768
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
square plus bx plus c equals zero look
 

769
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,829
square plus bx plus c equals zero look
what's this

770
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
what's this
 

771
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,069
what's this
x square plus

772
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
x square plus
 

773
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,430
x square plus
four x

774
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
four x
 

775
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,110
four x
minus three x

776
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
minus three x
 

777
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,030
minus three x
minus 12 equals zero all right right x

778
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
minus 12 equals zero all right right x
 

779
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,990
minus 12 equals zero all right right x
square

780
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
square
 

781
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,590
square
plus x minus 12 equals zero

782
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
plus x minus 12 equals zero
 

783
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,910
plus x minus 12 equals zero
okay so look this is a a is one

784
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
okay so look this is a a is one
 

785
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,069
okay so look this is a a is one
b is one

786
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
b is one
 

787
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,590
b is one
c is minus 12 right

788
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
c is minus 12 right
 

789
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,870
c is minus 12 right
yeah

790
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
yeah
 

791
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,389
yeah
okay so if we

792
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:16,399
okay so if we
 

793
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,790
okay so if we
let's verify that to see if it's correct

794
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
let's verify that to see if it's correct
 

795
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,750
let's verify that to see if it's correct
okay

796
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
okay
 

797
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,030
okay
uh

798
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,040
uh
 

799
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,910
uh
[Music]

800
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
[Music]
 

801
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,310
[Music]
let's just double check x square plus 4x

802
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
let's just double check x square plus 4x
 

803
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,949
let's just double check x square plus 4x
minus 3x

804
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
minus 3x
 

805
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,470
minus 3x
minus 12 yeah

806
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
minus 12 yeah
 

807
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,110
minus 12 yeah
so look 2 times a 2

808
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
so look 2 times a 2
 

809
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,949
so look 2 times a 2
minus b

810
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
minus b
 

811
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,829
minus b
plus minus

812
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
plus minus
 

813
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,629
plus minus
b squared

814
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639

 

815
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,069

plus 4 times 12 so 48

816
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
plus 4 times 12 so 48
 

817
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,350
plus 4 times 12 so 48
yeah

818
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
yeah
 

819
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,230
yeah
4 48 plus 1 49 what's the square root of

820
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
4 48 plus 1 49 what's the square root of
 

821
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,350
4 48 plus 1 49 what's the square root of
49 um seven yeah so seven this whole

822
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
49 um seven yeah so seven this whole
 

823
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,430
49 um seven yeah so seven this whole
thing is seven so there are two roots

824
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
thing is seven so there are two roots
 

825
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,069
thing is seven so there are two roots
minus one plus seven divided by two or

826
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
minus one plus seven divided by two or
 

827
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,030
minus one plus seven divided by two or
minus one minus seven divided by two

828
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,040
minus one minus seven divided by two
 

829
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,110
minus one minus seven divided by two
when it's plus that's three

830
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
when it's plus that's three
 

831
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,230
when it's plus that's three
what is minus is minus four right

832
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
what is minus is minus four right
 

833
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,550
what is minus is minus four right
yeah you see

834
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
yeah you see
 

835
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,470
yeah you see
yeah you see it's the same yeah you see

836
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
yeah you see it's the same yeah you see
 

837
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,389
yeah you see it's the same yeah you see
it's the same okay

838
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
it's the same okay
 

839
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,629
it's the same okay
okay so why is this useful okay why is

840
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
okay so why is this useful okay why is
 

841
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,150
okay so why is this useful okay why is
this reason

842
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160

 

843
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,430

okay so sir

844
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
okay so sir
 

845
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,910
okay so sir
sometimes it doesn't have a load for

846
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
sometimes it doesn't have a load for
 

847
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,790
sometimes it doesn't have a load for
example

848
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
example
 

849
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,710
example
if you write if you plot this in the

850
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
if you write if you plot this in the
 

851
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,910
if you write if you plot this in the
graph x and y right right

852
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
graph x and y right right
 

853
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,629
graph x and y right right
if you if the graph is like that

854
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
if you if the graph is like that
 

855
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,990
if you if the graph is like that
there's two roots

856
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
there's two roots
 

857
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,590
there's two roots
yeah when y is you know there's two

858
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
yeah when y is you know there's two
 

859
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,990
yeah when y is you know there's two
roots right yeah two roots

860
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
roots right yeah two roots
 

861
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,389
roots right yeah two roots
yeah all right but you forgot it's like

862
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:36,399
yeah all right but you forgot it's like
 

863
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,629
yeah all right but you forgot it's like
that doesn't have a root

864
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
that doesn't have a root
 

865
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,310
that doesn't have a root
it doesn't have any connection back to

866
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
it doesn't have any connection back to
 

867
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,110
it doesn't have any connection back to
the actual axis right but how about this

868
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
the actual axis right but how about this
 

869
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,949
the actual axis right but how about this
does it have a root

870
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
does it have a root
 

871
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,629
does it have a root
yeah you have two roots you have two

872
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
yeah you have two roots you have two
 

873
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,350
yeah you have two roots you have two
roots okay so when it doesn't when look

874
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
roots okay so when it doesn't when look
 

875
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,430
roots okay so when it doesn't when look
because we have a term b square minus

876
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
because we have a term b square minus
 

877
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,509
because we have a term b square minus
four ac

878
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
four ac
 

879
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,430
four ac
if it it only has it only has

880
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
if it it only has it only has
 

881
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,389
if it it only has it only has
roots okay we call it roots real roots

882
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
roots okay we call it roots real roots
 

883
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,629
roots okay we call it roots real roots
real roots

884
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:02,639
real roots
 

885
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,309
real roots
real roots if and only if b square minus

886
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
real roots if and only if b square minus
 

887
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,110
real roots if and only if b square minus
4ac is bigger or equal than zero right

888
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
4ac is bigger or equal than zero right
 

889
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,870
4ac is bigger or equal than zero right
can you tell me what's the minus

890
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
can you tell me what's the minus
 

891
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,990
can you tell me what's the minus
negative

892
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
negative
 

893
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,069
negative
16 square root right there's no real

894
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
16 square root right there's no real
 

895
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,110
16 square root right there's no real
rules

896
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
rules
 

897
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,669
rules
to get it right yeah

898
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
to get it right yeah
 

899
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,470
to get it right yeah
yeah

900
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
yeah
 

901
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,990
yeah
but we have look

902
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
but we have look
 

903
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,029
but we have look
these things square root the real roots

904
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
these things square root the real roots
 

905
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,949
these things square root the real roots
for the square root

906
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
for the square root
 

907
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,429
for the square root
right it needs to this term inside is

908
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
right it needs to this term inside is
 

909
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,590
right it needs to this term inside is
going to be bigger or equal than zero

910
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
going to be bigger or equal than zero
 

911
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,110
going to be bigger or equal than zero
right that's what it means so when we

912
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
right that's what it means so when we
 

913
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,230
right that's what it means so when we
think b square minus 4ac

914
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
think b square minus 4ac
 

915
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,750
think b square minus 4ac
is bigger or equal than zero then this

916
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
is bigger or equal than zero then this
 

917
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,390
is bigger or equal than zero then this
this term parallel

918
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400
this term parallel
 

919
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,230
this term parallel
here yes parallel bar

920
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
here yes parallel bar
 

921
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,430
here yes parallel bar
has

922
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
has
 

923
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,830
has
tested what

924
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:45,840
tested what
 

925
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,070
tested what
intercess with the x-axis we can find

926
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
intercess with the x-axis we can find
 

927
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,230
intercess with the x-axis we can find
the roots right either one or two

928
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
the roots right either one or two
 

929
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,430
the roots right either one or two
two roots yeah

930
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
two roots yeah
 

931
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,630
two roots yeah
okay

932
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:52,640
okay
 

933
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,590
okay
am i right

934
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
am i right
 

935
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,950
am i right
look why y equals x square here

936
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
look why y equals x square here
 

937
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,990
look why y equals x square here
the node is yeah connection zero

938
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,000

 

939
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,710

x squared plus one equals zero

940
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:04,720
x squared plus one equals zero
 

941
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,270
x squared plus one equals zero
what's x squared plus y zero

942
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
what's x squared plus y zero
 

943
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,950
what's x squared plus y zero
is here

944
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
is here
 

945
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,110
is here
it doesn't have connection with x axis

946
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,120
it doesn't have connection with x axis
 

947
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,270
it doesn't have connection with x axis
right so it doesn't have any rows but

948
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280

 

949
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,510

how about this one what's this it's

950
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
how about this one what's this it's
 

951
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,270
how about this one what's this it's
minus x square

952
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
minus x square
 

953
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,029
minus x square
plus one

954
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
plus one
 

955
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,990
plus one
is this when x is zero y is one one

956
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
is this when x is zero y is one one
 

957
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,950
is this when x is zero y is one one
right

958
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
right
 

959
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,350
right
so look it has two loads right

960
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
so look it has two loads right
 

961
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,190
so look it has two loads right
yes to lose right okay because when a is

962
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200

 

963
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,310

when a

964
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,320
when a
 

965
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,870
when a
is negative this this whole thing is

966
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
is negative this this whole thing is
 

967
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,950
is negative this this whole thing is
facing down right this whole thing is

968
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:40,960
facing down right this whole thing is
 

969
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,230
facing down right this whole thing is
facing down

970
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
facing down
 

971
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,350
facing down
so when x is yellow it's one

972
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
so when x is yellow it's one
 

973
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,150
so when x is yellow it's one
so

974
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
so
 

975
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,750
so
it's facing down right so you have two

976
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
it's facing down right so you have two
 

977
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,350
it's facing down right so you have two
loops right okay so now today easy

978
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
loops right okay so now today easy
 

979
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,230
loops right okay so now today easy
given uh the final thing final thing

980
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
given uh the final thing final thing
 

981
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,590
given uh the final thing final thing
before i forget

982
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
before i forget
 

983
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,190
before i forget
given this ax square plus bx plus c

984
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
given this ax square plus bx plus c
 

985
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,590
given this ax square plus bx plus c
equals zero right and we want to find

986
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
equals zero right and we want to find
 

987
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,710
equals zero right and we want to find
the real root so define

988
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
the real root so define
 

989
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,669
the real root so define
find

990
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
find
 

991
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,590
find
real rule all right let's say real word

992
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
real rule all right let's say real word
 

993
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,630
real rule all right let's say real word
because it has

994
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
because it has
 

995
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,190
because it has
it has another roots but we are focusing

996
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
it has another roots but we are focusing
 

997
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,190
it has another roots but we are focusing
on real notes

998
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200

 

999
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,430

a b c okay

1000
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,440
a b c okay
 

1001
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,430
a b c okay
give us three numbers nice

1002
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:19,440
give us three numbers nice
 

1003
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,830
give us three numbers nice
so look if a

1004
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
so look if a
 

1005
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,270
so look if a
is zero okay if a0 we will we want to

1006
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
is zero okay if a0 we will we want to
 

1007
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,909
is zero okay if a0 we will we want to
raise exception okay we can say we

1008
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
raise exception okay we can say we
 

1009
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,270
raise exception okay we can say we
value exception or exception

1010
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
value exception or exception
 

1011
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,909
value exception or exception
what's the exception

1012
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
what's the exception
 

1013
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,230
what's the exception
a is zero

1014
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
a is zero
 

1015
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,710
a is zero
exception means that okay um

1016
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
exception means that okay um
 

1017
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,750
exception means that okay um
there's some errors i i yeah it

1018
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
there's some errors i i yeah it
 

1019
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,470
there's some errors i i yeah it
it's quite similar to assert yeah a set

1020
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
it's quite similar to assert yeah a set
 

1021
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,230
it's quite similar to assert yeah a set
yeah

1022
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
yeah
 

1023
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,430
yeah
right

1024
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
right
 

1025
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,950
right
yeah i said it's like what's

1026
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
yeah i said it's like what's
 

1027
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,830
yeah i said it's like what's
computed to up to double check yeah if a

1028
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
computed to up to double check yeah if a
 

1029
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,590
computed to up to double check yeah if a
is zero then i can't continue right

1030
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
is zero then i can't continue right
 

1031
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,669
is zero then i can't continue right
because it's not what i designed these

1032
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
because it's not what i designed these
 

1033
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,470
because it's not what i designed these
arguments all right so let's write the a

1034
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
arguments all right so let's write the a
 

1035
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,110
arguments all right so let's write the a
yeah uh a

1036
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
yeah uh a
 

1037
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,149
yeah uh a
if a equals zero then we return we this

1038
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
if a equals zero then we return we this
 

1039
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,909
if a equals zero then we return we this
an exception and return okay whatever

1040
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
an exception and return okay whatever
 

1041
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,870
an exception and return okay whatever
if

1042
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880
if
 

1043
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,710
if
b square b times times b square minus 4

1044
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
b square b times times b square minus 4
 

1045
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,950
b square b times times b square minus 4
times a times c

1046
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
times a times c
 

1047
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,830
times a times c
right

1048
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
right
 

1049
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,669
right
if it's smaller than zero what does it

1050
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
if it's smaller than zero what does it
 

1051
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,909
if it's smaller than zero what does it
mean

1052
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919

 

1053
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,830

we don't we don't have a blues yeah the

1054
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
we don't we don't have a blues yeah the
 

1055
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,190
we don't we don't have a blues yeah the
graph doesn't have a connection with the

1056
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
graph doesn't have a connection with the
 

1057
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,909
graph doesn't have a connection with the
x-axis right so we can say race

1058
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919
x-axis right so we can say race
 

1059
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,070
x-axis right so we can say race
where is exception okay does that have a

1060
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
where is exception okay does that have a
 

1061
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,270
where is exception okay does that have a
root doesn't

1062
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
root doesn't
 

1063
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,909
root doesn't
uh doesn't have a

1064
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:35,919

 

1065
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,510

yeah i'm just yeah i'm just lazy yeah

1066
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520
yeah i'm just yeah i'm just lazy yeah
 

1067
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,430
yeah i'm just yeah i'm just lazy yeah
raise the extension we don't have any

1068
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
raise the extension we don't have any
 

1069
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,830
raise the extension we don't have any
room real root okay and then now we want

1070
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
room real root okay and then now we want
 

1071
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,630
room real root okay and then now we want
to return to lose yeah so

1072
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:46,640
to return to lose yeah so
 

1073
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,190
to return to lose yeah so
we can sell we can save this uh this

1074
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
we can sell we can save this uh this
 

1075
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,710
we can sell we can save this uh this
term so

1076
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
term so
 

1077
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,510
term so
uh what's this term let's call it

1078
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
uh what's this term let's call it
 

1079
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,350
uh what's this term let's call it
let's call it one ah

1080
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
let's call it one ah
 

1081
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,230
let's call it one ah
equals b square

1082
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,240
equals b square
 

1083
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,870
equals b square
yeah b square this is b square b squared

1084
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
yeah b square this is b square b squared
 

1085
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,870
yeah b square this is b square b squared
you can write b time times one two okay

1086
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
you can write b time times one two okay
 

1087
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,909
you can write b time times one two okay
or

1088
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:03,919
or
 

1089
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,590
or
b times b okay or power

1090
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,600
b times b okay or power
 

1091
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,789
b times b okay or power
b two yeah this three thing same these

1092
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
b two yeah this three thing same these
 

1093
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,029
b two yeah this three thing same these
three are the same yeah

1094
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
three are the same yeah
 

1095
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,430
three are the same yeah
yeah these three are the same

1096
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,440
yeah these three are the same
 

1097
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,990
yeah these three are the same
they are all b square okay

1098
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
they are all b square okay
 

1099
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,990
they are all b square okay
you can already implicitly using this

1100
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
you can already implicitly using this
 

1101
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,870
you can already implicitly using this
approach

1102
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
approach
 

1103
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,029
approach
minus four times a

1104
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
minus four times a
 

1105
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,950
minus four times a
times c okay

1106
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
times c okay
 

1107
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,950
times c okay
i know

1108
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960
i know
 

1109
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,110
i know
we know at this point we know this thing

1110
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
we know at this point we know this thing
 

1111
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,870
we know at this point we know this thing
is bigger or equal than zero so we want

1112
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
is bigger or equal than zero so we want
 

1113
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,110
is bigger or equal than zero so we want
to get the square root of it so we can

1114
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
to get the square root of it so we can
 

1115
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,070
to get the square root of it so we can
do this s q r t max square the x square

1116
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080
do this s q r t max square the x square
 

1117
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,110
do this s q r t max square the x square
root

1118
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
root
 

1119
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,590
root
yeah how do we go the square root

1120
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:39,600
yeah how do we go the square root
 

1121
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,950
yeah how do we go the square root
square root b

1122
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
square root b
 

1123
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,789
square root b
we can we can also have use this is this

1124
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799
we can we can also have use this is this
 

1125
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,990
we can we can also have use this is this
square root sqrt this function b or we

1126
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
square root sqrt this function b or we
 

1127
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,510
square root sqrt this function b or we
can do this b

1128
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
can do this b
 

1129
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,950
can do this b
bit times times what

1130
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
bit times times what
 

1131
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,190
bit times times what
what times one zero point five half

1132
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
what times one zero point five half
 

1133
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,990
what times one zero point five half
right

1134
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
right
 

1135
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,029
right
this is means half all power

1136
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
this is means half all power
 

1137
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,549
this is means half all power
b 0.5 yeah this is the same thing okay

1138
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559
b 0.5 yeah this is the same thing okay
 

1139
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,390
b 0.5 yeah this is the same thing okay
now we have r equals that and another

1140
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
now we have r equals that and another
 

1141
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,789
now we have r equals that and another
two roots you have to root

1142
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
two roots you have to root
 

1143
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,310
two roots you have to root
to lose x1 we use x1 the first rule is

1144
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
to lose x1 we use x1 the first rule is
 

1145
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,350
to lose x1 we use x1 the first rule is
x1 x1 equals

1146
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
x1 x1 equals
 

1147
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,470
x1 x1 equals
yeah let's try this

1148
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
yeah let's try this
 

1149
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,750
yeah let's try this
yeah

1150
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:17,760
yeah
 

1151
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,149
yeah
all right so the first first rule is

1152
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
all right so the first first rule is
 

1153
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,029
all right so the first first rule is
what

1154
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:21,039
what
 

1155
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,230
what
minus c

1156
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
minus c
 

1157
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,190
minus c
plus r

1158
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:25,200
plus r
 

1159
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,029
plus r
divided by

1160
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
divided by
 

1161
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,870
divided by
2 times a right

1162
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
2 times a right
 

1163
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,549
2 times a right
x 2 equals 1 minus b minus r

1164
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:32,559
x 2 equals 1 minus b minus r
 

1165
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,710
x 2 equals 1 minus b minus r
divided by 2 times a and we can return

1166
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
divided by 2 times a and we can return
 

1167
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,470
divided by 2 times a and we can return
this as a cube

1168
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
this as a cube
 

1169
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,350
this as a cube
return q by f what's cuba

1170
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360

two a minus b plus minus

1264
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
two a minus b plus minus
 

1265
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,789
two a minus b plus minus
b squared minus 4ac yeah okay we just

1266
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
b squared minus 4ac yeah okay we just
 

1267
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,590
b squared minus 4ac yeah okay we just
have to plug in the value right

1268
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,600
have to plug in the value right
 

1269
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,190
have to plug in the value right
a is 2

1270
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
a is 2
 

1271
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,110
a is 2
so this thing is 4

1272
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,120
so this thing is 4
 

1273
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,590
so this thing is 4
minus 3. so this thing is 3. b square

1274
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
minus 3. so this thing is 3. b square
 

1275
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,070
minus 3. so this thing is 3. b square
a b squared nine nine

1276
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,080
