2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,640
hello mr harry are you all right

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,080
yeah okay okay

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,280
we want to talk about the first

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,080
recurring characters

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,080
so for example

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,840
what's the foreign it means repeating

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,000
again

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,760
air and then in this case we want to

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,480
return

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,000
the index of the second air right so

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,720
which is zero one two three three you

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,280
start with zero that's what we think

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,200
okay another one a b c d a what's the

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,960
first recurring character a

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,440
so we're gonna do four

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,320
four zero one two three four if there's

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,399
no recurring letters abc minus one one

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,200
is

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,520
okay so we can with this problem right

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,399
so what kind of data structure can we

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,559
use to remember the letters we have seen

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,960
so far you know we have talked about

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,960
this quite a lot of times

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
the data structure

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,960
to remember

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,479
the notebook notebook okay and in

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,600
particular in this case we want to

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,000
remember the notes we have seen so which

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,479
notebook is it

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,479
no you know

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,709
[Music]

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,640
contains the unique letters right but

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,320
hash table is the key value pairs right

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,640
yeah so we want to use the hash set

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,040
to remember the things the letters we

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,680
have seen so far and then if the second

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,560
time we seen this letter before then we

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,680
return its index so we kind of which

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,040
function returns that can we use to

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,360
to re to return a pair a topper of the

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,439
index and the value at the same time

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,920
remember which function

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,040
start with e what was the function e

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,040
liberate yeah

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,720
what's the calling means repeating yeah

47
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,280
so let's say sin

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,280
equals

49
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,239
right and then we can do this for

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,440
i

51
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,920
the value in

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,240
enumerate okay enumerate

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,680
s so if i do this

54
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,040
[Music]

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,519
if i do this

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,120
i which which one is the index which one

57
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,959
is the value i

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,360
is a value because you

59
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,480
i stands for index yeah

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,160
okay index index here okay and

61
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
value is v because

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,280
so that's why is

63
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,360
[Music]

64
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,360
yeah three of them that's fine we all we

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,440
always return the first one we always

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,239
return the first one thing

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,680
i look i know what we want number one

68
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,560
you return the index to the last one

69
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,319
that's a very good question look a b

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,840
a a a we return this in there why

71
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,879
this is the question

72
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
come on

73
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,760
so we rotate so look a

74
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,760
we put it in the set which is this is

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,319
okay and then b

76
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,360
i put it here b

77
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,519
and then a okay it appears before

78
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,840
then i return it okay so what you are

79
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,400
doing with this return the last one

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,439
return the first recurring letter okay

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,439
so what should i do with this

82
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,000
one

83
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,959
boring letter

84
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,920
v right

85
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,640
right yeah i said i said b

86
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,199
okay and then return if we don't have

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,280
minus one minor okay so what do we think

88
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,359
of this problem

89
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,280
it is simple

90
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,800
wow okay single e okay what's the

91
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,199
temperature

92
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,199
what's the temperature

93
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,720
what's the space complexity are we using

94
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,720
any spaces

95
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,600
why is that

96
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,320
because we're losing scene

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:57,560
we're using sin yeah i accidentally said

98
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,560
we're losing we're using well

99
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,160
okay so look if we're not using the set

100
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,800
we can we can also use this we can

101
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,960
usually okay

102
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,199
we can use the dictionary as well right

103
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,280
since equals dictionary right then we

104
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,120
can say if we in t

105
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,260
but instead of dictionary then we can

106
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,039
say this instead of cinder as v

107
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,960
[Music]

108
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,360
so what should we do with this we can

109
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,400
say c we can assign any value of it so

110
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,600
sin

111
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,479
v

112
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,039
okay we can say cv equal anything one

113
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,759
for example or c equals i okay let's

114
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,880
still also okay if we use conditioner

115
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,320
which is

116
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,120
highest paper okay

117
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,000
make sense yeah that's it for today bye

118
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,000
bye

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
meow
