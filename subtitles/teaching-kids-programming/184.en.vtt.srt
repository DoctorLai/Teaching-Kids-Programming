7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,070
um we talked about uh making change
before yeah

8
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
before yeah
 

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,629
before yeah
and today is another problem of making

10
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:14,639
and today is another problem of making
 

11
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,110
and today is another problem of making
change

12
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
change
 

13
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,189
change
let's say we have a making chain one

14
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
let's say we have a making chain one
 

15
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,790
let's say we have a making chain one
one p one pin two two p

16
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
one p one pin two two p
 

17
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,830
one p one pin two two p
five p one twenty p let's say

18
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
five p one twenty p let's say
 

19
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,150
five p one twenty p let's say
okay okay and then twenty five you place

20
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
okay okay and then twenty five you place
 

21
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,589
okay okay and then twenty five you place
twenty five okay

22
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
twenty five okay
 

23
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,470
twenty five okay
just just make it up 25

24
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480

 

25
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,110

okay maybe change five to uh change

26
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
okay maybe change five to uh change
 

27
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,510
okay maybe change five to uh change
change

28
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
change
 

29
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,790
change
1 10 20 25 and then i want to make 60 p

30
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
1 10 20 25 and then i want to make 60 p
 

31
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:54,630
1 10 20 25 and then i want to make 60 p
okay

32
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640

 

33
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,189

okay so one question is that this is the

34
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
okay so one question is that this is the
 

35
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,790
okay so one question is that this is the
target we want to make the change and

36
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
target we want to make the change and
 

37
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,750
target we want to make the change and
then you can pick

38
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
then you can pick
 

39
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,150
then you can pick
you can suppose you have as many

40
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
you can suppose you have as many
 

41
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,070
you can suppose you have as many
unlimited number of each coin so you

42
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
unlimited number of each coin so you
 

43
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,469
unlimited number of each coin so you
have

44
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
have
 

45
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,109
have
you can have a number unlimited of one p

46
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
you can have a number unlimited of one p
 

47
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,630
you can have a number unlimited of one p
10 p twenty three

48
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
10 p twenty three
 

49
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,390
10 p twenty three
the minimum is three why is look

50
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
the minimum is three why is look
 

51
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,710
the minimum is three why is look
we can have 25 25 10 20 20 20

52
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
we can have 25 25 10 20 20 20
 

53
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,910
we can have 25 25 10 20 20 20
yeah okay so this is unlimited it's like

54
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
yeah okay so this is unlimited it's like
 

55
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,870
yeah okay so this is unlimited it's like
unbounded

56
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
unbounded
 

57
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,510
unbounded
unlimited for each one you have a list

58
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
unlimited for each one you have a list
 

59
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,630
unlimited for each one you have a list

this is the one example of i'm body net

64
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
this is the one example of i'm body net
 

65
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,030
this is the one example of i'm body net
sex you know knapsack

66
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
sex you know knapsack
 

67
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:53,030
sex you know knapsack
about it i'm body what's upbody

68
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040

 

69
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,510

can form we can we can describe this

70
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
can form we can we can describe this
 

71
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,389
can form we can we can describe this
problem

72
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
problem
 

73
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,630
problem
in a very general way is that we are

74
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
in a very general way is that we are
 

75
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,749
in a very general way is that we are
given a

76
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
given a
 

77
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,350
given a
bank yeah we are given a back of

78
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
bank yeah we are given a back of
 

79
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,429
bank yeah we are given a back of
capacity

80
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
capacity
 

81
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,869
capacity
60 right about another 60

82
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
60 right about another 60
 

83
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,910
60 right about another 60
and we have a list of the different

84
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
and we have a list of the different
 

85
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,510
and we have a list of the different
items right right items and each

86
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
items right right items and each
 

87
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,949
items right right items and each
item has different weight right

88
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
item has different weight right
 

89
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,510
item has different weight right
and we want to minimize the number of

90
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
and we want to minimize the number of
 

91
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,070
and we want to minimize the number of
items

92
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
items
 

93
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,270
items
to put in the bag right so you can put

94
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
to put in the bag right so you can put
 

95
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,710
to put in the bag right so you can put
20 20 20 or

96
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
20 20 20 or
 

97
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,229
20 20 20 or
you can put 25 25 10

98
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
you can put 25 25 10
 

99
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,790
you can put 25 25 10
and in both cases it's the same you need

100
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
and in both cases it's the same you need
 

101
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,990
and in both cases it's the same you need
to tell me it's three

102
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
to tell me it's three
 

103
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,550
to tell me it's three
number three okay so

104
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
number three okay so
 

105
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,750
number three okay so
okay so we start from the now we saw

106
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
okay so we start from the now we saw
 

107
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,589
okay so we start from the now we saw
that first then we start from the

108
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
that first then we start from the
 

109
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,150
that first then we start from the
biggest okay so you saw the first you

110
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
biggest okay so you saw the first you
 

111
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,550
biggest okay so you saw the first you
from the greedy yeah and then and then

112
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
from the greedy yeah and then and then
 

113
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,270
from the greedy yeah and then and then
and

114
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
and
 

115
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,869
and
and then we did it again and

116
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
and then we did it again and
 

117
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,509
and then we did it again and
to see uh how many you can get right

118
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
to see uh how many you can get right
 

119
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,229
to see uh how many you can get right
yeah

120
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
yeah
 

121
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,910
yeah
so it's 50 and if you do again it will

122
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
so it's 50 and if you do again it will
 

123
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,030
so it's 50 and if you do again it will
be 75

124
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
be 75
 

125
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,670
be 75
so you can't get anything okay but this

126
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
so you can't get anything okay but this
 

127
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,630
so you can't get anything okay but this
may not work

128
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
may not work
 

129
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,710
may not work
right why is that if i don't have 10

130
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
right why is that if i don't have 10
 

131
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,910
right why is that if i don't have 10
then your greedy

132
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
then your greedy
 

133
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,630
then your greedy
is not working right you put the 25 you

134
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
is not working right you put the 25 you
 

135
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,509
is not working right you put the 25 you
start from the

136
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
start from the
 

137
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,589
start from the
you try you try to pick the most

138
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
you try you try to pick the most
 

139
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,190
you try you try to pick the most
heaviest right

140
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
heaviest right
 

141
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,350
heaviest right
but then you run out of choice right

142
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
but then you run out of choice right
 

143
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,589
but then you run out of choice right
yeah yeah so the greedy may not work i'm

144
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
yeah yeah so the greedy may not work i'm
 

145
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,670
yeah yeah so the greedy may not work i'm
right

146
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
right
 

147
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,830
right
target equals

148
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840

 

149
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,149

25 and you only have

150
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
25 and you only have
 

151
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,550
25 and you only have
like one

152
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
like one
 

153
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,869
like one
okay 20

154
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
okay 20
 

155
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,270
okay 20
okay and like five yeah

156
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
okay and like five yeah
 

157
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,110
okay and like five yeah
four six okay then you need uh

158
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
four six okay then you need uh
 

159
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,149
four six okay then you need uh
six yeah because 20

160
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
six yeah because 20
 

161
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,990
six yeah because 20
um maybe no no no you can have four

162
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
um maybe no no no you can have four
 

163
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,149
um maybe no no no you can have four
four six and a one yeah so that would be

164
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
four six and a one yeah so that would be
 

165
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,630
four six and a one yeah so that would be
five

166
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
five
 

167
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,030
five
and then you can have 20 and another

168
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
and then you can have 20 and another
 

169
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,309
and then you can have 20 and another
five

170
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
five
 

171
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,670
five
one how about how about three seven

172
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
one how about how about three seven
 

173
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,030
one how about how about three seven
ten and the top eight okay hey

174
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
ten and the top eight okay hey
 

175
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,550
ten and the top eight okay hey
coming back to the question yeah you

176
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
coming back to the question yeah you
 

177
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,270
coming back to the question yeah you
pick the most heaviest you try 25 25 but

178
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
pick the most heaviest you try 25 25 but
 

179
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,830
pick the most heaviest you try 25 25 but
you're running

180
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
you're running
 

181
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,509
you're running
out of you don't have 10 and then you

182
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
out of you don't have 10 and then you
 

183
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,030
out of you don't have 10 and then you
can only make it up with

184
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
can only make it up with
 

185
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,790
can only make it up with
one right yeah so that may not be

186
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
one right yeah so that may not be
 

187
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,510
one right yeah so that may not be
optimal

188
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:24,520
optimal
 

189
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,670

the greedy is not working here in this

192
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
the greedy is not working here in this
 

193
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,150
the greedy is not working here in this
case i'm just trying to prove that your

194
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
case i'm just trying to prove that your
 

195
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,550
case i'm just trying to prove that your
your solution may not work yeah i can

196
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
your solution may not work yeah i can
 

197
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,030
your solution may not work yeah i can
always find some input that

198
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
always find some input that
 

199
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,150
always find some input that
breaks your algorithm okay okay yeah

200
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
breaks your algorithm okay okay yeah
 

201
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,030
breaks your algorithm okay okay yeah
yeah okay so how can we do this

202
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
yeah okay so how can we do this
 

203
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,430
yeah okay so how can we do this
we can profiles we can search yeah yeah

204
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
we can profiles we can search yeah yeah
 

205
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,749
we can profiles we can search yeah yeah
yeah we can always search but

206
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
yeah we can always search but
 

207
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,830
yeah we can always search but
um

208
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840

 

209
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,550

that's okay because we say that yeah

210
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
that's okay because we say that yeah
 

211
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,189
that's okay because we say that yeah
look at

212
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
look at
 

213
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,350
look at
that coins yeah we have coins and we

214
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
that coins yeah we have coins and we
 

215
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,310
that coins yeah we have coins and we
have a target

216
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
have a target
 

217
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,030
have a target
right attacking the maximum competition

218
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
right attacking the maximum competition
 

219
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,110
right attacking the maximum competition
so we can first

220
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
so we can first
 

221
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,390
so we can first
have to be p p yeah

222
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
have to be p p yeah
 

223
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,590
have to be p p yeah
yeah look 20

224
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
yeah look 20
 

225
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,230
yeah look 20
look this one so for each one we can

226
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
look this one so for each one we can
 

227
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,189
look this one so for each one we can
start from the scarring we can

228
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
start from the scarring we can
 

229
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,909
start from the scarring we can
pick these or we can pick the next one

230
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
pick these or we can pick the next one
 

231
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,629
pick these or we can pick the next one
right

232
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
right
 

233
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,189
right
yeah we can for each item we can pick

234
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
yeah we can for each item we can pick
 

235
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,029
yeah we can for each item we can pick
correct or we can pick next one so it's

236
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
correct or we can pick next one so it's
 

237
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:21,909
correct or we can pick next one so it's
a search yeah

238
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
a search yeah
 

239
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,629
a search yeah
yeah so this is going through the

240
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
yeah so this is going through the
 

241
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,909
yeah so this is going through the
default search yeah

242
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
default search yeah
 

243
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,710
default search yeah
yeah yeah that'll work okay so how about

244
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
yeah yeah that'll work okay so how about
 

245
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,749
yeah yeah that'll work okay so how about
if i tell you

246
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
if i tell you
 

247
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,310
if i tell you
you can solve this problem by dynamic

248
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
you can solve this problem by dynamic
 

249
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,230
you can solve this problem by dynamic

00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
do you still remember dynamic
 

253
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,230
do you still remember dynamic
programming what's dynamic programming

254
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
programming what's dynamic programming
 

255
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,909

me my motivation two down button up yeah

260
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
me my motivation two down button up yeah
 

261
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,350
me my motivation two down button up yeah
yeah remembering so the key point here

262
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
yeah remembering so the key point here
 

263
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,230
yeah remembering so the key point here
is remembering yeah memorization

264
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
is remembering yeah memorization
 

265
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,150
is remembering yeah memorization
so so if i tell you that f f function

266
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
so so if i tell you that f f function
 

267
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,550
so so if i tell you that f f function
f a is the num is the number of the

268
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
f a is the num is the number of the
 

269
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,990
f a is the num is the number of the
coins the number of coins

270
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
coins the number of coins
 

271
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,270
coins the number of coins
we need to make up change a right yeah

272
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
we need to make up change a right yeah
 

273
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,469
we need to make up change a right yeah
so what does it equal i have a list of

274
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
so what does it equal i have a list of
 

275
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,909
so what does it equal i have a list of
items or coins here

276
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
items or coins here
 

277
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,710
items or coins here
i have a list of coins here let's say

278
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
i have a list of coins here let's say
 

279
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,909
i have a list of coins here let's say
the coins

280
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
the coins
 

281
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,390
the coins
i have coins which is a list yeah and i

282
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
i have coins which is a list yeah and i
 

283
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,670
i have coins which is a list yeah and i
can say d

284
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
can say d
 

285
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,870
can say d
belongs to coins yeah this is belongs to

286
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
belongs to coins yeah this is belongs to
 

287
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,749
belongs to coins yeah this is belongs to
so it doesn't mean that i can always

288
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
so it doesn't mean that i can always
 

289
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,870
so it doesn't mean that i can always
pick the minimum

290
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
pick the minimum
 

291
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,629
pick the minimum
look alright eric look pick the animal

00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
one yeah because
 

333
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,469
one yeah because
last time yeah all right yeah i'm just

334
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
last time yeah all right yeah i'm just
 

335
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,469
last time yeah all right yeah i'm just
making up okay

336
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
making up okay
 

337
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,230
making up okay
so what does it mean look if i want to

338
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
so what does it mean look if i want to
 

339
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,469
so what does it mean look if i want to
com make up 60

340
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
com make up 60
 

341
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,749
com make up 60
right i know i can make up 25 right

342
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
right i know i can make up 25 right
 

343
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,510
right i know i can make up 25 right
if this is the coin

344
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
if this is the coin
 

345
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,550
if this is the coin
of making up 6 minus 25 and why why is

346
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
of making up 6 minus 25 and why why is
 

347
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,990
of making up 6 minus 25 and why why is
plus one because i need

348
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
plus one because i need
 

349
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,670
plus one because i need
one more turn one more coin right yeah

350
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
one more turn one more coin right yeah
 

351
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,950
one more turn one more coin right yeah
all right can you explain to me what is

352
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
all right can you explain to me what is
 

353
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,950
all right can you explain to me what is
what's this f sixty minus twenty plus

354
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
what's this f sixty minus twenty plus
 

355
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,230
what's this f sixty minus twenty plus
one what does that mean okay

356
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
one what does that mean okay
 

357
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,909
one what does that mean okay
so uh

358
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919

 

359
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,309

so 16 minus 20 and 20 is a coin

360
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
so 16 minus 20 and 20 is a coin
 

361
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,670
so 16 minus 20 and 20 is a coin
yeah yeah and 60 is the target we want

362
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
yeah yeah and 60 is the target we want
 

363
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,150
yeah yeah and 60 is the target we want
to get

364
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
to get
 

365
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,309
to get
yeah and we add one uh because we need a

366
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
yeah and we add one uh because we need a
 

367
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,990
yeah and we add one uh because we need a
coin okay so what the f60 i know

368
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
coin okay so what the f60 i know
 

369
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,550
coin okay so what the f60 i know
the difference between f60 and f4t is

370
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
the difference between f60 and f4t is
 

371
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,189
the difference between f60 and f4t is
one right

372
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
one right
 

373
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,350
one right
but it's a 20 20 coin yeah i know

374
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
but it's a 20 20 coin yeah i know
 

375
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,629
but it's a 20 20 coin yeah i know
there's 20 here

376
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
there's 20 here
 

377
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,430
there's 20 here
all right all right suppose we know

378
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
all right all right suppose we know
 

379
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,670
all right all right suppose we know
already no effort here

380
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
already no effort here
 

381
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,710
already no effort here
yeah then we can use this value

382
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
yeah then we can use this value
 

383
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,190
yeah then we can use this value
because this value we already save it

384
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
because this value we already save it
 

385
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,909
because this value we already save it
yeah

386
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
yeah
 

387
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,070
yeah
so we don't need to compute this again

388
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
so we don't need to compute this again
 

389
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,430
so we don't need to compute this again
we know f60 because f60 equals f40 plus

390
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
we know f60 because f60 equals f40 plus
 

391
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,709
we know f60 because f60 equals f40 plus
a 20 pound coin

392
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
a 20 pound coin
 

393
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,389
a 20 pound coin
2020 coin right yeah and then these look

394
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
2020 coin right yeah and then these look
 

395
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,509
2020 coin right yeah and then these look
f40 what's f4t f4t equals f

396
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
f40 what's f4t f4t equals f
 

397
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,269
f40 what's f4t f4t equals f
mean of f20 minus 25 plus one f40 minus

398
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
mean of f20 minus 25 plus one f40 minus
 

399
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,230
mean of f20 minus 25 plus one f40 minus
22

400
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
22
 

401
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,389
22
plus one after 15 plus one and f19 plus

402
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
plus one after 15 plus one and f19 plus
 

403
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,070
plus one after 15 plus one and f19 plus
one yeah yeah

404
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
one yeah yeah
 

405
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,949
one yeah yeah
you see so in this case i updated all

406
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
you see so in this case i updated all
 

407
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,070
you see so in this case i updated all
the values between

408
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
the values between
 

409
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,150
the values between
one zero to a right

410
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
one zero to a right
 

411
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,430
one zero to a right
right i don't need to calculate again

412
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
right i don't need to calculate again
 

413
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,670
right i don't need to calculate again
again doesn't make sense

414
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
again doesn't make sense
 

415
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,389
again doesn't make sense
yeah and if dynamic programming we can

416
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
yeah and if dynamic programming we can
 

417
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,350
yeah and if dynamic programming we can
always use

418
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
always use
 

419
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,630
always use
implement in you know in

420
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
implement in you know in
 

421
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,550
implement in you know in
how many ways are top down and bottom up

422
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
how many ways are top down and bottom up
 

423
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,310
how many ways are top down and bottom up
right

424
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
right
 

425
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,230
right
let let's implement the button up first

426
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
let let's implement the button up first
 

427
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,750
let let's implement the button up first
look eric define

428
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
look eric define
 

429
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,790
look eric define
f and then that's the amount

430
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
f and then that's the amount
 

431
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,829
f and then that's the amount
right amount and the coins yeah coins

432
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
right amount and the coins yeah coins
 

433
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,949
right amount and the coins yeah coins
column okay look eric

434
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
column okay look eric
 

435
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,550
column okay look eric
so first of all we need to we need to

436
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
so first of all we need to we need to
 

437
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,590
so first of all we need to we need to
have this array at least to store the f

438
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
have this array at least to store the f
 

439
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,670
have this array at least to store the f
s right f 0 is what

440
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
s right f 0 is what
 

441
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,710
s right f 0 is what
is f yellow if the zero

442
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
is f yellow if the zero
 

443
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,949
is f yellow if the zero
nothing how many ways can you make it

444
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
nothing how many ways can you make it
 

445
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,750
nothing how many ways can you make it
nothing

446
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
nothing
 

447
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,030
nothing
it's nothing yeah so look

448
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
it's nothing yeah so look
 

449
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,070
it's nothing yeah so look
let's say uh let's

450
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
let's say uh let's
 

451
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,030
let's say uh let's
change this to dp okay and let's f

452
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
change this to dp okay and let's f
 

453
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,310
change this to dp okay and let's f
equals

454
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
equals
 

455
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,340
equals
look at zero this is f zero yeah

456
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:08,350
look at zero this is f zero yeah
 

457
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,509
look at zero this is f zero yeah

plus at the beginning look eric

460
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
plus at the beginning look eric
 

461
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,310
plus at the beginning look eric
so in the beginning we maybe they

462
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
so in the beginning we maybe they
 

463
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,710
so in the beginning we maybe they
it's not possible to make up the money

464
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
it's not possible to make up the money
 

465
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,470
it's not possible to make up the money
right if you want to make a 60 and

466
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
right if you want to make a 60 and
 

467
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,670
right if you want to make a 60 and
you only have uh like uh you only have

468
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
you only have uh like uh you only have
 

469
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,870
you only have uh like uh you only have
13 there's no way to make up 60 using 13

470
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
13 there's no way to make up 60 using 13
 

471
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,750
13 there's no way to make up 60 using 13
right

472
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
right
 

473
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,110
right
yes all right

474
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
yes all right
 

475
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,310
yes all right
doesn't make sense so so if

476
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
doesn't make sense so so if
 

477
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,590
doesn't make sense so so if
if f let's say if

478
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
if f let's say if
 

479
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,430
if f let's say if
look for example f 60 equals f

480
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
look for example f 60 equals f
 

481
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,630
look for example f 60 equals f
14 uh 16

482
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
14 uh 16
 

483
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,550
14 uh 16
minus 60 minus 14 plus 1 yeah all right

484
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
minus 60 minus 14 plus 1 yeah all right
 

485
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,670
minus 60 minus 14 plus 1 yeah all right
but if this one we cannot make it let's

486
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
but if this one we cannot make it let's
 

487
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,310
but if this one we cannot make it let's
say we

488
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
say we
 

489
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,509
say we
we make it a very big number

490
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
we make it a very big number
 

491
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,590
we make it a very big number
right infinity right if this is infinity

492
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
right infinity right if this is infinity
 

493
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,910
right infinity right if this is infinity
right they'll be possible because

494
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
right they'll be possible because
 

495
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,310
right they'll be possible because
there's no way to make up f 60 minus 14

496
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
there's no way to make up f 60 minus 14
 

497
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,710
there's no way to make up f 60 minus 14
yeah

498
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
yeah
 

499
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,230
yeah
for a certain so so that initial value

500
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
for a certain so so that initial value
 

501
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,870
for a certain so so that initial value
is

502
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
is
 

503
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,630
is
very messed up infinity

504
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
very messed up infinity
 

505
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,150
very messed up infinity
times amount right hey what

506
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
times amount right hey what
 

507
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,870
times amount right hey what
what what's the y like that this is look

508
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
what what's the y like that this is look
 

509
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,829
what what's the y like that this is look
so f is the least the first list is zero

510
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
so f is the least the first list is zero
 

511
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,269
so f is the least the first list is zero
and then

512
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:25,279
and then
 

513
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,710
and then
the layer a or a times

514
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
the layer a or a times
 

515
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,990
the layer a or a times
of the mass of infinity so what's f f

516
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
of the mass of infinity so what's f f
 

517
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,550
of the mass of infinity so what's f f
it will be like this eric look at this

518
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
it will be like this eric look at this
 

519
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,430
it will be like this eric look at this
look at here

520
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
look at here
 

521
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,150
look at here
so what's f value it will be zero the

522
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
so what's f value it will be zero the
 

523
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,790
so what's f value it will be zero the
second one

524
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
second one
 

525
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,710
second one
second value will be what

526
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720

 

527
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,509

infinity so you'll be infinity and then

528
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
infinity so you'll be infinity and then
 

529
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,710
infinity so you'll be infinity and then
infinity and then how many of these

530
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
infinity and then how many of these
 

531
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,190
infinity and then how many of these
how many of these this is at least f of

532
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200

 

533
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,389

uh the these minus one no a

534
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
uh the these minus one no a
 

535
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,190
uh the these minus one no a
come on times a here this is look that's

536
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
come on times a here this is look that's
 

537
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,069
come on times a here this is look that's
what it means

538
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
what it means
 

539
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,750
what it means
the first one zero plus a times

540
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
the first one zero plus a times
 

541
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,110
the first one zero plus a times
of least okay so that's the least of f

542
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
of least okay so that's the least of f
 

543
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,230
of least okay so that's the least of f
f equals that yeah okay

544
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
f equals that yeah okay
 

545
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,190
f equals that yeah okay
and then what's next and what's next

546
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
and then what's next and what's next
 

547
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,230
and then what's next and what's next
and look for what

548
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
and look for what
 

549
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,069
and look for what
for i in

550
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
for i in
 

551
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,110
for i in
range what's i

552
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
range what's i
 

553
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,230
range what's i
a very rare for i in range

554
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
a very rare for i in range
 

555
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,230
a very rare for i in range
start from what from one

556
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
start from what from one
 

557
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,430
start from what from one
to a mouth plus one yeah we want to

558
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
to a mouth plus one yeah we want to
 

559
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,750
to a mouth plus one yeah we want to
calculate we want to calculate the f i

560
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
calculate we want to calculate the f i
 

561
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,269
calculate we want to calculate the f i
value right

562
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
value right
 

563
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,629
value right
and then fro for coin c

564
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
and then fro for coin c
 

565
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,430
and then fro for coin c
in coins yeah we have now we are coming

566
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
in coins yeah we have now we are coming
 

567
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,230
in coins yeah we have now we are coming
all right

568
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
all right
 

569
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,470
all right
let's see yeah

570
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
let's see yeah
 

571
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,829
let's see yeah
look if if current

572
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
look if if current
 

573
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,430
look if if current
coin if the current amount is bigger or

574
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
coin if the current amount is bigger or
 

575
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,310
coin if the current amount is bigger or
equal than

576
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
equal than
 

577
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,750
equal than
c right all right yeah

578
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
c right all right yeah
 

579
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,150
c right all right yeah
if the amount is smaller than the coin

580
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
if the amount is smaller than the coin
 

581
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,389
if the amount is smaller than the coin
it means it's not possible yeah if you

582
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
it means it's not possible yeah if you
 

583
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,430
it means it's not possible yeah if you
yeah it has to be bigger yeah yeah

584
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
yeah it has to be bigger yeah yeah
 

585
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,710
yeah it has to be bigger yeah yeah
and at least one of them and what

586
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
and at least one of them and what
 

587
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,990
and at least one of them and what
and f f1 i

588
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
and f f1 i
 

589
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,069
and f f1 i
minus c right what did i say f i minus c

590
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
minus c right what did i say f i minus c
 

591
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,670
minus c right what did i say f i minus c
not equals mass dot infinity yeah if we

592
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
not equals mass dot infinity yeah if we
 

593
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,069
not equals mass dot infinity yeah if we
can make up this yeah

594
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
can make up this yeah
 

595
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,829
can make up this yeah
so what what should we do f

596
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
so what what should we do f
 

597
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,470
so what what should we do f
i we are calculating the fy value yeah

598
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
i we are calculating the fy value yeah
 

599
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,670
i we are calculating the fy value yeah
equals mean

600
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680

 

601
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,990

f i minus c

602
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
f i minus c
 

603
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,269
f i minus c
plus one and f i right we want to keep

604
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
plus one and f i right we want to keep
 

605
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:45,670
plus one and f i right we want to keep
the

606
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
the
 

607
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,710
the
minimum all right all right does it make

608
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
minimum all right all right does it make
 

609
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,110
minimum all right all right does it make
sense

610
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120

 

611
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,949

okay ryan are you okay all right

612
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
okay ryan are you okay all right
 

613
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,870
okay ryan are you okay all right
all right explain it again okay fi is

614
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
all right explain it again okay fi is
 

615
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,470
all right explain it again okay fi is
the value we only calculate the amount

616
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
the value we only calculate the amount
 

617
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,430
the value we only calculate the amount
right

618
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440
right
 

619
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:12,949
right
we start from the y

620
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959

 

621
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,310

which four is from the bottom to the top

622
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
which four is from the bottom to the top
 

623
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,910
which four is from the bottom to the top
there are two four pick one which one is

624
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
there are two four pick one which one is
 

625
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,069
there are two four pick one which one is
the from the bottom to the top

626
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079

 

627
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,629

this one yeah because f i f i start from

628
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639
this one yeah because f i f i start from
 

629
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,189
this one yeah because f i f i start from
one

630
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:25,199
one
 

631
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,550
one
one right f yellow is yellow we already

632
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
one right f yellow is yellow we already
 

633
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:28,870
one right f yellow is yellow we already
know

634
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
know
 

635
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,069
know
f1 to a so

636
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
f1 to a so
 

637
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,069
f1 to a so
the i will start from one two three

638
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
the i will start from one two three
 

639
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,509
the i will start from one two three
until a right

640
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
until a right
 

641
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,910
until a right
yeah for each four and i choose the

642
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
yeah for each four and i choose the
 

643
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,670
yeah for each four and i choose the
coins and then you i

644
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
coins and then you i
 

645
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,069
coins and then you i
bigger than c and i might what's this

646
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
bigger than c and i might what's this
 

647
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,949
bigger than c and i might what's this
area

648
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
area
 

649
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,150
area
what's this i know what does it mean

650
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
what's this i know what does it mean
 

651
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,550
what's this i know what does it mean
here what does it mean here

652
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
here what does it mean here
 

653
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,910
here what does it mean here
i just tell you i explained two times if

654
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
i just tell you i explained two times if
 

655
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,629
i just tell you i explained two times if
uh the f

656
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639

 

657
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,910

is see okay so f

658
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
is see okay so f
 

659
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,509
is see okay so f
uh we have a valley

660
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
uh we have a valley
 

661
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,110
uh we have a valley
minus the coin yeah it's not

662
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
minus the coin yeah it's not
 

663
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,550
minus the coin yeah it's not
equal to infinity is initial what does

664
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
equal to infinity is initial what does
 

665
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,110
equal to infinity is initial what does
it mean

666
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
it mean
 

667
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,629
it mean
i mean it can be yeah you know it can be

668
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:14,639
i mean it can be yeah you know it can be
 

669
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,030
i mean it can be yeah you know it can be
we can we know already how to make up

670
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
we can we know already how to make up
 

671
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,550
we can we know already how to make up
the money right

672
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
the money right
 

673
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,949
the money right
for example 60 and we already know how

674
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
for example 60 and we already know how
 

675
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:21,670
for example 60 and we already know how
to make up

676
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
to make up
 

677
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,189
to make up
40. if we there is no way to make a 40

678
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199
40. if we there is no way to make a 40
 

679
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,310
40. if we there is no way to make a 40
and it's we we don't need to calculate

680
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
and it's we we don't need to calculate
 

681
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,829
and it's we we don't need to calculate
this right all right

682
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
this right all right
 

683
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,710
this right all right
yeah yeah okay and then what should we

684
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
yeah yeah okay and then what should we
 

685
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,189
yeah yeah okay and then what should we
return

686
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
return
 

687
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:49,990
return
the last value return which one

688
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000

 

689
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,509

what are we calculating here a a or f

690
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,519
what are we calculating here a a or f
 

691
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,509
what are we calculating here a a or f
minus one yeah the last value yeah all

692
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
minus one yeah the last value yeah all
 

693
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,430
minus one yeah the last value yeah all
right yes

694
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
right yes
 

695
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,150
right yes
okay look if s minus one is a mass

696
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
okay look if s minus one is a mass
 

697
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,670
okay look if s minus one is a mass
infinity it means there's no way to

698
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
infinity it means there's no way to
 

699
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,870
infinity it means there's no way to
calculate it right

700
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
calculate it right
 

701
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,949
calculate it right
yes am i yeah yeah it could be possible

702
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
yes am i yeah yeah it could be possible
 

703
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:07,990
yes am i yeah yeah it could be possible
that we can't make

704
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
that we can't make
 

705
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,949
that we can't make
anything up to that f amount right like

706
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
anything up to that f amount right like
 

707
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:11,829
anything up to that f amount right like
16.

708
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
16.
 

709
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,110
16.
uh if you only have 13 about uh

710
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
uh if you only have 13 about uh
 

711
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,710
uh if you only have 13 about uh
13 10 you can't make 60 using the 13 10

712
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
13 10 you can't make 60 using the 13 10
 

713
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,590
13 10 you can't make 60 using the 13 10
right

714
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
right
 

715
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,269
right
yeah doesn't make sense because

716
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
yeah doesn't make sense because
 

717
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,990
yeah doesn't make sense because
60 cannot be divided by 13 right you can

718
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
60 cannot be divided by 13 right you can
 

719
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,670
60 cannot be divided by 13 right you can
only use one two three four

720
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
only use one two three four
 

721
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,949
only use one two three four
and you can't make up 60 all right

722
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
and you can't make up 60 all right
 

723
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,069
and you can't make up 60 all right
all right doesn't make sense nothing

724
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
all right doesn't make sense nothing
 

725
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,189
all right doesn't make sense nothing
no i'm still going to talk about the uh

00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
no i'm still going to talk about the uh

top down
 

729
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,829

00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
and we know we have i watch the time
 

735
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,590
and we know we have i watch the time
complexity for for that one

736
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
complexity for for that one

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,670
complexity for for that one
i forgot to ask oh what if the amount is

00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
i forgot to ask oh what if the amount is

[Music]
 

747
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,470

yeah why is that because we have a for

748
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
yeah why is that because we have a for
 

749
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,309
yeah why is that because we have a for
loop for the first form

750
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
loop for the first form
 

751
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,789
loop for the first form
we have nine that's amount yeah and for

752
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
we have nine that's amount yeah and for
 

753
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,990
we have nine that's amount yeah and for
the second

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
the second
 

755
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,710
the second
four when the coins then what what's the

756
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
four when the coins then what what's the
 

757
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,470
four when the coins then what what's the
what's the time complexity of the second

758
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
what's the time complexity of the second

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,110
what's the time complexity of the second

761
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,829

yes and then times together you'll be oa
 

767
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,710
yes and then times together you'll be oa
right

768
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
right
 

769
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,710

wait return zero yeah remember let's
 

823
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,510
wait return zero yeah remember let's
think dp

824
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
think dp
 

825
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,630
think dp
equals zero plus plus times infinity

826
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
equals zero plus plus times infinity
 

827
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,350
equals zero plus plus times infinity
right

828
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,360
right
 

829
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,190
right
yeah a times infinity remember the

830
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
yeah a times infinity remember the
 

831
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,470
yeah a times infinity remember the
previous one but

832
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
previous one but
 

833
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,750
previous one but
basically it's the same it's the same

834
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:54,760
basically it's the same it's the same
 

835
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,789
basically it's the same it's the same
implementation same idea but different

836
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:56,799
implementation same idea but different
 

837
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,470
implementation same idea but different
implementation yeah

838
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
implementation yeah
 

839
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,590
implementation yeah
okay now now

840
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
okay now now
 

841
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,430
okay now now
i have this a i want to calculate a and

842
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:05,440
i have this a i want to calculate a and
 

843
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,510
i have this a i want to calculate a and
i have let's say answer

844
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
i have let's say answer
 

845
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,590
i have let's say answer
equals mass stock infinity yeah

846
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,600
equals mass stock infinity yeah
 

847
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,590
equals mass stock infinity yeah
all right at the beginning i'm not sure

848
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
all right at the beginning i'm not sure
 

849
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,870
all right at the beginning i'm not sure
which one is it

850
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
which one is it
 

851
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,710
which one is it
ryan right this is a lot yeah

852
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
ryan right this is a lot yeah
 

853
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,430
ryan right this is a lot yeah
yeah and then i need to iterate over the

854
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
yeah and then i need to iterate over the
 

855
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,230
yeah and then i need to iterate over the
coins

856
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,240
coins
 

857
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,909
coins
yeah all right

858
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
yeah all right
 

859
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,750
yeah all right
i look it's the same if

860
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760

 

861
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,830

right

862
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840

 

863
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,909

if

864
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919

 

865
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,430

coin is smaller than equal one

866
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
coin is smaller than equal one
 

867
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,710
coin is smaller than equal one
if the coin is smaller than equal one

868
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
if the coin is smaller than equal one
 

869
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,070
if the coin is smaller than equal one
it's smaller than an equal

870
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,080
it's smaller than an equal
 

871
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,669
it's smaller than an equal
in the coin yeah if that

872
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
in the coin yeah if that
 

873
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,070
in the coin yeah if that
coin is smaller than a right then we can

874
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
coin is smaller than a right then we can
 

875
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,190
coin is smaller than a right then we can
check

876
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
check
 

877
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,390
check
and let's say let's say x x

878
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
and let's say let's say x x
 

879
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,830
and let's say let's say x x
equals f a

880
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840
equals f a
 

881
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,710
equals f a
minus a minus one

882
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
minus a minus one
 

883
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,549
minus a minus one
a minus

884
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559

 

885
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,630

now the coin is smaller than a and i

886
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
now the coin is smaller than a and i
 

887
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,830
now the coin is smaller than a and i
want to try

888
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:15,840
want to try
 

889
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,350
want to try
a minus c yes and if

890
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
a minus c yes and if
 

891
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,029
a minus c yes and if
x is not equal mass to infinity

892
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:23,039
x is not equal mass to infinity
 

893
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,870
x is not equal mass to infinity
if we can make it yeah all right

894
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
if we can make it yeah all right
 

895
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,310
if we can make it yeah all right
and answer equals what can you tell me

896
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
and answer equals what can you tell me
 

897
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,430
and answer equals what can you tell me
answer equal one and return

898
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
answer equal one and return
 

899
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,870
answer equal one and return
oh yeah okay

900
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880

 

901
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,270

yeah that's very obvious yeah can you

902
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
yeah that's very obvious yeah can you
 

903
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,149
yeah that's very obvious yeah can you
need that one

904
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
need that one
 

905
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,830
need that one
no no no this is the key point what's

906
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:46,840

 

907
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,270

good

908
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
good
 

909
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,190
good
yeah minimal yeah you know what i'm

910
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
yeah minimal yeah you know what i'm
 

911
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,390
yeah minimal yeah you know what i'm
talking about because we want to

912
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
talking about because we want to
 

913
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,950
talking about because we want to
calculate the minimum of what

914
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
calculate the minimum of what
 

915
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,470
calculate the minimum of what
the minimum

916
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:58,480

 

917
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,710

answer yes we want to keep updating the

918
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
answer yes we want to keep updating the
 

919
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,669
answer yes we want to keep updating the
minimum

920
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:01,679
minimum
 

921
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,669
minimum
and then what and what

922
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
and then what and what
 

923
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,950
and then what and what
what a a is the constant

924
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
what a a is the constant
 

925
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,870
what a a is the constant
we are what are we calculating x yes

926
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880

 

927
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,710

that's one mistake there's one problem

928
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
that's one mistake there's one problem
 

929
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,870
that's one mistake there's one problem
you're so close to it

930
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
you're so close to it
 

931
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,549
you're so close to it
mass infinity there's a

932
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
mass infinity there's a
 

933
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,669
mass infinity there's a
no infinity

934
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
no infinity
 

935
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,270
no infinity
x is f a minus c if we use the coin c

936
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
x is f a minus c if we use the coin c
 

937
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,549
x is f a minus c if we use the coin c
then how many f a what's the f a and

938
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
then how many f a what's the f a and
 

939
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,149
then how many f a what's the f a and
f minus a minus c what's the difference

940
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159
f minus a minus c what's the difference
 

941
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:36,630
f minus a minus c what's the difference
between

942
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:36,640
between
 

943
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,230
between
f a and f a minus c

944
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240
f a and f a minus c
 

945
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,830
f a and f a minus c
c minus c 16

946
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:43,840
c minus c 16
 

947
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,190
c minus c 16
and we have 40p we have 20p

948
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,200
and we have 40p we have 20p
 

949
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,990
and we have 40p we have 20p
so what's how many coins different the

950
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,000
so what's how many coins different the
 

951
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,870
so what's how many coins different the
60p and 40p

952
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
60p and 40p
 

953
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,750
60p and 40p
20p is how many coins are these how many

954
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
20p is how many coins are these how many
 

955
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,350
20p is how many coins are these how many
coins the number of coins

956
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360

 

957
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,350

i have a 6p 60b is the target

958
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,360
i have a 6p 60b is the target
 

959
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,710
i have a 6p 60b is the target
and i have a point 20 p

960
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,720
and i have a point 20 p
 

961
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,070
and i have a point 20 p
yeah and we want to know the number of

962
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,080
yeah and we want to know the number of
 

963
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,390
yeah and we want to know the number of
the

964
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
the
 

965
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,950
the
coins the minimum number of coins to

966
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
coins the minimum number of coins to
 

967
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,630
coins the minimum number of coins to
make up 60.

968
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
make up 60.
 

969
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,230
make up 60.
yeah so f 60 equals

970
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
yeah so f 60 equals
 

971
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,510
yeah so f 60 equals
f 60 minus 20

972
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:23,520
f 60 minus 20
 

973
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,710
f 60 minus 20
plus what how many coins

974
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720

 

975
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,230

plus one yes and what's here

976
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
plus one yes and what's here
 

977
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,190
plus one yes and what's here
plus one yeah x plus one doesn't make

978
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,200
plus one yeah x plus one doesn't make
 

979
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,029
plus one yeah x plus one doesn't make
sense because we already have

980
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
sense because we already have
 

981
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,149
sense because we already have
coin c we know we calculate f a minus c

982
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
coin c we know we calculate f a minus c
 

983
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,430
coin c we know we calculate f a minus c
we use the coin c

984
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,440
we use the coin c
 

985
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,830
we use the coin c
so we need to add it back plus one all

986
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
so we need to add it back plus one all
 

987
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,789
so we need to add it back plus one all
right

988
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:44,799
right
 

989
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,430
right
yeah what what's the time conductor

990
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
yeah what what's the time conductor
 

991
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,310
yeah what what's the time conductor
before this one

992
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,320
before this one
 

993
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:57,110
before this one
i swear what's the time complexity

994
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120

 

995
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,149

and this is n and that's a what's the

996
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
and this is n and that's a what's the
 

997
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,029
and this is n and that's a what's the
sample message

998
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
sample message
 

999
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,669
sample message
f-a-n oh yeah it's the same yeah what's

1000
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:03,679
f-a-n oh yeah it's the same yeah what's
 

1001
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,830
f-a-n oh yeah it's the same yeah what's
the space complexity

1002
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
the space complexity
 

1003
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,950
the space complexity
a yeah yeah but for this one is

1004
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
a yeah yeah but for this one is
 

1005
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,669
a yeah yeah but for this one is
recursion

1006
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:09,679
recursion
 

1007
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,789
recursion
with minimization but but if this a

1008
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
with minimization but but if this a
 

1009
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,630
with minimization but but if this a
is a minion what does it mean you need

1010
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640
is a minion what does it mean you need
 

1011
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,310
is a minion what does it mean you need
to call this function many many times

1012
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320
to call this function many many times
 

1013
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,830
to call this function many many times
which is not good

1014
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
which is not good
 

1015
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,310
which is not good
right so it's better to in this case the

1016
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,320
right so it's better to in this case the
 

1017
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,430
right so it's better to in this case the
bottom up is

1018
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
bottom up is
 

1019
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,990
bottom up is
preferred we prefer the butter up right

1020
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
preferred we prefer the butter up right
 

1021
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,789
preferred we prefer the butter up right
because we

1022
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
because we
 

1023
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,950
because we
we don't we we don't call the function

1024
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
we don't we we don't call the function
 

1025
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,310
we don't we we don't call the function
over and over again right because

1026
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
over and over again right because
 

1027
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,590
over and over again right because
there's overhead

1028
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
there's overhead
 

1029
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,430
there's overhead
let's overhead to call this function

1030
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
let's overhead to call this function
 

1031
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,990
let's overhead to call this function
right look the computer needs to call a

1032
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
right look the computer needs to call a
 

1033
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,510
right look the computer needs to call a
function all right

1034
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
function all right
 

1035
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,789
function all right
yeah so in general

1036
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799
yeah so in general
 

1037
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,950
yeah so in general
so in general advantage of top down

1038
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
so in general advantage of top down
 

1039
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,669
so in general advantage of top down
right advantage of top now is that it's

1040
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
right advantage of top now is that it's
 

1041
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,390
right advantage of top now is that it's
very

1042
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
very
 

1043
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,830
very
i mean human readable all right because

1044
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:49,840
i mean human readable all right because
 

1045
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,230
i mean human readable all right because
look i just defined if a equals zero

1046
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:52,240
look i just defined if a equals zero
 

1047
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,070
look i just defined if a equals zero
deletes otherwise do this call

1048
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,080
deletes otherwise do this call
 

1049
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,909
deletes otherwise do this call
calling this application is human

1050
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
calling this application is human
 

1051
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,110
calling this application is human
readable

1052
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
readable
 

1053
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,990
readable
you human you friendly but butter up is

1054
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
you human you friendly but butter up is
 

1055
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,630
you human you friendly but butter up is
more like

1056
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
more like
 

1057
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,029
more like
computer friendly because the computer

1058
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,039
computer friendly because the computer
 

1059
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,470
computer friendly because the computer
don't need to

1060
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
don't need to
 

1061
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,549
don't need to
you tell the computer more efficiently

1062
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
you tell the computer more efficiently
 

1063
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,590
you tell the computer more efficiently
to save other

1064
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
to save other
 

1065
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,430
to save other
values right yes they're both equivalent

1066
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
values right yes they're both equivalent
 

1067
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,710
values right yes they're both equivalent
but it uh they both the in terms of the

1068
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
but it uh they both the in terms of the
 

1069
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,510
but it uh they both the in terms of the
agreement

1070
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:15,520
agreement
 

1071
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,549
agreement
your term complexity in theory that they

1072
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
your term complexity in theory that they
 

1073
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,669
your term complexity in theory that they
are equivalent

1074
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
are equivalent
 

1075
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,190
are equivalent
but but in practice

1076
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,200
but but in practice
 

1077
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,630
but but in practice
we prefer the butter up right all right

1078
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
we prefer the butter up right all right
 

1079
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,950
we prefer the butter up right all right
okay and uh

1080
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
okay and uh
 

1081
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,590
okay and uh
yeah yeah what

1082
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
yeah yeah what
 

1083
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,590
yeah yeah what
what we have used the coin we have tried

1084
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,600
what we have used the coin we have tried
 

1085
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,710
what we have used the coin we have tried
to put this

1086
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:40,720
to put this
 

1087
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,789
to put this
yeah come on

1088
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
yeah come on
 

1089
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,630
yeah come on
equals something about c yeah yeah look

1090
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:50,640
equals something about c yeah yeah look
 

1091
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,750
equals something about c yeah yeah look
we we are currently we want to array we

1092
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760
we we are currently we want to array we
 

1093
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,230
we we are currently we want to array we
are currently making of the a

1094
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
are currently making of the a
 

1095
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,430
are currently making of the a
and then we want to try the c c value so

1096
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
and then we want to try the c c value so
 

1097
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,789
and then we want to try the c c value so
what s

1098
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
what s
 

1099
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,110
what s
s we want to call the value f1

1100
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,120
s we want to call the value f1
 

1101
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,549
s we want to call the value f1
f1 f1 a

1102
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
f1 f1 a
 

1103
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,630
f1 f1 a
f what yeah calling the decretion right

1104
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
f what yeah calling the decretion right
 

1105
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,630
f what yeah calling the decretion right
this is because you say with cushion and

1106
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
this is because you say with cushion and
 

1107
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,750
this is because you say with cushion and
what currently

1108
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:15,760
what currently
 

1109
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,950
what currently
a is called is smaller than a so

1110
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
a is called is smaller than a so
 

1111
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,230
a is called is smaller than a so
what do we need to do if this is a

1112
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
what do we need to do if this is a
 

1113
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:36,149
what do we need to do if this is a
this is c come on it's right here

1114
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:36,159

 

1115
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,070

here right this is the dynamic

1116
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,080
here right this is the dynamic
 

1117
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,590
here right this is the dynamic
programming okay we talked about this

1118
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
programming okay we talked about this
 

1119
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,870
programming okay we talked about this
before

1120
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
before
 

1121
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,840
before
okay that's it for today
