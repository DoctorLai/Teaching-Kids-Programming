1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,640
hello mr eric are you right

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,440
okay

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,279
so

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,719
remember we talked about professor

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,840
stephan right okay so that's one easy

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,599
graph one a b

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,920
c

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,920
the

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,439
e

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,800
okay so this is the quad

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,119
and directive yeah undirected there is

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,119
no direction undirected

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,760
graph okay and then

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,760
what's the perfect search order if we

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,920
start from a this is the sauce

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,079
a b c d e

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,840
and we use the q right yeah we push the

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,840
look at the beginning we push the q q

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,960
equals a right no right

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,160
so we take a no a we visit it yeah

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,399
yeah of course because it's a graph

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,559
and we don't want to revisit the note b

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,760
again once we visit it right so we take

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,840
the a out we check if we have a scene

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,720
and we have a signal we have seen we

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,119
have we have not seen a before so we put

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,479
this is output yeah we visited and we

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,280
put a here

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,640
what's the a's children b c d they'll

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,080
push the kids

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,560
into it

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,439
we take the b b out

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
right

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,640
yeah

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,200
we take b out

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,439
if it's not seen right we put it out

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,840
and then we put it we put this in here

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,759
what's the peace children

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,040
what's these children

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,040
these children

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,000
and

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,280
because it's un-directional look i

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,280
understand i think

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,680
a is already seen right

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,880
yeah so we don't we don't put it but

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,479
okay so b we put a we don't we don't put

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,960
it there's a way uh

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,799
we can check the theme check even note

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,360
we need to check if the note has been

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,920
visited before we push it to the queue

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,719
so it's been visited so we don't push it

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,960
to the queue so we only push the e out

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,040
right and we take the c out

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,200
we take the cr

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,319
we put a scene here what's the c's

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
children

57
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,400
hey right but we have visited here so we

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,120
don't push it right so continue we take

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,120
a dr

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,840
and now what's the these children

61
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:28,239
what's this chosen

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,400
a visited so we don't put it yeah and a

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,680
uh

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,640
uh yeah hey we uh we visited so we don't

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,120
put it yeah so let's let's put a d here

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,280
and then we take it er okay

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,879
so let's let's give us the order and

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,800
then we take e

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,120
a b c d e okay

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,400
what's the definite search

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,879
order if we start from a

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
a b e

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,560
a b e

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
c

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,120
d c

76
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,159
okay

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,720
a b e d c so to sum up the breakfast

78
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,440
search travel level by level so it

79
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,519
always increase the distance right so

80
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,560
when we find the c

81
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,640
we know

82
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,640
it's the shortest distance right if it's

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,319
an undirected graph we we know it's the

84
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,040
circ

85
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,760
or a to e right

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,879
for the data search we explore the nodes

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,280
until we can't right look we go to b and

88
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,080
now i'm just trying to follow the load

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
b

90
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,879
to e

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,480
this is quite similar to traveling the

92
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,680
binary tree and we talked about binaural

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,799
trees quite a lot right a b c d

94
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,760
a

95
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,720
b

96
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
c

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
d

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,879
e

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,440
f g i

100
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,680
a to b and i can travel to d

101
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,400
and i go back to e

102
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,840
c

103
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,480
f g and the process is a b c

104
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,560
d e f g okay for like breakfast for a

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,959
different search we use the stack but

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,120
usually we implement with the recursion

107
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,959
and then the computer

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,879
to maintain the stack for us because we

109
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,200
call a recursion then computer has the

110
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,880
stack right so the computer needs to

111
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,239
push the core into a stack yeah

112
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,320
so define

113
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,840
therefore search we are covering a

114
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,759
current right

115
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,440
so obviously there is a scene somewhere

116
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,320
we can put in the parameter or here

117
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,680
right

118
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,120
so if current in sin

119
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,800
we just don't continue with this return

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,000
otherwise for the note in

121
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,160
g

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,560
g is a graph at current

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
and then we can definitely search and

124
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,199
all right

125
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,440
yeah

126
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,040
and obviously we have to put it if we

127
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,360
check the current diffusion scene then

128
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,520
if not then we seen.add

129
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,360
a column

130
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,680
and that's the difference let's

131
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,280
in a calling exam right

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,840
g graph g g is the verb

133
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,440
a set of the vertex and edge right so we

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,160
can use the g

135
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,639
g

136
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,240
the vertex here that will give us the

137
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,840
list of the nodes

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
which for example g a

139
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,840
a will be a list of nodes connected to a

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,080
which is

141
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,479
b c d

142
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,160
this is called this is the way

143
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,240
to store the graph which is called

144
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,759
adjacent right

145
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,199
a g a d j a c an adjacent list

146
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,520
because we can

147
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,800
get the list of nodes it connects it

148
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,759
look

149
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,880
a connects to bcd okay how about g b so

150
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,919
what what does g b give us

151
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
g b

152
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,919
what's the g b give us

153
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,840
what's the nelson

154
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,440
e yeah and e okay you get it again this

155
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,440
is this adjacent metric is different

156
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,639
adjacent metric is the metric

157
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,600
right so if you have a metric one zero

158
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,800
one

159
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
zero

160
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,880
zero one zero one zero zero

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,080
one zero

162
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,280
zero zero one one okay this is adjacent

163
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,120
what does it mean

164
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,600
look at this diagonal is always one

165
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,520
because the standard you can say this is

166
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,639
a b c d and then this is a b c d

167
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,919
if a and b is connected you put a one

168
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,120
here right

169
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,039
if a and b is not connected uh look c

170
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,520
and a is not connected equal to zero

171
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,319
right so you basically look it up

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,560
right so if there are n vertex here so

173
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,360
these space complexities oh n square

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,039
right

175
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,120
yeah look you just look it up for

176
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,600
example d to

177
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,240
d to speed c is one okay can you explain

178
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,479
to me why this this diagonal is one

179
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,720
it's always one

180
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,759
because um there's

181
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,759
this

182
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,759
there's a um

183
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,520
diagonal it's like a a like bb yes

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,960
so it's excel right it doesn't matter

185
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,880
actually you can put zero it doesn't

186
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,440
matter because it just means that the

187
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,759
note is is you know it's a node itself

188
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,639
it does not it does not represent

189
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,720
a edge between two vertex right it's a

190
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,440
it's basically a vertex

191
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,960
b to d right you look it up b to b so

192
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:21,360
look if this metric is mirroring by the

193
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,360
time what does it mean if it's mirroring

194
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,000
the mirroring you know mirroring what if

195
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,400
it's mirror if this is zero and then

196
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,400
diagonal here it's all this is also zero

197
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,720
if this is one this is also one what

198
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,840
does it mean

199
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,639
think about it what does it mean

200
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,800
[Music]

201
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,960
yeah it's undirected right if it's

202
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,120
directed if you look a to c but c

203
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,039
there's no point to a so a to c could be

204
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,199
a to c here is one c to a here

205
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,599
and zero right okay we're done no that's

206
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,560
a good job let's adjacent match adjacent

207
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,759
list

208
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,840
okay so so okay so now we want to visit

209
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,840
the

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,039
the preference search okay professor

211
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,319
define whether search

212
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,759
source

213
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,599
which is q

214
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,319
q equals dq here remember we use the dq

215
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,960
pull the source in and then we have uh

216
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:21,440
scene equals set by the way what's the

217
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,400
advantage of using dq instead of list

218
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,599
because

219
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,960
because

220
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,639
if you're gonna look up in the list

221
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,759
and

222
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,479
in the list it takes a long time to look

223
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,719
up

224
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,959
and but for this cue we don't need to

225
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,959
look it up we need to do what um

226
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,240
a pen it's a one pop pop from the left

227
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,720
is o n right but for the dq is always

228
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,959
201 in both direction

229
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,480
so y and q

230
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,360
and then we can say say current equals q

231
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,040
dot pop left

232
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,800
and then we can just say for now in g

233
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,839
current

234
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:11,440
is not if n not

235
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:14,240
in and then we just queue the append

236
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,040
q dot append and right yeah

237
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,399
and then obviously we need to put it yes

238
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,680
n right this is the

239
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,920
this is the breakfast search right

240
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,920
there

241
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,800
q dq

242
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,880
sim y t or y cube and we'll put the

243
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,600
source in the queue we take

244
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,160
take the q we pop it from the left as

245
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,720
long as the queue is not empty and we

246
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,720
track we push this kit

247
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,680
if it's not being seen to the queue

248
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,640
right yeah look how simple is that right

249
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,640
okay so one question

250
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,240
if i change this queue to stack

251
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,240
step

252
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,880
good question that's a very good point

253
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,920
but i changed this to pop just pop

254
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:10,320
another stick first in that right yeah

255
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,320
so what will happen does it become a dfs

256
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,760
not really

257
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,519
no really okay yeah your answer is right

258
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,959
but let's let's look it so the default

259
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,959
search is one

260
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:25,200
a b e okay the difference search is

261
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,279
a b e d c right right yeah

262
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,760
but if we pop it if we're using the

263
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,560
stack so if i push it to the right so

264
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,360
let's

265
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,480
the ladies is the step yeah i put it a i

266
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,680
take it out

267
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,839
a and i put a b c b here d

268
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,079
c b right

269
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,160
the sequence is a okay i'm going to take

270
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,519
a br right

271
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,320
yeah

272
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,800
and then i need to put it what

273
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,440
put the e at e

274
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,920
i take the e

275
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,880
take an e you're just putting it and

276
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,279
then

277
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,200
getting it back

278
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,839
yeah yeah yeah look because i already

279
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,160
visited it's not be seen right this

280
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,640
scene equals a

281
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,480
i take it i i already visited it

282
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,240
equals a right

283
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
and

284
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,200
i pushed the kids bcd and bcp let's put

285
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,720
it in the reverse order i take it back

286
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,160
take it out

287
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,880
i take it off

288
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,040
i'm gonna push it to kit which is e

289
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,079
a already visited so i don't push it

290
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,480
okay i take an er

291
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,120
yeah and i push the kids which is d

292
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,120
already push it so

293
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,440
i already push it i don't take it right

294
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,760
so now i take a what's next

295
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,519
c right yeah

296
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,480
so c

297
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,680
uh

298
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,959
ap

299
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,200
okay so a p e c d

300
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,240
e c t block e c t

301
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,480
which is

302
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,800
which is different than a b e d c you

303
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,639
see the difference the temperature is a

304
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,000
b e d c but for if i change this b q

305
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,959
to a stack

306
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,880
yeah i emulate this for you the sequence

307
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,279
is a b e

308
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,160
c d it's different right it's not

309
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,639
so

310
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,760
so preference so first let's search if

311
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:17,120
we change the queue to step it's not

312
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,079
actually the same as definition

313
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
yeah

314
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,560
okay okay so this is just a sign note

315
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,079
okay um

316
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:30,480
one question the the depth of search

317
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,800
is guaranteed uh shortest path

318
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,079
you know the shortest if i want to visit

319
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,959
the shortest path between a

320
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,200
c

321
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,639
b this is the triangle i want to visit

322
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,360
the shortest path but i want to

323
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,600
calculate the shortest path from a to c

324
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,519
what's the shortest path and directly

325
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,200
okay let's talk about

326
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,120
what's the shortest path

327
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,120
atc yeah

328
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,160
yeah okay but for the tesla search it

329
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,519
might come this first a b c right once

330
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,519
you found the note it's not guaranteed

331
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,680
the optimum right

332
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,279
yeah it's not guaranteed it's like a

333
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,720
tree

334
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,890
a

335
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,320
b

336
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,760
[Music]

337
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,120
c

338
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,760
d

339
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,600
uh it's not optimal okay so

340
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,839
if i

341
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,040
i can do this e

342
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,880
f okay

343
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,560
g

344
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,320
okay and then i have at least another

345
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,399
edge okay l by i have another g

346
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,800
analogy here okay

347
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,200
so look if you do the test search

348
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,120
define the g i want to find the shutter

349
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,040
speed which is the entity you do the

350
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,959
definition you quickly find this but

351
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,000
it's not a shortage it's not a guarantee

352
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,880
right

353
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,399
okay

354
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,839
because there's a path here which is

355
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,199
shorter

356
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
make sense

357
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,760
so the test search does not guarantee

358
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,480
the shutter speed unless

359
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,680
unless you will visit all the paths from

360
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,240
a to every element yeah

361
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,639
blue forces because look if i exhorted

362
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,800
all the search to all other

363
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,959
nodes and i can come back get a minimum

364
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,279
right make sense but for the preference

365
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,959
search it's always guaranteed

366
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,399
again i'm talking about under rescue

367
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:18,560
graph okay the shortest path look a b e

368
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:21,120
c d f a h g okay i found it this t here

369
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,880
not here right makes sense

370
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,560
but there is a way

371
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,639
to change

372
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,199
okay this is the part of today there's a

373
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,959
way to change these

374
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,800
dfs to

375
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,600
breakfast search to to guarantee a

376
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,480
shortest path that's away

377
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,480
we are adding a

378
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,920
maximum depth

379
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,519
mass depth depth yeah limit oh we call

380
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,040
it that's named

381
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,360
that's name

382
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,199
what what does it mean look

383
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,959
okay let's travel with the maximum

384
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,880
distance one

385
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,959
the short the different search so what

386
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,480
does it give us

387
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,040
a a

388
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,360
okay this is like what's and okay let's

389
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,480
increase the deep depth to two what does

390
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,160
it give us

391
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,160
b and

392
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,240
e okay

393
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,480
okay we still haven't found the target

394
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,160
let's increase one more time the target

395
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,040
to three

396
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,519
yeah

397
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,600
yeah yes kind of like breakfast search

398
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,440
not really breakfast thirty is like

399
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,040
traveled knows by notes but now i'm

400
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,959
saying that i want to do the different

401
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,759
search with the maximum

402
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,800
distance up to three so i can do this a

403
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,600
b c

404
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,759
d e f it doesn't go any further once we

405
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,399
hit the next the distance we stop right

406
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,199
and then we can increase to that small

407
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,440
right that's right okay so in this way

408
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,839
we can find i find it is it faster or

409
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,839
slow

410
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,079
it's like the same as breakfast

411
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,399
not really we okay that's the difference

412
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,680
perfect search for each node here b is

413
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,720
visited once

414
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,639
but look

415
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,360
if i increase the test for differences

416
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,000
look one is the distance two i visit the

417
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,120
b when is instance three i visit the b

418
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,800
again a b c when i increase one more

419
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,720
test abcd you see i repeatedly go over

420
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,240
the test search again and again okay

421
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,440
make sense

422
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
so look at

423
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,040
so

424
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,320
the only difference we added for the

425
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,639
test search is to what def test

426
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,639
with no current but we have a maximum p

427
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,199
we added this so

428
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,240
so what is it what so what first of all

429
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,560
if

430
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,120
c u r in sin we still return yeah we

431
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,600
have visited it nobody can

432
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,600
and then we visited g uh sin

433
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,959
carbon uh cinder a current in the air

434
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,959
carbon

435
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,000
okay and then now i added this is one

436
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,839
more okay

437
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,360
if d

438
00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:00,160
uh okay so this d is the maximum uh

439
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,000
maximum d and we also need the current

440
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,440
the current d

441
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,640
currently

442
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,480
this d

443
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,160
is the maximum you can go this is the

444
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,760
current depth so look

445
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,720
if

446
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,120
d

447
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,000
bigger than d

448
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,640
that would be 10 yeah we can just return

449
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,199
because we have a current we are

450
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,959
limiting our search distance to maximum

451
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,600
three steps but now we are traveling too

452
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,160
fast so we stop and then this is the

453
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,360
other thing is the same for n in

454
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,960
g

455
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,880
c u r

456
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,799
right i know what should we do now we

457
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,760
travel t f s

458
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,160
and

459
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,840
this is t never change and i look at t

460
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,919
i need to do what

461
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,600
what what should i do with d

462
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,360
what should i do with the d like that if

463
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,760
i visit one more number what should i do

464
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,480
plus one plus one like that yeah first

465
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,760
one look this is only different

466
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,039
this is the only difference with the

467
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,600
normal theme

468
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,360
and then for the

469
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,400
follower

470
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,360
for the one

471
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,840
then we can say wire not found yeah

472
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,720
not file

473
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,360
the file at the beginning equals number

474
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,760
not file yeah now we can say look

475
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,440
definite search found include default

476
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,720
search

477
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
this t

478
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,799
uh

479
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,480
we can start with the source the d

480
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,480
d and then at the beginning is zero

481
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,360
right or one it doesn't matter and then

482
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,760
look

483
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,240
and what should we do we increment the d

484
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,000
plus equals one right

485
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,720
this is to increase

486
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,480
our deepening we call it in iterative

487
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,640
deepening

488
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,160
iterative

489
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,160
iterative deepening

490
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,559
differently means that

491
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,960
we perform the data search with the

492
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:51,520
depth depth d

493
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,360
and if we found it we we allowed it to

494
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,360
have one more

495
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,720
maximum distance right so we increase

496
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,720
the maximum d

497
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,600
one more right until we found it

498
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,880
so look as as we said the nodes

499
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,760
okay so the nodes with the depth a

500
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,799
and then the certain distance if it's d

501
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,160
it needs to be visited uh how many times

502
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,320
look

503
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,760
this is a okay this is b this is c this

504
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,960
is d

505
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,840
okay now if i want to travel from a to b

506
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,000
a to b is the shortest distance right so

507
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,480
this b how many times it needs to be

508
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,720
traveled how how many summit needs to

509
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,280
visit okay

510
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,400
a not visiting it b

511
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,840
a b

512
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,280
visited one time

513
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,000
a b c which is another times a b c d

514
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,919
music and another so look the the notes

515
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
needs to be visited some notes will be

516
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,120
visited one more time right so look at

517
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,160
this distance is one two three right

518
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,600
right and then this distance is

519
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,640
one so

520
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,880
so the the notes needs to be visited

521
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,320
three minus one plus one okay so look

522
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,520
this is d

523
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,039
this is a if this the distance is a and

524
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,799
uh how many times it needs to be

525
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,360
meditative is d minus a plus one okay

526
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,520
make sense yeah

527
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
so

528
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,000
it looks like okay we

529
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:26,080
we have repeatedly

530
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,960
visited no it might be slower right yeah

531
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,880
all right it might work but but there's

532
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,600
advantage of using this

533
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,600
uh iterated differently

534
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,360
look if a tree remember this binary tree

535
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,000
if it's a perfect

536
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,640
either yeah it's the perfect binary or

537
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,440
not perfect we call it what full binary

538
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,440
for banana tree

539
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:54,960
four by the tree every note every layer

540
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,480
every every note except the this note

541
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,960
this is the leaf number which all have

542
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,720
two notes two children right

543
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,080
yeah

544
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,000
look

545
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,840
if this d equals

546
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,840
the depth equals one two three

547
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,520
what's how many in these notes are there

548
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,080
how many how many

549
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,720
how many notes in depth equals three one

550
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,919
two three four five one two three four

551
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,919
yeah hey

552
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,400
so it's eight actually two to the power

553
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,360
of n right yeah

554
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,559
okay so for the transfer search

555
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,559
we need to

556
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,640
the space complexity look we're talking

557
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,320
about space mode basically needs to

558
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,200
store all these

559
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,720
right

560
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,960
yeah

561
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,440
all right so the space complexity is

562
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,799
exponential for preferences because we

563
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,039
are expanding all the nodes

564
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,200
all the notes right could be exponential

565
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,440
i'm talking about the four binary

566
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,200
yeah follow deepening

567
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,559
for the deepening it's already different

568
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,960
i don't need to store all these notes

569
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,400
right i just need to store the depth

570
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,000
yeah yeah

571
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,200
so let's say

572
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,600
so

573
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,480
it's the space complexity is less than

574
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,640
this

575
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,720
like look i just spread i just need to

576
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,600
use the stack to store

577
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,440
once the path right yeah i don't need to

578
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,720
store any other thing right

579
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,559
yeah

580
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,080
makes sense

581
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,080
yeah any questions so far

582
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,240
really

583
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,080
okay so

584
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,120
okay answer me what's the advantage of

585
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,320
iterating differently and breakfast such

586
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,360
which one but because for the breakfast

587
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,159
search

588
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,919
um

589
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,640
you can okay

590
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:41,640
so if okay so go like oh yes oh yeah i'm

591
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,640
here

592
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,280
exponential right yeah

593
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,799
okay you'll become bigger bigger bigger

594
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,799
always double

595
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,799
yeah yeah

596
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,200
every time i try one more step okay

597
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,480
let's see if i can visit i can find this

598
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,360
note with the

599
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,919
maximum distance one that's like that i

600
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,360
can't then i increase the step too

601
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,679
i can't

602
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,159
step three so i don't for the test

603
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,159
research i don't actually need to store

604
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,400
all the nodes for the same level right i

605
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,280
don't need to keep a user q

606
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,120
the only the space i need to use for the

607
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,720
depth search is stack

608
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,600
which stores what the path is this piece

609
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,919
right

610
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,679
yeah oh n right

611
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,640
yeah

612
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,280
o n this is o n and this is o to n right

613
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,840
so the space it's already depending is

614
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,000
faster than than

615
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,039
normal speed i'm talking about the space

616
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,360
space safety a space is used

617
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,919
space used by the devil search is less

618
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,320
than a professor in terms of you know in

619
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,159
some class right and for you you know

620
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,720
for some uh complex algorithm like uh

621
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,720
uh meme max 3 or you know play chess

622
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,679
yeah you know the chess

623
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,360
i play one i want to get a chest usually

624
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,760
two players

625
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,640
yeah you know it's like i i you play a

626
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:14,000
chess i i take one i move one step you

627
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,919
move one step so look i want to

628
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,520
maximize the score like a hundred and

629
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,440
then you want to minimize the score

630
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,200
right so that's

631
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,960
yeah you take one step and then

632
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,080
i i take the mac

633
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
folders

634
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,039
up

635
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,039
layer i want to maximize for the even

636
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,760
layer you want to minimize

637
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,200
huh yeah because each one take a turn

638
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,120
right

639
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,279
and then for this in this kind of

640
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,279
chess playing algorithm usually we use

641
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,679
iterated deepening

642
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,039
to allow us caching some

643
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,480
you know some

644
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,000
states

645
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,440
so it's actually

646
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,120
not

647
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,960
it's actually faster than breakfast

648
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,960
search okay in some cases okay

649
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,520
it might be a bit too complicated but

650
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,400
okay what's your most important takeaway

651
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,039
today

652
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,480
i talked about a few things about

653
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,720
the different

654
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,640
research and what's the new concept we

655
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,039
are talking about

656
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,039
what is the d what's this

657
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,039
is

658
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,520
so okay so what's this bit the last

659
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,159
question what should this be

660
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:26,480
if d is b

661
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,640
if like like um like if we um okay we

662
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,640
are

663
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,039
and like this part is saying this and if

664
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,760
um

665
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,760
if not we visit the next one using the

666
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,919
kosher definite search but why why is

667
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,720
this the plus one here what's the person

668
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,559
d plus one is uh

669
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,559
um what's d

670
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,080
d is the

671
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,120
kind of

672
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,880
deepening thing what's the

673
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,720
tis

674
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,559
turns distance

675
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,880
it's a distance i visit one more node

676
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,640
the distance will be plus one and then i

677
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,200
check if the distance it sees the

678
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,440
structure max vector if it sees when i

679
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,360
stop don't go further right

680
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,760
okay so for this one is it already

681
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,919
depending uh let's say

682
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,039
i want to visit a to use

683
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,840
hey look the different search right abc

684
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:40,159
ac is normal uh optimum but if i say

685
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,120
okay let's visit a with the step one

686
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,919
a b

687
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,240
a c okay i busiest because from here b i

688
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,679
don't continue because it sees the

689
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,159
sensor right

690
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,559
so look the pure devil search does not

691
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,159
guarantee a shortest path because ac is

692
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,960
the shortest flight if you do the pure

693
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,600
depth research you will go from abc

694
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,720
this is not the optimum but if i edit

695
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,159
the

696
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,000
depth

697
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,200
and then at the beginning let's start

698
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,080
with one note

699
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,000
a b ac i found it right because a b i

700
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,440
can't continue why is that

701
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,279
because it sees one right this is the

702
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,720
distant one if i go here that will be

703
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,679
distance two

704
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,520
right

705
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,320
and i will be returned here it doesn't

706
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,000
go continue look make sense

707
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,039
okay that's it for today good job bye

708
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,080
bye

709
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,960
bye

710
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,960
bye bye
