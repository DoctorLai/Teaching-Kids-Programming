1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,679
hello hello

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,520
hello mr riviera here remember we talked

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,080
about the longest furniture substring

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,760
yesterday yeah so let's review this a

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,639
little bit here so

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,320
this is o o n o n square

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,480
the key thing of yesterday is what these

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
this paragon check is our end time right

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,119
so if we put all these together like

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
which which is a very basic you know

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,880
naive blue first

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,439
and then we'll take o and cubic because

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,840
this is very expensive to check

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,120
you know this is look it's

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,200
it happens

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,360
every time we want to find out if a

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,280
substring is a paragraph and that that

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,399
takes a long time that's very expensive

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,239
so how do we improve it we we can use

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,680
the dynamic programming dynamic

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,800
programming which this is dynamic

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,079
programming

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,360
equation

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,640
yeah to

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,640
to find out to compute to compute any

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,360
substring to see if it's a paragraph

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,120
right so we are reusing those f i j

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,559
representing

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,439
if the substring from i index j index

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,520
included is the parent term and then

31
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,280
for for each each substring we are not

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
calculating every time we are

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,640
calculating you know like the whole

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,439
stream

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,360
instead we use the fi plus one and j

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,360
minus nine so this is kind of we use in

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,439
the previous result which is bring down

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,240
the complexity from o and q because

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,320
right so and we can also implement this

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,840
using top down dynamic which is a

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,479
recursion with minimization with cash t1

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
yeah yeah so that's o and cubic that's

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,759
the

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,759
that's a way for us to find out the

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,000
longest tension substitute in o and

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,479
cubic o and square time right so this is

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,200
o n squared this is all n squared 2 o n

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,399
squared is 2 times of n squared

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,159
which is

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,759
o n squared because when we talk about

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,000
the time complexity

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,640
on all space complexity we drop the

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,240
constant right look at it

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
okay so now

55
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,320
today actually we have uh

56
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,799
another egg when yeah we have another

57
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,479
rhythm how many uh pending drums can you

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,680
categorize

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,000
i mean

60
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,759
how many cat uh peninsula what's the

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,920
pattern's about it by the way

62
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,920
uh when you reverse it it's still the

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,280
same can you give me an example

64
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,599
aba race car and then everybody yeah

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,000
yeah yeah poo p-o-p right

66
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,000
no two okay

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,599
if this is s in python we use this

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
syntax s

69
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,080
minus one equal equal s y count oh we

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,519
use the two points i think yeah two

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,840
points the counter

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,640
what counter no no the counter doesn't

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,120
have this case but like the two pointer

74
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,040
thing so look i and j

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,959
it's the same

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,959
i oh i know it's the same okay when i

77
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,879
meat it's a parent all right and if this

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319
is not a person like

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,120
uh

80
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,000
like

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,159
uh let's say uh d okay

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,440
the same

83
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,360
okay the same

84
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,760
but if i change this to okay not the

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,879
same no apparently okay two-pointed

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,519
thing easy

87
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,879
okay so so how let's come coming back to

88
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,640
the question how many kinds of

89
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,599
transgender how many kinds of vendors

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,239
how many how many kinds of pairs yeah

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,120
what are they old and

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,560
yeah

93
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,840
odd number

94
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,720
on what characters or even characters so

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,560
for example all characters a b a

96
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,000
okay even number

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
a a

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,040
uh

99
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,040
abba yeah you see

100
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,920
so you see the difference

101
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,080
yeah with the odd number or characters

102
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
the one in the middle right the one in

103
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,959
the middle

104
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,640
yeah it's just you know could be any

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,440
right it's a it's a single single one

106
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,760
right

107
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,879
for the even and everyone every

108
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,439
character has to be has to match another

109
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,280
one on the other side right okay

110
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:00,080
so so let's look at this a b b

111
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,080
b a

112
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,120
maybe

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,920
c's

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,840
okay what's the longest paradigm here

115
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,840
a b b b a yeah exactly so

116
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,799
c a b yeah okay let's look at this

117
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,120
example yeah

118
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,079
so if we can treat it we can go through

119
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,440
this a yeah we can use it as a center to

120
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,080
expand right

121
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,919
okay it doesn't go any b

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
i can explain no

123
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,960
b

124
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,280
look the thing is that if i use two

125
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,639
pointer i can expand this i i can use

126
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,080
these

127
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,240
as a center which doesn't give any more

128
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,800
uh any parent drum other than this b

129
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,199
right if i can use these two

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,000
right and that's two right the same b

131
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,720
so if i use this as a center then i can

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,240
explain look if i try to use this b

133
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,040
okay and then i can go both ways b okay

134
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,040
yeah okay so the longest turning joint

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,400
is character is

136
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:07,280
yeah five okay got it the same as look

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,479
the similar thing yeah uh a a b b c c

138
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,560
okay another one so look if i'm if i

139
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,720
have two two uh

140
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,440
pointer i and j here right

141
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,479
another time i can go i can let the

142
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,680
pointer go both ways uh go two ways yes

143
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,840
so b

144
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,160
c

145
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,320
right yeah you get my point

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,000
yeah so let's say we have explained

147
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,880
function it's uh expand to expand

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,120
it's back expand yeah it's fine

149
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,960
expand and then take two parameters i

150
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,960
and j so i and j means the center the

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,360
center of the paragraph we're looking to

152
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,440
expand okay so it could be

153
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,880
i and i means that

154
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,680
it's an odd number paragraph or

155
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,360
i

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,560
i plus one

157
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,440
which is okay so even okay so i i which

158
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,560
why this is the odd number

159
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,960
and why this is even number anybody

160
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,280
because i

161
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,360
the center if it's ii the index the

162
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,000
center is the one character it should be

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,800
even it will be all right the center is

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,080
two character and then so it will be odd

165
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,520
but then you plus one to make it even

166
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,319
which one you're talking about the

167
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,560
bottom the bottom one the center will be

168
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,600
two characters neighbor

169
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,360
that always will be even right okay

170
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,960
you're talking about the first one

171
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,560
so the center if it's a one finger

172
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,520
character and then you expand you go

173
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,600
back you let the pointer go the uh the

174
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,759
opposite direction right go over to the

175
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,400
right and then i'll be uh

176
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,800
odd number right so

177
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,600
so we can use this experiment and then

178
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,599
to remember the longest distance that

179
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,360
both pointers can travel

180
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,120
right if we remember the longest

181
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,000
distance they can travel then we find

182
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,319
the longest challenger make sense

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,080
does it make sense am i right

184
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,440
these two pointer and

185
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,000
yeah so

186
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,560
every time i start checking i i have two

187
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,720
choice i start checking the

188
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,639
the palindrome by expanding around the

189
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,319
center so it could be two right it could

190
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,639
be even or it could be odd

191
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,880
when it's when it's odd

192
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,120
the center is one single character when

193
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,440
it's even it's two characters and then

194
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,360
like that two pointers go

195
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,520
you know they separate the opposite

196
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,080
direction and then let's see how far it

197
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,680
can go how far you can travel right and

198
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,160
then you stop

199
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,720
and you stop and then we can we can see

200
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,479
how far the distance is that's the

201
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,000
length of the longest

202
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,479
that's the long length of the longest

203
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,039
pendulum okay basically that's how we

204
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,280
use these expensive around center things

205
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,240
so we just quickly write this okay let's

206
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,919
see

207
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,879
so

208
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,800
n equals length s okay let us define

209
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,639
this expand define

210
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,280
expand

211
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,280
the center

212
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,879
is bigger or equal than zero and

213
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,960
r is smaller than n right so look these

214
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,840
two pointers cannot that cannot go

215
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,599
beyond the boundary i'm right yeah

216
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,520
and

217
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,039
s i

218
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,080
s l equal equal s j s r okay

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,039
so

220
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,360
look alright ryan come on this center

221
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,440
when they when they're the characters at

222
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
these two points and match the air goes

223
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,640
to which way ah

224
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,440
sorry

225
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,839
look this is air this is ah

226
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,680
okay there suppose this is center okay

227
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,839
and the point that the characters are

228
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,160
the same like a a and then which

229
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,360
category l what's your air move what's

230
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,200
your one

231
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,480
yeah s move this way actually move this

232
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
way right

233
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,440
exactly and if it's a single character a

234
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,120
and

235
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,560
it goes this way and this way right

236
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,440
exactly so air minus equals one and ah

237
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,720
one

238
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
hour

239
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,959
easy

240
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,519
plus equals one plus equals one okay and

241
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,600
then return we want to return we can

242
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,399
because when it when the break

243
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,480
when the loop terminates right it point

244
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,640
the l and r points to an embedded

245
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,440
position so we need to return its

246
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,880
previous state which is a plus one

247
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,360
and an r minus one right you see

248
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,399
everybody okay let me repeat this

249
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
when the

250
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,880
y

251
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,120
terminates

252
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,120
the air and r pointer points to the

253
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,240
invalid state which is could be smaller

254
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,880
than zero of outer boundary or s air not

255
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,360
equal hr right this is basically

256
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,959
embedded or embedded

257
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,880
for alternative so that's why we

258
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,880
returned it previously which is air plus

259
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,600
one and normalized okay with that in

260
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,880
mind so with air at the beginning l

261
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,920
equals

262
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,800
maybe

263
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,279
you know

264
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,320
minus one

265
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,600
m l equals zero r means minus one okay

266
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,320
we just said that

267
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,680
look at the beginning air

268
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,600
is

269
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,920
l is zero

270
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,000
i is minus one okay so this is opposite

271
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,600
why we we need that because in this case

272
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,200
we the

273
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,240
the length will be r minus l which is

274
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,800
minus one right right so the minimum the

275
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,040
minimum parameter length would be one

276
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,440
one character right yeah so we said we

277
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,760
need to choose this uh initial

278
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,120
uh states carefully okay then we can go

279
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,320
through these four

280
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,880
i in range

281
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,120
range n right so now

282
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,279
uh a b equals expand

283
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,440
it expand i i x

284
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,720
right and i will check if

285
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,040
b minus a bigger than r

286
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,640
minus a then we remember

287
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,519
air r equals a b okay and then another

288
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,200
choice okay look this is for the odd

289
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
number of characters

290
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,480
and what's the second choice what's the

291
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,800
other possibilities

292
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,200
even so i i should push i and what

293
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:12,079
what's the second parameters

294
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,480
if it's even a b equals expand

295
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,000
i what's the second meter anybody and

296
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,839
then this is the same i copy again

297
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,399
here

298
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,440
i i sing character and if it's two

299
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,079
characters

300
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,720
what parameter should i use

301
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,279
i what's its next characters

302
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,959
exactly so this is i plus one okay and

303
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,360
then we copy this we need to check it

304
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,560
look because this function returns the

305
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,720
longest

306
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,880
the parent drum yeah the parentheses of

307
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,680
the left boundary and right boundary and

308
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,279
then b minus a means that

309
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,000
the length and roughly the length

310
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,800
actually plus one but in this case you

311
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,959
have uh we can pass one in both cases so

312
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,519
we don't need to plus one here

313
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,920
b minus a bigger than uh this is the

314
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,399
correct this is the existing

315
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,560
existing the longest pairing drum

316
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,639
substring right if we find a better one

317
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,880
then we remember the left and right

318
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,079
boundary right you get it and then we

319
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,079
return one and then at the end we do ten

320
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,079
return s

321
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,360
air

322
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,200
to r plus one right

323
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,440
yeah

324
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,440
it's easy to implement yeah yesterday we

325
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,360
talked about the brute force and we

326
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,760
optimize it by dynamic programming right

327
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,760
and then the code you have to write lots

328
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,240
of code right but for this one and not

329
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,839
not much code to write right

330
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,560
yeah okay let me repeat this one more

331
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,200
time okay so how does that work look

332
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,120
uh let's try another example okay

333
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,440
e r i c a a

334
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,120
c b

335
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,000
e x okay what's the longest parameter

336
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,120
c

337
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,120
a a okay

338
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,760
yeah so i try i i

339
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,040
okay and i also try i i and i plus one

340
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,440
okay so if i try to i and i plus one and

341
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,360
here i go both ways go both way

342
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,839
okay so that character is four four

343
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,800
characters apparently you get it

344
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,360
yeah

345
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,440
okay then if i have another one this is

346
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,920
uh b a

347
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,240
so then in this case like we try the

348
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,200
middle one i and i

349
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,920
we explain around the center b

350
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,279
a

351
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,279
c

352
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,839
yeah this this is basically what expand

353
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,320
function too yeah b a c

354
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,279
and then we turn the left boundary which

355
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,320
is here this is left this is right

356
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,240
right and the lens will be r minus l

357
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,519
plus one to get it

358
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
yeah and that's what it's doing here

359
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,120
look at this okay one more question last

360
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,519
question what's this

361
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,880
what's big why this is this i i and why

362
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,440
they sign i plus one come on because i

363
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,560
must be the same because if you have

364
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,000
someone a b a the center is if you want

365
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,000
so oh yeah yeah yeah

366
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:11,170
[Laughter]

367
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,480
middle is about

368
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,399
yeah yeah okay and what's this x-men

369
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,560
function doing

370
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,639
uh it's just open in the car

371
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,519
okay so look it influences look at the

372
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,519
uh

373
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,560
okay i want this one

374
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,720
c

375
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720
b

376
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,120
d

377
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
a c p

378
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,880
a

379
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,320
x y okay so if i look if i is here

380
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,839
i i okay

381
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,360
so expand

382
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,600
so what's the

383
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,160
so look it points them to the meter

384
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,680
abcba yeah

385
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,440
so after the expand what does it return

386
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,040
what does it return where is the air

387
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,480
with r

388
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,720
you know if the s is y a b c b x

389
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,160
and an air r points to c

390
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,160
where's the air

391
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,160
is

392
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,480
we're done that's it for today bye bye

393
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,040
bye bye bye oh one more thing the time

394
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,040
come next t

395
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,560
we go look this is n character we go

396
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,680
through this

397
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,839
that's n

398
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,920
and for each one we need to

399
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,079
expand that takes n so what's the time

400
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,000
complexity look

401
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,680
this is n

402
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,440
o n square this is o s o n square yes or

403
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,240
n square okay that's it for today bye

404
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,920
bye

405
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,920
bye good job bye bye
