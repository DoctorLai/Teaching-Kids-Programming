1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,780
hello hello

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,080
okay so we're giving this number integer

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,240
positive integer uh

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,820
and we want to find out

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,600
why am I right we want to find out if we

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:22,859
can find any non-negative integers

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,960
let the sum of it and its reverse equals

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,359
the N for example like if we're given it

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,820
for three and a search number one seven

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,600
two which is non-negative and it's

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:37,260
reverse it's revised 271 plus a together

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,239
equals 400. 140 the reverse zero four

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,960
one okay we can have leaving zero so

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,260
plus it together equals 181 okay 63 we

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,940
don't find such integer like

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,680
non-negative integer plus it's reverse

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,260
yes

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,700
can the original number yeah have a

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,160
leading theorem

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,820
the original right you mean this one

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,399
I mean I mean this number like this yeah

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,040
yeah of course don't look

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,260
look zero four one this is the same as

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,080
zero four one plus one forty five

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,299
oh yeah yeah so we're given this end we

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,420
want to find out if they are a plus b

27
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,820
right equals n okay I'm not asking you

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,180
to find out the which number right I'm

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,720
just asking if there's such integer and

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,119
it's reverse okay make sense and then we

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,420
could have a leaving zero so A and B so

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,060
a this is the reverse of B okay reverse

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,600
the integer reverse so this comes with

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,240
impairs does it make sense

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,439
okay so what's the first solution coming

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,540
to my

37
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,420
if we were given this n and we want to

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,100
find out if they are long negative

39
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,380
negative

40
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,640
yeah non-negative A and B plus together

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,960
is is n and a and b needs to be uh

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,240
reverse is a symmetric right symmetric

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,119
how do you spell symmetric

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,180
symmetric right what's symmetric

45
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,060
both sides are the same exactly the same

46
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,599
symmetrical but that's not symmetrical

47
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,930
well this is symmetrical no it's not uh

48
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm trying to okay symmetrical

49
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,700
[Music]

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,640
because on one on the right it's a

51
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,440
wobbly one but one other left but your

52
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,260
left hand and right hand symmetrical

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,980
okay no they're not what is that

54
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,500
I remember uh so basically it means that

55
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,640
kind of mean all right no they're not

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,860
no my left hand is doubled my family the

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,920
double jointed by my other one okay okay

58
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,160
I know sorry this one is cleaner than

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,140
this one okay okay yeah yeah forget

60
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,599
about the details but I'm just saying

61
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,180
that you understand

62
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,400
teacher before I go my Vine teacher

63
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,280
right now

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,340
her pinky is he is low her right one

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,700
pinky is longer than her left pinky okay

66
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,860
now let's uh focus on this uh problem so

67
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,540
what's your solution what's uh what's

68
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,480
the thing in your mind so you've given

69
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,040
this end so what we can do

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,080
what we can do

71
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,700
so how many possibilities we can check

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,900
what is the solution that we have to

73
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,900
check each possibilities

74
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,420
stupid way right given this 443 how many

75
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,519
possibilities we have to check we check

76
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,159
from zero okay two four four three so

77
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,680
they are four four four numbers to check

78
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,560
what I'm saying they were given n so we

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,739
just need to check from 0 to n inclusive

80
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,739
right

81
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,140
of course the N could be anything

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,620
so but the thing is that we have to

83
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:59,400
check out to end right for I in range

84
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:02,099
from 0 to n right to n plus one

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:08,040
and now we just have to check if I plus

86
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:11,099
it's reverse I equal equal n right

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,379
and then we do 10 true

88
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:17,160
otherwise return false all right this is

89
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:20,880
the proof of 310 we can write it using

90
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,019
any return any I plus reverse I equal

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,860
equal n

92
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,780
for I in range and plus one right and

93
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,940
this reverse function let's write it how

94
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,620
do we reverse this one if we say one two

95
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,979
three how do we get the three to one

96
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,000
[Music]

97
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:37,680
which we round

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,040
we just switch it around

99
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,380
we can there are two ways

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,120
one way is that if we convert it to

101
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,860
string right

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,419
if we convert it to string that will

103
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,280
become one two three how do we reverse

104
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,740
this bit

105
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,020
three two one yeah how do we make three

106
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,880
to one we use the okay what's this

107
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,880
latest column column

108
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,600
but this is the string now we need to

109
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,580
convert it back to integer right so we

110
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,340
just put it integer

111
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,419
okay this is one way another way one two

112
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,419
three how do we get a three

113
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,080
we talked about that

114
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,060
modulus 10 right and then we get rid of

115
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,880
three by divided by ten right and then

116
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,600
we keep doing this right extract the

117
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,699
rightmost digit we extract the ones and

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,699
then we remove it

119
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,800
okay so one two three four we extract

120
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:44,400
the first Stitch four

121
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,539
we extract the three so where do we put

122
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,460
the three

123
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:51,300
and now I'm taking three out what should

124
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,280
I put it right yes okay now I'm taking

125
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,560
two where should I put it

126
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,419
right and I'm taking one where's here

127
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,039
today

128
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,919
yeah you see

129
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,440
Define reverse and

130
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,020
we want to reverse this individual the

131
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,220
answer would be answer at the beginning

132
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:13,979
of this yellow wire n is bigger than

133
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,020
zero right then we take the last digit

134
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:20,699
so the last digit will be

135
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:22,460
x y x equals n more details 10. this is

136
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:26,759
four right and then

137
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:30,960
answer equals answer answer times 10

138
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:33,600
plus X then n divided equal to 10 return

139
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,120
answer I want to put a 1 on the right so

140
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,419
I need to multiply this by 10 right so

141
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:43,259
it becomes 4 3 to 0 and then plus one

142
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:46,860
make sense look I take the one the digit

143
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:49,139
and one here I multiply 10 means that I

144
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,460
put a 0 on the right hand side

145
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:55,500
and then plus X right from the X here

146
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:59,400
and then the original number needs to be

147
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:02,280
taking out the one digit so we divide by

148
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,460
10 okay this is the three four solution

149
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,520
so do we have to check every number no

150
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:12,180
why so for example like four first three

151
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:16,020
so we have to check from 0 to 443 can we

152
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,300
do better than this how

153
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,539
look we are looking for two numbers A

154
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,259
and B symmetric but add it together to

155
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:28,380
443 so do we have to check every number

156
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,120
for a true false all the possibilities

157
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,720
of a right

158
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,319
so I'm saying A and B are symmetric so

159
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,759
one seven two two seven one is metric

160
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,099
right

161
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,160
symmetrical okay so these two numbers

162
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:46,020
are symmetrical so does it matter that

163
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,520
which one is which

164
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:52,259
it doesn't matter right they're not

165
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,180
symmetrical that seventh line is one

166
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,699
seven two one seven two I mean reverse

167
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,440
t-shirt okay there's symmetrical okay no

168
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:01,800
that one has been rubbed out a little

169
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,440
bit okay symmetrical is like adapters

170
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,660
not opposite

171
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:11,099
symmetrical is like a mirror yeah so if

172
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:15,080
I did one seven two it'll be like this

173
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:18,000
one seven ah okay okay okay okay

174
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,759
that's the confusion here but the one on

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,039
the right side is the two is slightly

176
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,680
okay let's forget about this uh what I'm

177
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,419
saying the 172 and two seven one this is

178
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,020
symmetrical okay forget about the shit

179
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:32,339
okay no no no it's not symmetrical it's

180
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,800
reverse

181
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:38,760
ah okay that makes no sense okay but

182
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,520
what I'm saying is that this AMD can be

183
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,919
interchangeable all right so do we

184
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,560
actually have to go through this

185
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,260
can we just do half that's what I meant

186
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,080
we checked from The Middle

187
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,120
does it make sense yeah because we only

188
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,459
have to check half of it and the other

189
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,820
one we just use the mess does it make

190
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:02,640
sense okay so which is which half the

191
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,380
first half from zero to that meter or

192
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,940
the meter to them this is the one

193
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,519
question for you

194
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,800
okay you're listening yeah I am

195
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,360
listening okay so from what's the half

196
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,120
of forward three

197
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,720
spider

198
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:21,240
it is uh two two let's say two two one

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,060
or two one or two to one point five okay

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,279
do we check numbers from zero to two to

201
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,500
one or from two to one two four four

202
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,360
three we check this number so we go

203
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,519
through this number and then we reverse

204
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,560
it and we add it together to see if it

205
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,519
adds about two four three which one do

206
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,760
you think it's better left left one

207
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,760
because it

208
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,560
it's obviously going to be bigger

209
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,360
now let's have a tricky one because

210
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,779
because

211
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,660
well either way I think it's I think

212
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:56,519
they're the same way but are you sure

213
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,920
how about I give you a hint leading

214
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,480
zeros which part does not consider the

215
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,700
leading zeros

216
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,700
to the right

217
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,700
left heart does not consider leaving his

218
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,860
wife because like zero one two three in

219
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,580
Reverse list you never get leading zero

220
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,580
am I right

221
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,899
the social

222
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:26,240
yeah so for example like you you because

223
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:26,240
here no no what I'm saying

224
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,420
what if you do 180 yeah

225
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:41,420
yeah that's true what I meant is that uh

226
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,420
look this is yellow one knife we don't

227
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,160
zero right so we instead we check from

228
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,220
this side we check from this side

229
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,220
because when we eat away over this range

230
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,600
right we are missing we're missing this

231
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,220
for example if it's three digit we're

232
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,560
missing this is yellow here

233
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,220
all right yeah so we're going to reverse

234
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,800
this 19 will become a 91.

235
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,920
if we reverse if we check the integer

236
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,540
from 9 1 0 and then it reverse will be

237
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,600
0.19 okay so we're gonna be leaving zero

238
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,760
in this case make sense

239
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,260
so the Improvement is that we start from

240
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,880
the middle middle and this so we start

241
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,180
from a meters integer and now we close

242
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,740
to all the half numbers and then we

243
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,420
check its reverse

244
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,240
and then we add it together and we

245
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,339
change if it's a 443 if it's a given and

246
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,500
if it is then we return to otherwise

247
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:34,320
written Force the time come next to each

248
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:38,160
layer n right so this is all

249
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,399
divided by half right times

250
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,279
the reverse function takes o

251
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,980
takes Ln right let's say m m is the

252
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,839
digit right one two three so it needs

253
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,160
the three iterations to get to the

254
00:11:48,839 --> 00:12:02,600
digits so m is roughly log base 10

255
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:02,600
uh n y so it's o n Times log 10 Place n

256
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,760
over 2 is the same as n when we talk

257
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,740
about time complexity because this 2 is

258
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,480
the constant we drop the constant okay

259
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,820
make sense

260
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,700
layer better approach like mathematics

261
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,279
and also binary search which are too

262
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,320
complicated for you okay so we're not

263
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,660
going to talk about that today okay so

264
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,899
what have you learned today

265
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:31,380
and we learned about the calculation

266
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:34,800
over like reversity numbers added so we

267
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:38,700
have a number and and we want to we want

268
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:43,620
the sum to add up to that so we have

269
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:47,040
reversed so so we have it so we like

270
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,300
so we try to see if there's a possible

271
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,100
to

272
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:54,120
possible to like

273
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,160
um uh reverse for numbers and add were

274
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,620
some together

275
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,779
okay we just use the profiles yeah so

276
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,220
the key thing to take away is that we

277
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,100
start from the half

278
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,940
from meter to the to end

279
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,459
just to iterate half of the numbers

280
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,620
and then you know how to reverse a

281
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,540
number how many ways we can reverse a

282
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:20,100
number

283
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:22,200
so okay can you just say one of it

284
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,000
yeah we convert to a string we use the

285
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,920
column column minus one to reverse the

286
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,779
string and then we need to convert it

287
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,980
back using the in function okay let's

288
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,980
see for today bye bye
