1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,379
what's this I'm trying to go die okay so

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:11,360
duh what's that area of China how do you

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,360
calculate the area of triangle

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,039
huh sorry so you pretended the rectangle

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,680
and then you turn the lamp by the width

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,039
and then and then plant those together

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,800
and then divide it okay okay so okay so

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,140
let's take a look at these rectangles

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,220
rectangle if this is a this is B what's

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,220
the size what's the area

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:44,760
you know if we move this here

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:48,739
like move it here

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,739
so does the area change

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,940
what's the size of this so what did I do

15
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,860
because yeah because you're just cutting

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,340
off

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:05,880
the area is like like the area or like

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,619
how like the okay so you know like

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,540
shrinking something and then putting

20
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,460
something you're moving the same thing

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,820
like yeah look at what I did I move

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,920
right so this one no no you're not yeah

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,040
you're not it's Landing yet

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,780
um yeah you're just cutting off this bit

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,900
and moving it yeah yeah that's what I'm

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,479
saying it's not changing that you move

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,040
it like that

28
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,200
oh okay yeah there's a slight difference

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,479
yes yes because if you move like that

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,740
then these will you know move down right

31
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,780
yeah but I'm saying this this will hide

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,640
is not changing so it basically is just

33
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,979
cutting so let's like every does not

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,680
change that's a good observation so if

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,799
this is a what's the size of triangle

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,280
uh eight times eight times B divided by

37
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,159
two what's a was B the length I'm always

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,420
the lens so okay so look yeah what's

39
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,700
this

40
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,579
all you can do

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,040
or you can do it anyway I see okay so

42
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,759
okay so look at this one right so if

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,979
this is a this is B right yeah this is a

44
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,800
look at this is basically it's half of

45
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,560
these so what's the shape of this

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,760
what do you call this parallelogram

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,160
Paragon parallelogram parallelogram it

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,000
has two sides of uh which are parallel

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,000
okay okay

50
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:33,000
uh like a word

51
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,300
okay so yeah you know right so it's

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,239
basically the side of one side plus its

53
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,239
height h y so is half of 8 times

54
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,720
I'm saying a times B divided by two and

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,080
you're saying equals a what's B

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,440
yeah that's how we get it from here

57
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,300
you're saying like the height

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,220
but I'm saying will then come with it so

59
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,200
your comes only is the rectangle right

60
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,720
rectangle square is a rectangle right

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,940
and then we kind of cut in a little bit

62
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,140
parallelogram for parallelogram where

63
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,879
you can cut it in half then it's

64
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,860
triangle right that's how we get it okay

65
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:16,680
yeah okay so that's the basic okay right

66
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:20,220
here like you're doing

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,680
you're doing like like this yeah for an

68
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,379
equilateral triangle you make it a

69
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,959
parallelogram and and then that makes it

70
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:31,200
um a quadrilateral yeah but if you have

71
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,620
a right angle you can you make it a

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,920
square uh yeah yeah any arbitrary

73
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,540
triangle yeah we can fight any point any

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,879
point here and if I'm telling you the

75
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,340
size of this is four this is two this is

76
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,319
three and the question is what's the

77
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,599
size of this

78
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,120
so by the way for given arbitrary

79
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,640
triangle ABC we have a formula to

80
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,200
calculate the area right but we're going

81
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,560
to talk about that maybe in the future

82
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,840
okay it's three full to the area yeah

83
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,519
the size of area how big is this area

84
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,360
yeah of course

85
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,220
okay okay so yeah bear in mind this is

86
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,519
the question okay so let's look at this

87
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,680
I need triangle right any triangle if I

88
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,440
find this on any point any point here

89
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,440
right yeah okay I draw this

90
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,660
okay if this is a this is B this is C

91
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,120
this is p okay we'll see

92
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,100
this is the point okay it divides this

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,120
into two triangles am I right what's the

94
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,400
average size of ABC equals half of

95
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,419
this

96
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,840
is PC times the height

97
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:46,199
okay this height is e okay so this size

98
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,020
this area side is equal half of PC times

99
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:52,639
AE this is the lens of BC

100
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:55,740
so it's this page oh our food is

101
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,440
okay so it's p okay I put this okay it's

102
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,580
PC the levels of PC times the length of

103
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:08,160
a okay and what's the area of a c d

104
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:09,780
size of ACC half of c times d a c d the

105
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,280
length times

106
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,880
which height

107
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:18,600
uh is it AC the blind

108
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,340
AE okay the size of ABC is PC times AE

109
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,180
because this is the height divided by

110
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:28,500
two and the size of ACD is CD times the

111
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:32,100
height divided by two so the size of ABC

112
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,740
divided by the size of ACD

113
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,919
right so it's this right it's this look

114
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:41,039
they got half they got half they got AE

115
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,639
they got AE which got cancer so it is

116
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,520
actually the same as BC the size of BC

117
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,500
divides the size of CD the size of this

118
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,680
ABC

119
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:56,759
divided by the size of ACP to triangle

120
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,780
is the same as PC divided by CD if I'm

121
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,620
telling you

122
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:06,539
this size is one PC this here is one

123
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:09,360
here is two here is two the area of ACD

124
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:12,300
this triangle on the right is twice

125
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,100
as thick as the ABC remember we talked

126
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,100
about motor car simulation

127
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,400
which is basically we want to calculate

128
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,280
the PI right so we've asked computers to

129
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,520
generate points I know we count how many

130
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,520
points in a circle and how many points

131
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,500
all together so the ratio is this bit

132
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,600
divided by line we can do this the same

133
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,580
but it's it's a it's just an idea not

134
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,220
maybe not easy to implement so we can

135
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,300
generate the points and put it in this

136
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,400
picture and we count how many points

137
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,319
I don't know why why okay and then we

138
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,840
count how many points

139
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,840
falling into this right but it's hard to

140
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,120
test in in here right so this is just an

141
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,060
idea multicolor simulation okay that's

142
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,259
coming back to do this mathematics

143
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,560
okay

144
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:07,319
how about E5 that's fine that's fine

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,560
it's just number five hundred and six

146
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,560
actually

147
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,800
okay so how about look if I

148
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,300
connect these

149
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,539
cut in half

150
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,259
if I say this is X this is y

151
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:27,479
so look at this it's listed and this bit

152
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,800
right two triangles

153
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:33,539
this

154
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,680
please okay 3 plus X this is the size of

155
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:39,120
it right

156
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,639
divided by y 3 plus X is the size of

157
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,400
this right divided by size of Y is it

158
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:47,699
equal the least length divided by this

159
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,340
length all right this triangle divided

160
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,220
by this triangle is equals DC divided by

161
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,900
CD right so it's equal to least divided

162
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,539
this it's the same thing right it's the

163
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,599
same thing and look at this cylinder

164
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:03,840
there are two right four divided by two

165
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:05,819
is equal to least divided by this

166
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,340
so they both

167
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,620
equals to least divided by light so it

168
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,500
means that that equals four divided by

169
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,599
two all right

170
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,400
now I I have an equation of X and Y but

171
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,960
that's not enough let me repeat it again

172
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,340
okay

173
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,460
this

174
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,560
4 divided by 2 the area is equal to

175
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,520
least divided by left the length of

176
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,520
least divided by left

177
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,719
3 plus X

178
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,599
divided by Y is it the same as least

179
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,700
divided by that so they both equals to

180
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,620
this divided by that so I can put it

181
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,539
together

182
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,539
equals c so a equals c all right

183
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:54,800
2 plus y which is this bit

184
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,800
divided by X

185
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,560
is it equals to least divided by that

186
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,260
yeah this is divided by because this one

187
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,120
4 divided by 3 is equal to this divided

188
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,220
by that

189
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,560
so the policy equals to this divided by

190
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,240
completely together

191
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,980
how do you solve this

192
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,519
in you know how to solve it the a

193
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,019
divided by b equals equals c divided by

194
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,019
B how do we solve this

195
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,240
is it the same thing as a times D equals

196
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,899
B times C okay A times T equals B times

197
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,959
c b and t not equal to zero

198
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:36,959
mathematics dividing by zero not defined

199
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:40,320
one divided by zero notified we don't

200
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,000
know the answer okay it's zero no it's

201
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,760
not defined mathematically notified

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,220
that's a divided by P equals c divided

203
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,519
by three learn how to make it multiply

204
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:54,180
as long as B and D are not zero we can

205
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:57,420
do 80 equals b c right B is times this

206
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:01,200
six plus two x equals release times this

207
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:04,260
or what four times x equals

208
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,839
six plus three one right two equation

209
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,240
two unknown we can solve the value

210
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,760
we times two okay we times two here why

211
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,440
we need to times 2 because I see the 4X

212
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,040
here there are only two x here so I

213
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:21,959
times two on both sides so is twelve

214
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:26,160
plus four x equals a y subtract

215
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:28,880
subtract 4X from this right so it's 12

216
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,000
equals

217
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,700
5y minus six right five y minus six

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,560
five y equals eighteen

219
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,740
y equals

220
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,080
y equals three point six okay and then

221
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,320
we don't know why let's put it back six

222
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,640
plus three times three point six divided

223
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,440
by four

224
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,660
today's weather

225
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,700
4.2

226
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:58,740
x equals 4.2 so what's the size of this

227
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,860
X Plus y

228
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,740
X Plus y equals 7.8

229
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,920
to sum up okay so we what we have

230
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,200
learned today we covered the how do we

231
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,140
get the area of triangle which is the

232
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,079
equals to the length of one side and the

233
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:21,480
height on each side right so it's half

234
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:23,820
of a times H H is the height to the to

235
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,579
left side you pick based on that we can

236
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:30,959
say here this is arbitrary triangle the

237
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:34,140
area of ABC divided by ACP is the same

238
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,360
as BC divided by CB okay and based on

239
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,480
that we can solve this mathematic

240
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:45,140
question any question so far

241
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,140
okay that's it for today bye-bye bye bye
