1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
hello

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,240
hello everyone

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,879
yes okay so today we talk about graphs

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,879
what's graph

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,440
graph is data structure right with the

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,160
vertex and the edges yeah so the graph

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,039
will usually represent what with g

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,680
and then it's a set of what

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,800
a set of can you tell me is the set of v

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,800
and e what's really

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
vertex

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,800
and

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,200
vertex yeah

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,360
and what

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,760
this is vertex yeah

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,760
and what

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,760
that's the vertex and what's this

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,520
what's this what's this

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,800
what's this the connections between the

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,520
vertex

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,480
what do we call it star with e

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,879
[Music]

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,559
e b

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,399
yeah

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,600
vertex and edges

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
okay

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
so

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,200
this graph can be directional or

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,640
bi-directional yeah or any direction so

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,960
we can it can be bi-directional

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,040
what does it mean by direction

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,759
or direction okay

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,720
bi-directional or un-directional which

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,200
is the same iteration

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,600
and direction of iteration this is the

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,159
same thing and direction

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,159
what does it mean

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,799
look if it's directional you can have

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,720
this has error one can go to two but two

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,920
cannot go to one okay

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,320
right let's dive can i have two hours

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,399
yeah if you want to get to go to one you

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,320
have to put this right here right

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,320
then by direction it means you just put

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,200
a one heck of the two two can go to one

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,280
okay

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,960
two can go to three so you can go to two

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,680
so we can go to four or four can go to

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,000
three okay so uh this is the first

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,240
transition okay so if today's top is

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,159
very simple given a bi-directional or

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,399
un-directional graph

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,840
because it means that one thing goes to

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,960
it can go to one

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,560
and

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,440
something like that one two three three

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,520
four

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,440
so for example this one if i tell you

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,000
can can you find the path between one to

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,000
four yeah yeah because you can go to one

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,400
to two two three four okay how about

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,239
there's a graph and not yeah

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,280
five to six

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,480
and then

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,760
seven

66
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,440
can you go from three to seven

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,040
yeah because look this is a separate

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,120
right there's no edges between these two

69
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,640
components yeah simple okay easy yeah so

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,560
we've got this problem so we are given

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,959
these uh

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,360
these so how we are given this input

73
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,920
like one two two two two three three two

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,280
these edges yeah so how do we represent

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,640
the graph

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
how do we represent the graph

77
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,680
diversity remember adjacent adjacent

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,159
magic yeah one can go to

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
adjacent magic so for example like one

80
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,879
two two

81
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,400
two two three okay two two three

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,840
two two four

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,440
okay

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,760
so how do we represent

85
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,050
how how do we represent this we can use

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,680
the

87
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,480
[Music]

88
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,840
key

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,280
key and the value so how can we do this

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,599
the vertex we cut the vertex is the key

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
how what's the vertex one two three four

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,000
yeah

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,040
one two

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
three

95
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,760
four i know what's the value this is the

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,000
vertex vertex

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,400
and then this is the

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,120
value values this is the key here and

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,680
the values will be a list of the

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,560
note vertex list of vertex

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,280
so one can go to do one

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,000
and one can go to two we are done two

103
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
can go to one

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,439
one

105
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,280
four three yeah one four three or one

106
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,599
three four yeah so a list of nodes you

107
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,360
can go to three can go to work

108
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,519
uh two

109
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,640
and four and that one

110
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,879
yeah okay so you see this is the node uh

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,120
additional hash map yeah the keys are

112
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,360
the nodes the vertex the values are list

113
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,360
of the vertex that it can go to okay

114
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,680
yeah so

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,199
so given this

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,880
given this data structure yeah we

117
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,960
already know how to build this the

118
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,720
adjacent matrix from the given edges a

119
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,000
list of edges and

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,919
how can we

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,320
find out if there's a path between the

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,800
target uh the start to the finish to the

123
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,440
end what can we do how many what kind of

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,960
argument are we can we use to traverse

125
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,040
the graph

126
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,240
traverses three three three is also

127
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,400
graph yeah remember we talked about

128
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,120
how do we travel a tree remember how

129
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,440
many kind of eggs

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,440
breakfast such well and

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,680
that's what this is the two we are we

132
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,280
have learned so far okay so today we're

133
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,800
going to use the breakfast

134
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,720
yeah yeah of course yeah i'm showing you

135
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,520
later

136
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,000
three is also a graph okay yeah three is

137
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,240
also graph so breast research can be

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,600
also used to a traversal the

139
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,400
graph okay

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,680
so if for example one i want to find out

141
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,600
if one can go to three right so i put

142
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
the one in the queue yeah but remember

143
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,800
the processor is the cube right we put a

144
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,960
q1 here

145
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,280
so we take one out what's the key of

146
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,720
that one what one can travel to two

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,680
right two

148
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,880
okay i put it to it so i take a two out

149
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,320
where you can travel to one three four

150
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,039
okay so do we need to visit the one

151
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,240
again no because we we already come from

152
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,250
that if we visit if we don't if we keep

153
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,880
visiting what happened

154
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,039
[Music]

155
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,759
it will never end right

156
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,960
because look i just cover one and if i

157
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,280
take i

158
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,720
i put a two and two and comma one and

159
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,360
then it will be a cycle right you will

160
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,720
do this forever right so we need to kind

161
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,800
of what kind of data structure to

162
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,120
remember the notes we have visited

163
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,520
hashtag or notebook yeah we need to do

164
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,160
this this is a special

165
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,160
headset all set yeah set notebook set

166
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,919
okay so we we can start from the

167
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,919
notes and then we keep doing this

168
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,199
breakfast search and here all the notes

169
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,319
has been

170
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,880
searched visited right and if we can't

171
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,800
find the note when we're expanding the

172
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,800
notes if we can't find the finish let

173
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,560
the end then

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,880
then it will turn first otherwise if we

175
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,840
visit it and we'll return to okay simple

176
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,840
as that let's do this

177
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,880
define

178
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,599
that uh

179
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,840
pass past exists

180
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,599
as it is

181
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,319
so we're given a

182
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,800
star star

183
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,560
and the end

184
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,960
and then we're given a list of edges

185
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,720
yeah as this

186
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,280
okay so first of all we want to keep

187
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,440
this address is the list of the staff to

188
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,639
end right so we want to build a graph so

189
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,840
let's say gua equals before

190
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,000
remember what's the key default

191
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,280
dictionary what's the key what key is

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,319
the notes and

193
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,520
value is the list of the integer right

194
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,759
yeah

195
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,759
list

196
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,599
okay

197
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,960
so uh

198
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,560
i think we also need uh uh do we need to

199
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,520
end

200
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,520
no we don't need the n okay

201
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,919
and it's the number of edges like one

202
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,919
two three okay that's fine then we we go

203
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,160
through these four for

204
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,720
s e

205
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,840
in edges right

206
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
so look

207
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,160
g

208
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,039
s

209
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,840
dot append what

210
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,120
open one

211
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,039
um look yes that is e right

212
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,520
remember this is five dimensional so we

213
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,520
need to also need a g e dot apparently

214
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,680
opera s yes

215
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,720
because s can go to e it also means e

216
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,759
can go to s there so i put it in in the

217
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
notes right

218
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,960
this is the remember the value is the

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,400
list of notes it can go to from s yeah

220
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,400
e s can go to e right e can go to s okay

221
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,560
so once we have this adjacent this is

222
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,520
called adjacent metric

223
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,520
adjacent metric

224
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,000
okay adjusting method and then now i

225
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,240
need to

226
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,880
do what perfect search right so i have a

227
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,640
queue how how do we implement a

228
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,080
performance search here using what kind

229
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,720
of data structure

230
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
dk what's the kill mean double ended

231
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,279
thank you and then first of all i need

232
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,279
to put what in it

233
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,360
[Music]

234
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,519
you can travel from a style you can

235
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,200
travel from the end it's the same right

236
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,959
you can start from the start or you can

237
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,040
start from the finish yeah it doesn't

238
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,279
matter okay let's start from the start

239
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,160
yeah start okay

240
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,160
i know remember we need a hash set to

241
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,120
remember the notes we have seen yeah so

242
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,880
sin

243
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
equals what

244
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,760
what kind of data structure

245
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,480
said yes that's set it says contains

246
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,560
only the unique numbers right

247
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,959
and i know how we need to tell it trevor

248
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,220
is why what

249
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,880
why what

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,920
[Music]

251
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,959
why what

252
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,600
why

253
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,200
we have something right yeah why we have

254
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,480
something in the queue

255
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,279
then we have to finish uh place in take

256
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,519
a

257
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,480
element from the queue right so we we do

258
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,200
what

259
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,200
what the top left

260
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,160
what's the problem we want to take a pop

261
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,839
uh take a q the front of the queue for

262
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,440
the element of the queue

263
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,160
what

264
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,360
huh let's let's call it c

265
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,440
c equals q dot pop left yeah yeah let's

266
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,920
call it the kill we have the q we take

267
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,360
our first element look we couldn't take

268
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,240
a one out and

269
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
what do we need to do

270
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,560
first of all we need to find out if c

271
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,720
has been visited before right from the

272
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,360
scene yeah yes c in scene

273
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,480
continue right we have visited this yeah

274
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
can supporters continue

275
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,600
continue to the next without going there

276
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,839
continue means that continue continue to

277
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,560
the next loop yeah

278
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,800
continue okay

279
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,760
if we put a break what happened

280
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,959
um

281
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,839
it will stop stop you will jump to leap

282
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,959
after the loop okay that's what let's be

283
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,920
different

284
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,320
then

285
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,959
if at this point we haven't visited the

286
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,680
sea so we want to v we want to mark it

287
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:03,770
as a visit so how to do this cinder

288
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,770
[Music]

289
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,560
and now i need to

290
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,600
now this is called we already see note

291
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,360
that we want to re expand all the nodes

292
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,880
it converted right

293
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,760
so for

294
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,079
i

295
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,079
in

296
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,480
graph c right

297
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:29,200
and then what do we do we want to what

298
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,440
um depend cue a pen yeah that's why

299
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,880
open i

300
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,900
okay so

301
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,200
wait

302
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,079
[Music]

303
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,079
we

304
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,880
haven't

305
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:46,320
so if if c in sync so before left c here

306
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,120
we need to check if c equal equals n

307
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,920
right

308
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,720
because we already if this is the end

309
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,200
what do we do return one

310
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,519
reason true because we otherwise if this

311
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,839
finish what happened what what do we

312
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,170
mean here return one

313
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,200
what does it mean

[Music]

315
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,800
return

316
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,560
first it means that all the notes has

317
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,639
been visited but we can't find the n

318
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,519
right so that's the breakfast assume

319
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,200
right

320
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,530
yeah

321
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,800
okay does it make sense

322
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,560
[Music]

323
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,720
okay

324
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,480
okay so i'm going to erase this bit okay

325
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,240
so can you write this this is the most

326
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,200
important part okay so what do we do

327
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,440
here

328
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,440

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,120
what does this mean g s upon e g e upon

346
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,120
s

347
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,040
from s to e or e to s so what's the gc

348
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,000
mean

349
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,480
i can go to c yeah yeah all the nodes

350
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,639
can this is all the nodes c can go to

351
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,399
right and then we have nodes i so what

352
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,240
do we need to do

353
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,000
um

354
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,160
a pen yeah we want to push it into the

355
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,480
cube remember for the first research we

356
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,480
take the front of the queue

357
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,000
take the element from the front of q

358
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,440
take it out process it check if it's the

359
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,920
target element which is the end if not

360
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,720
if it's already visited or continue if

361
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,040
not

362
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,199
we explain the notes

363
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,079
if we expand the notes you can visit and

364
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,360
put it uh append on the key remember

365
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,230
yeah remember

366
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,330
what's by versus

367
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,330
[Music]

368
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,920
but

369
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,760
but the graph is the same yeah if you

370
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,480
look if it's a graph

371
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,639
it's the same yeah it's the same it's

372
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,279
the same right yeah so you start from

373
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,920
here so what's next you go to expand is

374
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,120
here here right and you take the tree

375
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,880
here because

376
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,440
yeah yeah and then the next one is you

377
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,800
take this and explain its kids here here

378
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,240
but you don't explain this one because

379
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,560
this one has been

380
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,959
visited before but why we don't have

381
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,160
these in the tree because in the tree

382
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,240
you you don't

383
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,120
you don't visit the parent again right

384
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,959
yeah

385
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,279
so we don't have that problem using the

386
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,680
set but in the graph you don't know if

387
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,320
that's parent right right so we need to

388
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,639
use this it doesn't make sense

389
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,920
what's the time compressed

390
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,839
oh n what's that what's n

391
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,000
number

392
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:03,600
of the number of nodes in the graph in

393
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,839
the vertex what's the space somewhere

394
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,839
um

395
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,360
yeah because we are using

396
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,279
dq and set yeah and the graph here graph

397
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,680
we have lots of this

398
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,079
place okay thanks thank you that's it

399
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,079
good job bye
