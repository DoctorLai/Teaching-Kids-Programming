about uh an interesting uh data
 

7
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,030
about uh an interesting uh data
structure okay so before we talk about a

8
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
structure okay so before we talk about a
 

9
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,709
structure okay so before we talk about a
new data structure what kind of data

new data structure what kind of data
 

11
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,709
new data structure what kind of data
structure have you learned so far

12
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719

17
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,790

what's data structure come on

18
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
what's data structure come on
 

19
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,950
what's data structure come on
um the thing is to

20
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
um the thing is to
 

21
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,950
um the thing is to
hold data so what kind of data structure

22
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
hold data so what kind of data structure
 

23
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,029
hold data so what kind of data structure
in computer science have you learned so

24
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
in computer science have you learned so
 

25
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,230
in computer science have you learned so
far you have learned quite a lot right

26
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
far you have learned quite a lot right
 

27
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,509
far you have learned quite a lot right
what are those can you give me an

set settings contains unique numbers
 

63
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,550

unique elements only hash table when we

64
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
unique elements only hash table when we
 

65
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,109
unique elements only hash table when we
talk about a table we have these keys

66
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
talk about a table we have these keys
 

67
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,990
talk about a table we have these keys
keys values key value pairs yeah

keys values key value pairs yeah
the the time why we need this

70
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
the the time why we need this
 

71
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,109
the the time why we need this
because we we want the constant time or

72
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
because we we want the constant time or
 

73
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,830
because we we want the constant time or
one time to look up the items

74
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
one time to look up the items
 

75
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,069
one time to look up the items
to check if the items exist in a table

76
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
to check if the items exist in a table
 

77
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,030
to check if the items exist in a table
and then it takes the one constant term

78
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
and then it takes the one constant term
 

79
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,149
and then it takes the one constant term
to put it

80
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
to put it
 

81
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,069
to put it
update the entrance in the table okay

82
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
update the entrance in the table okay
 

83
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,230
update the entrance in the table okay

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,270
want to
i want to union these two and these two

176
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
i want to union these two and these two
 

177
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,110
i want to union these two and these two
becomes a group right and how many

178
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
becomes a group right and how many
 

179
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,509
becomes a group right and how many
groups are there

180
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
groups are there
 

181
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,910
groups are there
three yeah yeah okay so this is the

182
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
three yeah yeah okay so this is the
 

183
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,309
three yeah yeah okay so this is the
basic data structure so why is it useful

184
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
basic data structure so why is it useful
 

185
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,070
basic data structure so why is it useful
remember

186
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
remember
 

187
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,190
remember
remember

188
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
remember
 

189
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,990
remember
remember we have these yeah

190
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
remember we have these yeah
 

191
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,949
remember we have these yeah
we want to find out if there is a path

192
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
we want to find out if there is a path
 

193
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,309
we want to find out if there is a path
between

194
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
between
 

195
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,229
between
remember a few days ago we talked about

196
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
remember a few days ago we talked about
 

197
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:14,949
remember a few days ago we talked about
it

198
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
it
 

199
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,870
it
we want to find out if there's a path

200
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
we want to find out if there's a path
 

201
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,710
we want to find out if there's a path
between zero

202
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
between zero
 

203
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,830
between zero
to five

204
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
to five
 

205
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,150
to five
right no yeah we use the

206
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
right no yeah we use the
 

207
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,510
right no yeah we use the
volcano algorithm

208
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520

 

209
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,110

we have done two aggregates to solve

210
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
we have done two aggregates to solve
 

211
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,629
we have done two aggregates to solve
this problem to find out if there's a

212
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
this problem to find out if there's a
 

213
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,070
this problem to find out if there's a
path between

214
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
path between
 

215
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,390
path between
bitterness

216
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
bitterness
 

217
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,510
bitterness
we have uh we took between final parts

218
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
we have uh we took between final parts
 

219
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,749
we have uh we took between final parts
e6 in the graph right

220
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
e6 in the graph right
 

221
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,030
e6 in the graph right
yeah so what kind of agreement do we use

222
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
yeah so what kind of agreement do we use
 

223
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,670
yeah so what kind of agreement do we use
come on to travis the graph

224
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
come on to travis the graph
 

225
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,670
come on to travis the graph
to travel to the graph

226
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
to travel to the graph
 

227
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,810
to travel to the graph
what kind of algorithm do we use

228
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:47,820
what kind of algorithm do we use
 

229
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,510
what kind of algorithm do we use
[Music]

230
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
[Music]
 

231
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,629
[Music]
um

232
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639

 

233
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,110

so for definition we find out if there

234
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
so for definition we find out if there
 

235
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,590
so for definition we find out if there
pass for purposes also we expand it in

236
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
pass for purposes also we expand it in
 

237
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,510
pass for purposes also we expand it in
the uh double ended queue and i will try

238
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
the uh double ended queue and i will try
 

239
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,310
the uh double ended queue and i will try
to

240
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
to
 

241
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,350
to
uh exhaust it all the nodes yeah before

242
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
uh exhaust it all the nodes yeah before
 

243
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,469
uh exhaust it all the nodes yeah before
we we find if if there's a path if

244
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
we we find if if there's a path if
 

245
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,469
we we find if if there's a path if
if it does pass we return to otherwise

246
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
if it does pass we return to otherwise
 

247
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,029
if it does pass we return to otherwise
we determine first so so to solve this

248
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
we determine first so so to solve this
 

249
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,510
we determine first so so to solve this
problem if we can consider this graph

250
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
problem if we can consider this graph
 

251
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,029
problem if we can consider this graph
you know as different

252
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
you know as different
 

253
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,950
you know as different
all right look at the beginning how many

254
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
all right look at the beginning how many
 

255
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,070
all right look at the beginning how many
notes

256
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
notes
 

257
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,110
notes
zero

258
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
zero
 

259
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,710
zero
one two three four five if this is five

260
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
one two three four five if this is five
 

261
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,469
one two three four five if this is five
notes okay

262
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
notes okay
 

263
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,469
notes okay
uh that's six notes all right

264
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
uh that's six notes all right
 

265
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,350
uh that's six notes all right
okay

266
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
okay
 

267
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,590
okay
so zero to one

268
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
so zero to one
 

269
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,909
so zero to one
these at the beginning these belongs to

270
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
these at the beginning these belongs to
 

271
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,590
these at the beginning these belongs to
different groups how many groups are

272
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
different groups how many groups are
 

273
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,790
different groups how many groups are
there

274
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
there
 

275
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,510
there
six six zero okay so i found the h zero

276
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
six six zero okay so i found the h zero
 

277
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,830
six six zero okay so i found the h zero
to one connected to the other one

278
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
to one connected to the other one
 

279
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,670
to one connected to the other one
so what does it mean

280
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
so what does it mean
 

281
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,189
so what does it mean
if there is an edge

282
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
if there is an edge
 

283
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,950
if there is an edge
zero and one belongs to the same group

284
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
zero and one belongs to the same group
 

285
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,990
zero and one belongs to the same group
right

286
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
right
 

287
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,270
right
yeah

288
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
yeah
 

289
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,749
yeah
so what do you mean i put it together

290
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
so what do you mean i put it together
 

291
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,189
so what do you mean i put it together
okay two zero to two what does it mean

292
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199

 

293
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,710

i want to put the two in the same group

294
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
i want to put the two in the same group
 

295
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,510
i want to put the two in the same group
right

296
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
right
 

297
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,189
right
yeah

298
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
yeah
 

299
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,870
yeah
so same group

300
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
so same group
 

301
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,590
so same group
three to four

302
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
three to four
 

303
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,189
three to four
same group right three to five

304
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
same group right three to five
 

305
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,670
same group right three to five
same group

306
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
same group
 

307
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,510
same group
is zero and five belongs to the same

308
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
is zero and five belongs to the same
 

309
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,990
is zero and five belongs to the same
group

310
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000

 

311
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,590

they're a different group so they are

312
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
they're a different group so they are
 

313
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,749
they're a different group so they are
not connected there's no path between

314
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
not connected there's no path between
 

315
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,469
not connected there's no path between
zero to five

316
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
zero to five
 

317
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,189
zero to five
is there a plus between zero to two yeah

318
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
is there a plus between zero to two yeah
 

319
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,710
is there a plus between zero to two yeah
why is that because they belong to the

320
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
why is that because they belong to the
 

321
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,070
why is that because they belong to the
same group

322
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080

 

323
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,870

yeah that's why we use the strong set i

324
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
yeah that's why we use the strong set i
 

325
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,390
yeah that's why we use the strong set i
i'm just talking about

326
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
i'm just talking about
 

327
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,309
i'm just talking about
how how to solve that problem even

328
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
how how to solve that problem even
 

329
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,230
how how to solve that problem even
though this one is easier right

330
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
though this one is easier right
 

331
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,070
though this one is easier right
yeah it seems easier yeah i just you

332
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
yeah it seems easier yeah i just you
 

333
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,550
yeah it seems easier yeah i just you
know if i edge what does the edge means

334
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
know if i edge what does the edge means
 

335
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,950
know if i edge what does the edge means
these do not belong to the same group

336
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
these do not belong to the same group
 

337
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,830
these do not belong to the same group
right

338
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
right
 

339
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,550
right
and

340
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
and
 

341
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,270
and
it's now path between zero to four

342
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
it's now path between zero to four
 

343
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,430
it's now path between zero to four
because they are only different group

344
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
because they are only different group
 

345
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,350
because they are only different group
right

346
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
right
 

347
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,430
right
so this is very useful so

348
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
so this is very useful so
 

349
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,110
so this is very useful so
to solve this problem we need to

350
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
to solve this problem we need to
 

351
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,510
to solve this problem we need to
discharge that at the beginning each

352
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
discharge that at the beginning each
 

353
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,390
discharge that at the beginning each
note is different individual group

354
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
note is different individual group
 

355
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,990
note is different individual group
but when we have a

356
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
but when we have a
 

357
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,510
but when we have a
a function to call unite unite yeah is

358
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
a function to call unite unite yeah is
 

359
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,550
a function to call unite unite yeah is
it the way to correctly spell the word

360
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
it the way to correctly spell the word
 

361
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,670
it the way to correctly spell the word
merge to all we can to call it much

362
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
merge to all we can to call it much
 

363
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,550
merge to all we can to call it much
much

364
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
much
 

365
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,589
much
better

366
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
better
 

367
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,749
better
if we merge what is mean general one and

368
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
if we merge what is mean general one and
 

369
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,550
if we merge what is mean general one and
we

370
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
we
 

371
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,189
we
update the data structure to make them

372
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
update the data structure to make them
 

373
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,189
update the data structure to make them
make both

374
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
make both
 

375
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:23,990
make both
uh

376
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
uh
 

377
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,070
uh
belongs to the same group and we also

378
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
belongs to the same group and we also
 

379
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,270
belongs to the same group and we also
have another function called find

380
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
have another function called find
 

381
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,189
have another function called find
find parent

382
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
find parent
 

383
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,589
find parent
find group okay find group

384
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
find group okay find group
 

385
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,510
find group okay find group
so this will return a different group

386
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
so this will return a different group
 

387
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,950
so this will return a different group
yeah find a group of two right yeah

388
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
yeah find a group of two right yeah
 

389
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,909
yeah find a group of two right yeah
and we also have one

390
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
and we also have one
 

391
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,110
and we also have one
group count group

392
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
group count group
 

393
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,589
group count group
group count yeah to tell how many goals

394
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
group count yeah to tell how many goals
 

395
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,749
group count yeah to tell how many goals
are there at the end there are two right

396
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
are there at the end there are two right
 

397
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,309
are there at the end there are two right
and what else do we need uh what else do

398
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
and what else do we need uh what else do
 

399
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,189
and what else do we need uh what else do
we need

400
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199

 

401
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,670

if it's a same group yeah belongs to

402
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
if it's a same group yeah belongs to
 

403
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,189
if it's a same group yeah belongs to
same group

404
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
same group
 

405
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,029
same group
so this is easier how do you implement

406
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039
so this is easier how do you implement
 

407
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,189
so this is easier how do you implement
the same group two numbers

408
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
the same group two numbers
 

409
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,390
the same group two numbers
a and b

410
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
a and b
 

411
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,110
a and b
you just need to check if the group is

412
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
you just need to check if the group is
 

413
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,909
you just need to check if the group is
the same find group a equals to find

414
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
the same find group a equals to find
 

415
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,390
the same find group a equals to find
group b right if they are same group

416
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
group b right if they are same group
 

417
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,029
group b right if they are same group
they reproduce the group number okay so

418
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
they reproduce the group number okay so
 

419
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,230
they reproduce the group number okay so
what's group so at the beginning okay so

420
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
what's group so at the beginning okay so
 

421
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,390
what's group so at the beginning okay so
that's easy look how how can we do this

422
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
that's easy look how how can we do this
 

423
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,869
that's easy look how how can we do this
okay so first of all we have a parent

424
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
okay so first of all we have a parent
 

425
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,790
okay so first of all we have a parent
okay parent class let's define class

426
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
okay parent class let's define class
 

427
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,630
okay parent class let's define class
disjoint set okay let's try disjoint set

428
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
disjoint set okay let's try disjoint set
 

429
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,870
disjoint set okay let's try disjoint set
disjoint

430
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
disjoint
 

431
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,870
disjoint
set

432
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
set
 

433
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,469
set
okay so

434
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
okay so
 

435
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,990
okay so
at the beginning we want to have a

436
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
at the beginning we want to have a
 

437
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,230
at the beginning we want to have a
constructor remember how to construct

438
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
constructor remember how to construct
 

439
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,750
constructor remember how to construct
because in it

440
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
because in it
 

441
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,870
because in it
initially

442
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
initially
 

443
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,190
initially
and we're given a n n is the number of

444
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
and we're given a n n is the number of
 

445
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,389
and we're given a n n is the number of
the

446
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
the
 

447
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,990
the
at the beginning and the initial group

448
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
at the beginning and the initial group
 

449
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,670
at the beginning and the initial group
number okay if it is a

450
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
number okay if it is a
 

451
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,350
number okay if it is a
0 1

452
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
0 1
 

453
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,990
0 1
one two three four five so we just pass

454
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
one two three four five so we just pass
 

455
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,870
one two three four five so we just pass
one

456
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
one
 

457
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,310
one
six okay then you from zero to five

458
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
six okay then you from zero to five
 

459
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,710
six okay then you from zero to five
so that lets herself then we can

460
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
so that lets herself then we can
 

461
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,389
so that lets herself then we can
construct self the parent

462
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399

 

463
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,190

parent equals least

464
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
parent equals least
 

465
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,430
parent equals least
range

466
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
range
 

467
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,470
range
n okay so in the beginning if any given

468
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
n okay so in the beginning if any given
 

469
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,310
n okay so in the beginning if any given
of six

470
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
of six
 

471
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,150
of six
six so the parent is a list list of zero

472
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
six so the parent is a list list of zero
 

473
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,990
six so the parent is a list list of zero
one two three four five

474
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
one two three four five
 

475
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,990
one two three four five
okay so what does it mean at the

476
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
okay so what does it mean at the
 

477
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,110
okay so what does it mean at the
beginning at the beginning zero one two

478
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
beginning at the beginning zero one two
 

479
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,030
beginning at the beginning zero one two
three four five

480
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
three four five
 

481
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,590
three four five
these six groups

482
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
these six groups
 

483
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,790
these six groups
these six

484
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
these six
 

485
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,190
these six
there are six group and the number is

486
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
there are six group and the number is
 

487
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,670
there are six group and the number is
the group id right

488
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
the group id right
 

489
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,430
the group id right
all right yeah

490
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
all right yeah
 

491
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,910
all right yeah
so how how can we make if if i want to

492
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
so how how can we make if if i want to
 

493
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,150
so how how can we make if if i want to
make a multi one and two

494
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
make a multi one and two
 

495
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,509
make a multi one and two
so what does it mean

496
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
so what does it mean
 

497
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,630
so what does it mean
i need to i need to change

498
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
i need to i need to change
 

499
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,269
i need to i need to change
right if i want to look one and two if i

500
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
right if i want to look one and two if i
 

501
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,990
right if i want to look one and two if i
want to merge these two what happens

502
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
want to merge these two what happens
 

503
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,910
want to merge these two what happens
so i just need to change this value to

504
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
so i just need to change this value to
 

505
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,590
so i just need to change this value to
one right

506
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
one right
 

507
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,990
one right
yeah then these two belongs to the same

508
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
yeah then these two belongs to the same
 

509
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,470
yeah then these two belongs to the same
group if i want to merge one three and

510
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
group if i want to merge one three and
 

511
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,710
group if i want to merge one three and
five i can change three to five or five

512
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
five i can change three to five or five
 

513
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,829
five i can change three to five or five
to three

514
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
to three
 

515
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,790
to three
right

516
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
right
 

517
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,790
right
yeah okay this is called a merge just to

518
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
yeah okay this is called a merge just to
 

519
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,949
yeah okay this is called a merge just to
change one the pair just change the

520
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
change one the pair just change the
 

521
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,509
change one the pair just change the
parent value of one note to and to a

522
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
parent value of one note to and to a
 

523
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,870
parent value of one note to and to a
value that's a good writing and

524
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
value that's a good writing and
 

525
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,030
value that's a good writing and
initially there are six group letter

526
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
initially there are six group letter
 

527
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,190
initially there are six group letter
group id these are guru ideas zero one

528
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
group id these are guru ideas zero one
 

529
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,430
group id these are guru ideas zero one
two three four five okay

530

that's same group same group
 

543
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,829
that's same group same group
given two numbers a b how can we find if

544
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
given two numbers a b how can we find if
 

545
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,030
given two numbers a b how can we find if
the same group

546
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
the same group
 

547
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:52,710
the same group
how can we find investing group

548
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720

one
 

573
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,310
one
two right so if the same group at the

574
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
two right so if the same group at the
 

575
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,750
two right so if the same group at the
beginning

576
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
beginning
 

577
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,590
beginning
at the beginning we need to

578
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
at the beginning we need to
 

579
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,190
at the beginning we need to
have a function to find the parent of it

580
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
have a function to find the parent of it
 

581
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,430
have a function to find the parent of it
right to find the parents of it so how

582
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
right to find the parents of it so how
 

583
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,509
right to find the parents of it so how
can we find the parameter i give this

584
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
can we find the parameter i give this
 

585
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,990
can we find the parameter i give this
empty for for now so how can we find a

586
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
empty for for now so how can we find a
 

587
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,750
empty for for now so how can we find a
parent we need to have this fine parent

588
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
parent we need to have this fine parent
 

589
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,670
parent we need to have this fine parent
find parent function okay x let's find x

590
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
find parent function okay x let's find x
 

591
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,829
find parent function okay x let's find x
okay so so what does it mean what does

592
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
okay so so what does it mean what does
 

593
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,750
okay so so what does it mean what does
it mean look look

594
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
it mean look look
 

595
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,990
it mean look look
look at eric look if d at the beginning

596
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
look at eric look if d at the beginning
 

597
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,470
look at eric look if d at the beginning
this is zero and then zero will be point

598
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
this is zero and then zero will be point
 

599
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,030
this is zero and then zero will be point
two itself yeah and then if most one to

600
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
two itself yeah and then if most one to
 

601
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,389
two itself yeah and then if most one to
it one could be much here if we have

602
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
it one could be much here if we have
 

603
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,829
it one could be much here if we have
another two vertically yeah

604
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
another two vertically yeah
 

605
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,990
another two vertically yeah
three yeah so look

606
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
three yeah so look
 

607
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,629
three yeah so look
if three's parents if three belongs to

608
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
if three's parents if three belongs to
 

609
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,870
if three's parents if three belongs to
the two group or two two also becomes

610
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
the two group or two two also becomes
 

611
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,590
the two group or two two also becomes
school of one so these are all connected

612
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
school of one so these are all connected
 

613
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,670
school of one so these are all connected
right but how can i make sure at least i

614
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
right but how can i make sure at least i
 

615
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,910
right but how can i make sure at least i
want to get the value of zero the group

616
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
want to get the value of zero the group
 

617
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,750
want to get the value of zero the group
of zero because all these

618
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
of zero because all these
 

619
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,550
of zero because all these
three belongs to two two belongs to one

620
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
three belongs to two two belongs to one
 

621
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,550
three belongs to two two belongs to one
one belongs to zero it could be

622
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
one belongs to zero it could be
 

623
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,310
one belongs to zero it could be
there could be a link right so i need to

624
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
there could be a link right so i need to
 

625
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,710
there could be a link right so i need to
find out the parent of the x so how can

626
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
find out the parent of the x so how can
 

627
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,069
find out the parent of the x so how can
i say if

628
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
i say if
 

629
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,870
i say if
x not equals seventh apparent

630
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
x not equals seventh apparent
 

631
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,069
x not equals seventh apparent
okay seventh of parent x

632
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
okay seventh of parent x
 

633
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,790
okay seventh of parent x
if x equals seventh apparent x what does

634
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
if x equals seventh apparent x what does
 

635
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,949
if x equals seventh apparent x what does
this mean if at the beginning look

636
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
this mean if at the beginning look
 

637
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,750
this mean if at the beginning look
x equals ten separate x then this is the

638
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
x equals ten separate x then this is the
 

639
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,110
x equals ten separate x then this is the
group group

640
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
group group
 

641
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,030
group group
this is the parent of it right does it

642
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
this is the parent of it right does it
 

643
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,509
this is the parent of it right does it
make sense eric i i yeah that makes

644
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
make sense eric i i yeah that makes
 

645
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,150

if yellow right this is a good idea if
 

661
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,430
if yellow right this is a good idea if
an elast right change here zero you know

662
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
an elast right change here zero you know
 

663
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,350
an elast right change here zero you know
i want to find the group of the parents

664
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
i want to find the group of the parents
 

665
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,829
i want to find the group of the parents
of the group of

666
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839
of the group of
 

667
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,069
of the group of
zero clubs yellow is equal to zero let

668
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
zero clubs yellow is equal to zero let
 

669
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,910
zero clubs yellow is equal to zero let
me return here right

670
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
me return here right
 

671
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,790
me return here right
if look if this is zero and i want to

672
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
if look if this is zero and i want to
 

673
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,310
if look if this is zero and i want to
find the group of it

674
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
find the group of it
 

675
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,389
find the group of it
apparently it's not equal

676
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
apparently it's not equal
 

677
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,269
apparently it's not equal
right

678
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
right
 

679

right
so what does it equal

680
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
so what does it equal
 

681
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,069
so what does it equal
what does it equal look

682
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
what does it equal look
 

683
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,949
what does it equal look
um x is one right

684
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
um x is one right
 

685
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,670
um x is one right
x one is not equals to

686
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
x one is not equals to
 

687
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,750
x one is not equals to
zero right

688
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
zero right
 

689
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,069
zero right
yeah

690
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079

 

691
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,389

third parent x is one it's not equal to

692
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
third parent x is one it's not equal to
 

693
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,310
third parent x is one it's not equal to
what so what happened what what's this

694
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
what so what happened what what's this
 

695
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,230
what so what happened what what's this
it should be zero right

696
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
it should be zero right
 

697
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,710
it should be zero right
so i need to do what i need to return

698
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720

 

699
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,670

what find parent

700
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680

 

701
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,670

501

702
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680

 

703
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,470

save the parent x

704
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480
save the parent x
 

705
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,590
save the parent x
yeah

706
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
yeah
 

707
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,670
yeah
yeah i just call it cell root save the

708
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
yeah i just call it cell root save the
 

709
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,870
yeah i just call it cell root save the
parent x

710
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
parent x
 

711
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,269
parent x
theta parenthesis is zero

712
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
theta parenthesis is zero
 

713
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,150
theta parenthesis is zero
yeah because the current is one

714
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
yeah because the current is one
 

715
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,750
yeah because the current is one
one

716
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
one
 

717
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,710
one
and then one is the same group as zero

718
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
and then one is the same group as zero
 

719
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,110
and then one is the same group as zero
so i want to find out the zero group so

720
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
so i want to find out the zero group so
 

721
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,790
so i want to find out the zero group so
i need to put this here so it could

722
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
i need to put this here so it could
 

723
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,790
i need to put this here so it could
because we call itself right

724
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
because we call itself right
 

725
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,509
because we call itself right
okay so that's what he here says look

726
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
okay so that's what he here says look
 

727
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,550
okay so that's what he here says look
zero

728
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
zero
 

729
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,269
zero
if if here is one

730
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
if if here is one
 

731
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,629
if if here is one
right

732
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639
right
 

733
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,230
right
the second two is the same group as zero

734
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
the second two is the same group as zero
 

735
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,790
the second two is the same group as zero
and then two is the same group as one

736
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
and then two is the same group as one
 

737
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,790
and then two is the same group as one
right i want to find out the two the

738
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
right i want to find out the two the
 

739
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,910
right i want to find out the two the
group of two here

740
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
group of two here
 

741
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,910
group of two here
look i want to find out the group uh the

742
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
look i want to find out the group uh the
 

743
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,710
look i want to find out the group uh the
group

744
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
group
 

745
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,110
group
id of this one i need to find out

746
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
id of this one i need to find out
 

747
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,710
id of this one i need to find out
in order to find out the group of these

748
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
in order to find out the group of these
 

749
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,310
in order to find out the group of these
i need to find out the group of these in

750
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
i need to find out the group of these in
 

751
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,829
i need to find out the group of these in
order to find out the group of one i

752
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
order to find out the group of one i
 

753
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,829
order to find out the group of one i
need to find out the proof zero

754
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
need to find out the proof zero
 

755
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,509
need to find out the proof zero
and here

756
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
and here
 

757
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,710
and here
and here one and here the group of excel

758
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
and here one and here the group of excel
 

759
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,910
and here one and here the group of excel
equals

760
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:05,920
equals
 

761
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,629
equals
the zero the zero value equals the group

762
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:08,639
the zero the zero value equals the group
 

763
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,509
the zero the zero value equals the group
of

764
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:09,519
of
 

765
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,629
of
the parent of it right yeah got it

766
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
the parent of it right yeah got it
 

767
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,069
the parent of it right yeah got it
okay

768
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
okay
 

769
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,389
okay
yeah so that's why it says three

770
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:16,399
yeah so that's why it says three
 

771
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,150
yeah so that's why it says three
points to two two points to one

772
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160

 

773
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,829

so

774
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
so
 

775
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,990
so
look

776
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
look
 

777
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,910
look
in the worst case right in the worst

778
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
in the worst case right in the worst
 

779
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,350
in the worst case right in the worst
case what's the term complexity of

780
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
case what's the term complexity of
 

781
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,990
case what's the term complexity of
looking at the parents of the

782
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
looking at the parents of the
 

783
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,030
looking at the parents of the
of of the elements yeah in the worst

784
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
of of the elements yeah in the worst
 

785
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,150
of of the elements yeah in the worst
case

786
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
case
 

787
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,590
case
or

788
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
or
 

789
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,910
or
oh and right now look if there are ten

790
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
oh and right now look if there are ten
 

791
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,790
oh and right now look if there are ten
yeah look it could be yeah

792
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
yeah look it could be yeah
 

793
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,430
yeah look it could be yeah
look if all these are connected

794
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
look if all these are connected
 

795
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,629
look if all these are connected
what happened if i want to find out

796
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
what happened if i want to find out
 

797
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,910
what happened if i want to find out
group of four

798
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
group of four
 

799
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,990
group of four
it points it says okay the group of four

800
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
it points it says okay the group of four
 

801
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,990
it points it says okay the group of four
is the same as group of three

802
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
is the same as group of three
 

803
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,470
is the same as group of three
okay the group of three is

804
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
okay the group of three is
 

805
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,670
okay the group of three is
two

806
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
two
 

807
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,069
two
is

808
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079

 

809
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,150

right i need to follow the path right

810
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
right i need to follow the path right
 

811
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,509
right i need to follow the path right
yeah is there a way to make it

812
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
yeah is there a way to make it
 

813
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,910
yeah is there a way to make it
i mean better because i don't want to

814
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:03,920
i mean better because i don't want to
 

815
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,550
i mean better because i don't want to
query so many so in order to do this i

816
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
query so many so in order to do this i
 

817
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,670
query so many so in order to do this i
can can i need to compress compress the

818
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
can can i need to compress compress the
 

819
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,870
can can i need to compress compress the
path

820
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
path
 

821
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,670
path
compress the path so what is it the same

822
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
compress the path so what is it the same
 

823
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,069
compress the path so what is it the same
as what zero

824
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
as what zero
 

825
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,269
as what zero
one

826
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
one
 

827
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,470
one
two

828
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
two
 

829
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,509
two
three

830
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
three
 

831
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,310
three
four

832
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
four
 

833
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,749
four
right

834
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
right
 

835
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,069
right
which one is uh more efficient including

836
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
which one is uh more efficient including
 

837
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,710
which one is uh more efficient including
this one why is that it's at most one

838
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
this one why is that it's at most one
 

839
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,069
this one why is that it's at most one
yeah for you know i can't create it for

840
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
yeah for you know i can't create it for
 

841
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,189
yeah for you know i can't create it for
here zero zero points to the cell right

842
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
here zero zero points to the cell right
 

843
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,150
here zero zero points to the cell right
yeah this is the root right the group

844
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
yeah this is the root right the group
 

845
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,470
yeah this is the root right the group
root it's like a tree

846
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
root it's like a tree
 

847
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,949
root it's like a tree
right everybody got it

848
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
right everybody got it
 

849
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,629
right everybody got it
right and don't don't mess up with my

850
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
right and don't don't mess up with my
 

851
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,269
right and don't don't mess up with my
camera okay okay so how can we do this

852
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
camera okay okay so how can we do this
 

853
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,430
camera okay okay so how can we do this
how can we compress the trees

854
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440
how can we compress the trees
 

855
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,189
how can we compress the trees
at the past

856
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
at the past
 

857
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,150
at the past
we just have to do one thing here

858
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
we just have to do one thing here
 

859
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,749
we just have to do one thing here

parent x is this currently snow i want
 

921
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,909
parent x is this currently snow i want
to point to the root and then this root

922
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
to point to the root and then this root
 

923
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,029
to point to the root and then this root
is recursively obtained from current x

924
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
is recursively obtained from current x
 

925
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,909
is recursively obtained from current x
uh five parent dot parent or x and then

926
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:17,919
uh five parent dot parent or x and then
 

927
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,110
uh five parent dot parent or x and then
our friendly return c of the parallax

928
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
our friendly return c of the parallax
 

929
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,710
our friendly return c of the parallax
okay

930
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
okay
 

931
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,549
okay
okay so so what happened here look four

932
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
okay so so what happened here look four
 

933
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,950
okay so so what happened here look four
points to three three points to two two

934
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
points to three three points to two two
 

935
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,669
points to three three points to two two
points to one one points to zero yeah

936
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
points to one one points to zero yeah
 

937
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,110
points to one one points to zero yeah
when i put it

938
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
when i put it
 

939
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,350
when i put it
no no no no when i put when i query

940
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
no no no no when i put when i query
 

941
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,950
no no no no when i put when i query
parent four

942
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
parent four
 

943
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,510
parent four
okay what it does is what parent four i

944
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
okay what it does is what parent four i
 

945
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,710
okay what it does is what parent four i
want to point to parent of three here

946
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
want to point to parent of three here
 

947
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,470
want to point to parent of three here
which is parent two parallel one and

948
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
which is parent two parallel one and
 

949
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,390
which is parent two parallel one and
paragraph so eventually this function

950
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
paragraph so eventually this function
 

951
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,150
paragraph so eventually this function
will do some parentheses so i will point

952
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
will do some parentheses so i will point
 

953
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,029
will do some parentheses so i will point
here

954
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039
here
 

955
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,870
here
i will move this and i will be point

956
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
i will move this and i will be point
 

957
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,830
i will move this and i will be point
here

958
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
here
 

959
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,549
here
i will move this i will be point here

960
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,559
i will move this i will be point here
 

961
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,630
i will move this i will be point here
yeah so immediately you will become zero

962
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
yeah so immediately you will become zero
 

963
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,909
yeah so immediately you will become zero
one two

964
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
one two
 

965
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,630
one two
three four this is to call compress the

966
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
three four this is to call compress the
 

967
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,630
three four this is to call compress the
path yeah so that will reduce the

968
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:04,640
path yeah so that will reduce the
 

969
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,510
path yeah so that will reduce the
that will improve the complexity of the

970
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
that will improve the complexity of the
 

971
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,630
that will improve the complexity of the
finding the past five parents from on

972
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
finding the past five parents from on
 

973
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,950
finding the past five parents from on
roughly 201 constant time okay yeah

974
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:16,960
roughly 201 constant time okay yeah
 

975
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,510
roughly 201 constant time okay yeah
yeah when we clearly release we we

976
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
yeah when we clearly release we we
 

977
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,789
yeah when we clearly release we we
compress the path and this could be done

978
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
compress the path and this could be done
 

979
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,029
compress the path and this could be done
using interactivity okay not not

980
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
using interactivity okay not not
 

981
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,270
using interactivity okay not not
recursion how can we do this okay

982
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280

989
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,430

first of all we want to find the parent

990
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440
first of all we want to find the parent
 

991
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,830
first of all we want to find the parent
of x yeah so how can we do this

992
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
of x yeah so how can we do this
 

993
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,990

how can we do this

994
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,000

 

995
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,630

we want to follow up yeah so

996
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:46,640
we want to follow up yeah so
 

997
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,430
we want to follow up yeah so
we have this parent x equals x

998
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
we have this parent x equals x
 

999
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,870
we have this parent x equals x
y

1000
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880

p x not equals to x
 

1003
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,750
p x not equals to x
what p x equals parent

1004
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
what p x equals parent
 

1005
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,710
what p x equals parent
okay apparently seven parentheses x

1006
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
okay apparently seven parentheses x
 

1007
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,149
okay apparently seven parentheses x
so now

1008
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
so now
 

1009
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,430
so now
p x naught equals x p x equals parent x

1010
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
p x naught equals x p x equals parent x

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,310
three points to two points to one points
to zero what does it mean if x is three

1018
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
to zero what does it mean if x is three
 

1019
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,390
to zero what does it mean if x is three
what's the value of p x eric what's the

1020
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
what's the value of p x eric what's the
 

1021
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,789
what's the value of p x eric what's the
value of dx what's the value of px it is

1022
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
value of dx what's the value of px it is
 

1023
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,909
value of dx what's the value of px it is
yeah

1024
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919

 

1025
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,390

yeah

1026
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400

 

1027
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,470

all right look

1028
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
all right look
 

1029
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,909
all right look
p x is

1030
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
p x is
 

1031
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,990
p x is
x is three

1032
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
x is three
 

1033
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,270
x is three
why p x not equals x

1034
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280
why p x not equals x
 

1035
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,270
why p x not equals x
p x is not equals three uh

1036
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280

 

1037
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,750

yeah

1038
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760

 

1039
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,870

okay so there's a problem p x equals uh

1040
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:46,880
okay so there's a problem p x equals uh
 

1041
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,350
okay so there's a problem p x equals uh
x y p x naught equals f of the parent

1042
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
x y p x naught equals f of the parent
 

1043
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,750
x y p x naught equals f of the parent
okay so here is let me say okay

1044
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
okay so here is let me say okay
 

1045
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,110
okay so here is let me say okay
y not equals to the parent x so because

1046
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
y not equals to the parent x so because
 

1047
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,990
y not equals to the parent x so because
look if if p x equals parent x what does

1048
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
look if if p x equals parent x what does
 

1049
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,669
look if if p x equals parent x what does
it mean if if a value x equals parent x

1050
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
it mean if if a value x equals parent x
 

1051
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,390
it mean if if a value x equals parent x
then x is the group right it's the root

1052
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
then x is the group right it's the root
 

1053
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,870
then x is the group right it's the root
right y is not the root

1054
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
right y is not the root
 

1055
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,990
right y is not the root
why this is not a root i go up i go up i

1056
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
why this is not a root i go up i go up i
 

1057
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,149
why this is not a root i go up i go up i
go out go up until i reach the root

1058
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
go out go up until i reach the root
 

1059
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,390
go out go up until i reach the root
which is zero it's pointing itself right

1060
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
which is zero it's pointing itself right
 

1061
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,590
which is zero it's pointing itself right
look alright

1062
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,600
look alright
 

1063
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,990
look alright
so eventually this px will be number

1064
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
so eventually this px will be number
 

1065
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,430
so eventually this px will be number
zero

1066
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,440
zero
 

1067
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,710
zero
all right

1068
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
all right
 

1069
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,350
all right
are you lost

1070
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,360
are you lost
 

1071
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,580
are you lost
okay so what's the value of ps

1072
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:28,590
okay so what's the value of ps
 

1073
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,390
okay so what's the value of ps
[Music]

1074
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
[Music]
 

1075
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,590
[Music]
yeah i know but when when x is three

1076
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
yeah i know but when when x is three
 

1077
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,590
yeah i know but when when x is three
so what's the parent what's the px after

1078
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
so what's the parent what's the px after
 

1079
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,630
so what's the parent what's the px after
this loop p s naught equals parallel x

1080
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
this loop p s naught equals parallel x
 

1081
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,870
this loop p s naught equals parallel x
pattern x is what

1082
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:40,880
pattern x is what
 

1083
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,549
pattern x is what
what's pattern x

1084
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559

 

1085
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,909

yeah

1086
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
yeah
 

1087
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,470
yeah
2 is not equal to parent x

1088
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
2 is not equal to parent x
 

1089
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,029
2 is not equal to parent x
go here 0 is the parent x what's the

1090
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
go here 0 is the parent x what's the
 

1091
00:21:53,039 --> 00:22:03,270
go here 0 is the parent x what's the
value of x

1092
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:03,280

 

1093
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,750

yeah so while

1094
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
yeah so while
 

1095
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,470
yeah so while
x not equals to p x

1096
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
x not equals to p x
 

1097
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,350
x not equals to p x
y x not equals to p x i want to compress

1098
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
y x not equals to p x i want to compress
 

1099
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,430
y x not equals to p x i want to compress
the load there so first of all i need to

1100
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
the load there so first of all i need to
 

1101
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,630
the load there so first of all i need to
do what

1102
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,640
do what
 

1103
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,110
do what
i need to do what

1104
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,120
i need to do what
 

1105
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,350
i need to do what
i need to have a value to save my value

1106
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
i need to have a value to save my value
 

1107
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,110
i need to have a value to save my value
equals

1108
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
equals
 

1109
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,230
equals
i want to save the value why

1110
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240
i want to save the value why
 

1111
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,870
i want to save the value why
save the parent at current x i want this

1112
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
save the parent at current x i want this
 

1113
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,190
save the parent at current x i want this
this is the parent x value

1114
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
this is the parent x value
 

1115
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,510
this is the parent x value
and then i've had an x

1116
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
and then i've had an x
 

1117
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,029
and then i've had an x
parent x i want to shave to p x right

1118
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
parent x i want to shave to p x right
 

1119
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,430
parent x i want to shave to p x right
i know what x will be v equals to v

1120
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
i know what x will be v equals to v
 

1121
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,549
i know what x will be v equals to v
right

1122
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
right
 

1123
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,750
right
yeah

1124
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:39,760
yeah
 

1125
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,630
yeah
and then

1126
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640
and then
 

1127
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,630
and then
finally i will i want to return the loop

1128
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
finally i will i want to return the loop
 

1129
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,710
finally i will i want to return the loop
which one is the root which value is the

1130
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720
which one is the root which value is the
 

1131
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,350
which one is the root which value is the
root

1132
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,360

 

1133
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,710

come on

1134
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
come on
 

1135
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,230
come on
which one is the root we're trying to

1136
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
which one is the root we're trying to
 

1137
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,950
which one is the root we're trying to
find out

1138
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960

 

1139
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,870

so here is that when we are not reaching

1140
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:56,880
so here is that when we are not reaching
 

1141
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,990
so here is that when we are not reaching
the

1142
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,000
the
 

1143
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,310
the
when we following these we

1144
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320
when we following these we
 

1145
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,310
when we following these we
point this is to compress the path

1146
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,320
point this is to compress the path
 

1147
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,750
point this is to compress the path
parent x

1148
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:03,760
parent x
 

1149
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,310
parent x
i want to point to the px here yeah this

1150
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:06,320
i want to point to the px here yeah this
 

1151
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,390
i want to point to the px here yeah this
this is what i mean and like x will go

1152
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
this is what i mean and like x will go
 

1153
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,510
this is what i mean and like x will go
to the

1154
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
to the
 

1155
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,510
to the
b which is parallax

1156
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
b which is parallax
 

1157
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,630
b which is parallax
okay so this is the recursion version of

1158
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640
okay so this is the recursion version of
 

1159
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,870
okay so this is the recursion version of
the previous one okay so once we have

1160
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
the previous one okay so once we have
 

1161
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,430
the previous one okay so once we have
this parent find parent yeah all right

1162
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,440
this parent find parent yeah all right
 

1163
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,350
this parent find parent yeah all right
we talk about fine parent and how can we

1164
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,360
we talk about fine parent and how can we
 

1165
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,510
we talk about fine parent and how can we
talk about uh check if the same group

1166
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
talk about uh check if the same group
 

1167
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,630
talk about uh check if the same group
come on

1168
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:24,640
come on
 

1169
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,149
come on
same group how can we check the same

1170
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
same group how can we check the same
 

1171
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:26,950
same group how can we check the same
group

1172
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
group
 

1173
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,310
group
a and b

1174
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:30,320

 

1175
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,549

how do we check if a and b belongs to

1176
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559
how do we check if a and b belongs to
 

1177
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,830
how do we check if a and b belongs to
the sample

1178
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:33,840
the sample
 

1179
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,510
the sample

yeah it's the same yeah
 

1347
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,909
yeah it's the same yeah
yeah it's the same thing yeah

1348
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
yeah it's the same thing yeah
 

1349
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:12,789
yeah it's the same thing yeah
but

1350
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:12,799
but
 

1351
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,870
but
we want to improve this

1352
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880
we want to improve this
 

1353
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,110
we want to improve this
why because look

1354
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
why because look
 

1355
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,470
why because look
look

1356
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
look
 

1357
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,230
look
which one is better if if they are

1358
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,240
which one is better if if they are
 

1359
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,510
which one is better if if they are
already too many if they are look okay

1360
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
already too many if they are look okay
 

1361
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,789
already too many if they are look okay
just imagine if this is a minion group a

1362
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:26,799
just imagine if this is a minion group a
 

1363
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,029
just imagine if this is a minion group a
group has a minion note right

1364
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,039
group has a minion note right
 

1365
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,029
group has a minion note right
yeah

1366
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:31,039
yeah
 

1367
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,990
yeah
and there's a group of just two notes

1368
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,000
and there's a group of just two notes
 

1369
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,350
and there's a group of just two notes
okay

1370
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:35,360
okay
 

1371
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,470
okay
yeah

1372
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
yeah
 

1373
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,950
yeah
and i want to merge these two notes two

1374
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:38,960
and i want to merge these two notes two
 

1375
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,269
and i want to merge these two notes two
groups

1376
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:41,279
groups
 

1377
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,510
groups
i want to match the two groups which one

1378
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:43,520
i want to match the two groups which one
 

1379
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,389
i want to match the two groups which one
is better moving this

1380
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:46,399
is better moving this
 

1381
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,310
is better moving this
which one is better eric

1382
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
which one is better eric
 

1383
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,830
which one is better eric
come on think about it this is a

1384
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840
come on think about it this is a
 

1385
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,430
come on think about it this is a
question

1386
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
question
 

1387
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,710
question
okay i have a group a has a minion note

1388
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
okay i have a group a has a minion note
 

1389
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,669
okay i have a group a has a minion note
i have a group b which is just two notes

1390
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:57,679
i have a group b which is just two notes
 

1391
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,070
i have a group b which is just two notes
i want to merge these two groups

1392
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
i want to merge these two groups
 

1393
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,950
i want to merge these two groups
so

1394
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
so
 

1395
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,950
so
should i set these

1396
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
should i set these
 

1397
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,110
should i set these
the parent of these the root at the

1398
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,120
the parent of these the root at the
 

1399
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,870
the parent of these the root at the
beginning is pointer is that can i

1400
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:06,880
beginning is pointer is that can i
 

1401
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,110
beginning is pointer is that can i
should i set these to

1402
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
should i set these to
 

1403
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,310
should i set these to
these this is one way merge the b to a

1404
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,320
these this is one way merge the b to a
 

1405
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,389
these this is one way merge the b to a
or should i say least

1406
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399
or should i say least
 

1407
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,510
or should i say least
like this is a loop to to to the root of

1408
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
like this is a loop to to to the root of
 

1409
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,590
like this is a loop to to to the root of
it which one is better b

1410
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,600
it which one is better b
 

1411
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,789
it which one is better b
b to a and and you

1412
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
b to a and and you
 

1413
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,909
b to a and and you
i think

1414
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:23,919
i think
 

1415
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,190
i think
you don't care okay b

1416
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,200

 

1417
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,789

actually

1418
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
actually
 

1419
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,830
actually
yeah this is oh any of these is okay but

1420
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:31,840
yeah this is oh any of these is okay but
 

1421
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,110
yeah this is oh any of these is okay but
it's better to make b to a yeah

1422
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
it's better to make b to a yeah
 

1423
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,830
it's better to make b to a yeah
yeah b to a i said i don't mind yeah

1424
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,840
yeah b to a i said i don't mind yeah
 

1425
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,389
yeah b to a i said i don't mind yeah
okay but i explained why merging the b

1426
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
okay but i explained why merging the b
 

1427
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,830
okay but i explained why merging the b
to a is better

1428
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:41,840
to a is better
 

1429
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,510
to a is better
can cannot tell me why imagine the b two

1430
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:43,520
can cannot tell me why imagine the b two
 

1431
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,750
can cannot tell me why imagine the b two
eight is better do you have that you're

1432
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
eight is better do you have that you're
 

1433
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,870
eight is better do you have that you're
less yeah

1434
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:46,880
less yeah
 

1435
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,950
less yeah
we want to merge the less

1436
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:48,960
we want to merge the less
 

1437
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,590
we want to merge the less
the size the set the group of less size

1438
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
the size the set the group of less size
 

1439
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,990
the size the set the group of less size
to the bigger size because in this case

1440
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,000
to the bigger size because in this case
 

1441
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,470
to the bigger size because in this case
we are not into we are not increasingly

1442
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480
we are not into we are not increasingly
 

1443
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,750
we are not into we are not increasingly
over all parts right if if we move these

1444
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
over all parts right if if we move these
 

1445
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,389
over all parts right if if we move these
to here what happened to all these parts

1446
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:02,399
to here what happened to all these parts
 

1447
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,190
to here what happened to all these parts
that these will be more one more right

1448
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,200
that these will be more one more right
 

1449
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,350
that these will be more one more right
okay because i have a minion nose i need

1450
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,360
okay because i have a minion nose i need
 

1451
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,269
okay because i have a minion nose i need
to affect a minion pass

1452
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,279
to affect a minion pass
 

1453
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,350
to affect a minion pass
right if i

1454
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,360
right if i
 

1455
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,190
right if i
these note will be effective when i

1456
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
these note will be effective when i
 

1457
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,789
these note will be effective when i
could release these snow will be

1458
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
could release these snow will be
 

1459
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,269
could release these snow will be
affected remember yeah i want to shorten

1460
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
affected remember yeah i want to shorten
 

1461
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,830
affected remember yeah i want to shorten
the path i want to shorten the path

1462
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:19,840
the path i want to shorten the path
 

1463
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,909
the path i want to shorten the path
yeah i don't want i i want to compress

1464
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:21,919
yeah i don't want i i want to compress
 

1465
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,470
yeah i don't want i i want to compress
this part right by when this moves in

1466
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:24,480
this part right by when this moves in
 

1467
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,230
this part right by when this moves in
the bigger thicker set to the smaller

1468
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:26,240
the bigger thicker set to the smaller
 

1469
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,710
the bigger thicker set to the smaller
cell what happened

1470
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
cell what happened
 

1471
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,190
cell what happened
all these nodes will be affected

1472
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
all these nodes will be affected
 

1473
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,510
all these nodes will be affected
if i move this the smaller set to these

1474
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,520
if i move this the smaller set to these
 

1475
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,789
if i move this the smaller set to these
all these

1476
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:34,799
all these
 

1477
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,430
all these
majority of this path

1478
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:37,440
majority of this path
 

1479
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,070
majority of this path
will not be affected only it less okay

1480
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
will not be affected only it less okay
 

1481
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,190
will not be affected only it less okay
so in order to do this we need to we can

1482
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
so in order to do this we need to we can
 

1483
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,710
so in order to do this we need to we can
have these sizes okay we can have size

1484
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:46,720
have these sizes okay we can have size
 

1485
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,669
have these sizes okay we can have size
at the beginning equals uh one times n

1486
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
at the beginning equals uh one times n
 

1487
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,710
at the beginning equals uh one times n
right

1488
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:50,720
right
 

1489
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,350
right
we have a size of each group right

1490
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360
we have a size of each group right
 

1491
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,669
we have a size of each group right
we have size of each screw and when we

1492
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:55,679
we have size of each screw and when we
 

1493
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,070
we have size of each screw and when we
merge it which first of all we check the

1494
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
merge it which first of all we check the
 

1495
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,710
merge it which first of all we check the
size which size which size is smaller

1496
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:00,720
size which size which size is smaller
 

1497
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,029
size which size which size is smaller
right we which size bigger we can we can

1498
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
right we which size bigger we can we can
 

1499
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,669
right we which size bigger we can we can
compare this if size a

1500
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:05,679
compare this if size a
 

1501
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,789
compare this if size a
if size a is smaller than if size b then

1502
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:10,799
if size a is smaller than if size b then
 

1503
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,510
if size a is smaller than if size b then
we merge the b uh

1504
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:13,520
we merge the b uh
 

1505
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,750
we merge the b uh
a to b otherwise we'll merge the b to a

1506
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
a to b otherwise we'll merge the b to a
 

1507
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,590
a to b otherwise we'll merge the b to a
right okay i'm not going to write it but

1508
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:17,600
right okay i'm not going to write it but
 

1509
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,510
right okay i'm not going to write it but
you understand this problem right we

1510
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:19,520
you understand this problem right we
 

1511
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,430
you understand this problem right we
want to merge the smaller size to the

1512
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:21,440
want to merge the smaller size to the
 

1513
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,669
want to merge the smaller size to the
bigger size and we updated the size size

1514
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:23,679
bigger size and we updated the size size
 

1515
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,070
bigger size and we updated the size size
x well self-doubt

1516
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,080
x well self-doubt
 

1517
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,630
x well self-doubt
size group a plus

1518
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:28,640
size group a plus
 

1519
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,950
size group a plus
equals sine square b all

1520
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
equals sine square b all
 

1521
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,110
equals sine square b all
set of the size group b plus equals

1522
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,120
set of the size group b plus equals
 

1523
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,950
set of the size group b plus equals
seven so size eight in this case we

1524
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:34,960
seven so size eight in this case we
 

1525
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,149
seven so size eight in this case we
always maintaining always merging the

1526
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
always maintaining always merging the
 

1527
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,070
always maintaining always merging the
set with smaller size into the bigger

1528
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
set with smaller size into the bigger
 

1529
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,590
set with smaller size into the bigger
one okay so when we

1530
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:43,600
one okay so when we
 

1531
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,789
one okay so when we
uh

1532
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
uh
 

1533
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,389
uh
when we when we merge the size yeah we

1534
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:48,399
when we when we merge the size yeah we
 

1535
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,830
when we when we merge the size yeah we
will merge the group what happened to

1536
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:49,840
will merge the group what happened to
 

1537
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,950
will merge the group what happened to
the uh

1538
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:50,960
the uh
 

1539
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,909
the uh
group

1540
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:51,919
group
 

1541
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,630
group
group count all right okay it's almost

1542
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:54,640
group count all right okay it's almost
 

1543
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,310
group count all right okay it's almost
going to be

1544
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
going to be
 

1545
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,549
going to be
complete okay so look

1546
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:58,559
complete okay so look
 

1547
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,149
complete okay so look

two
 

1553
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,389
two
three there are four groups okay

1554
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:04,399
three there are four groups okay
 

1555
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,350
three there are four groups okay
yeah

1556
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,360
yeah
 

1557
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,269
yeah
if i merge two groups how many groups

1558
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
if i merge two groups how many groups
 

1559
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,470
if i merge two groups how many groups
are there three if i move one one group

1560
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:10,480
are there three if i move one one group
 

1561
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,789
are there three if i move one one group
another another what happened to the

1562
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
another another what happened to the
 

1563
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,350
another another what happened to the
group count

1564
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,360

 

1565
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,350

every time i merge two individual

1566
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,360
every time i merge two individual
 

1567
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,870
every time i merge two individual
components what happened to the group of

1568
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:18,880
components what happened to the group of
 

1569
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,909
components what happened to the group of
total groups

1570
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:21,919

 

1571
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,269

minus two

1572
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:23,279
minus two
 

1573
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,269
minus two
now there are four groups i mean these

1574
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:25,279
now there are four groups i mean these
 

1575
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,509
now there are four groups i mean these
two how many goals

1576
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:27,519
two how many goals
 

1577
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,310
two how many goals
three yeah so why you said minus two

1578
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,320
three yeah so why you said minus two
 

1579
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,269
three yeah so why you said minus two
minus one minus one okay so i have i can

1580
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:33,279
minus one minus one okay so i have i can
 

1581
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,549
minus one minus one okay so i have i can
i can have two yeah yeah i can have a

1582
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,559
i can have two yeah yeah i can have a
 

1583
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,630
i can have two yeah yeah i can have a
connected count and every time i merge

1584
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:38,640
connected count and every time i merge
 

1585
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,269
connected count and every time i merge
it yeah in the merge function i if i if

1586
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:41,279
it yeah in the merge function i if i if
 

1587
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,430
it yeah in the merge function i if i if
they are not belonging to the same group

1588
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,440
they are not belonging to the same group
 

1589
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,669
they are not belonging to the same group
i merge it yeah i i mark working so what

1590
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:45,679
i merge it yeah i i mark working so what
 

1591
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,350
i merge it yeah i i mark working so what
happened to a good crop i can take the

1592
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,360
happened to a good crop i can take the
 

1593
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,830
happened to a good crop i can take the
coupon minus one right i can say the

1594
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:49,840
coupon minus one right i can say the
 

1595
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,750
coupon minus one right i can say the
groupon minus one and then i can have a

1596
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:51,760
groupon minus one and then i can have a
 

1597
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,870
groupon minus one and then i can have a
function i can have a function to to

1598
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:54,880
function i can have a function to to
 

1599
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,950
function i can have a function to to
yeah i can have a function to return the

1600
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
yeah i can have a function to return the
 

1601
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,669
yeah i can have a function to return the
number of groups okay so this is the

1602
00:31:59,669 --> 00:31:59,679
number of groups okay so this is the
 

1603
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,110
number of groups okay so this is the
uh another function okay i think

1604
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
uh another function okay i think
 

1605
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,870
uh another function okay i think
i think this is okay so how many

1606
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:04,880
i think this is okay so how many
 

1607
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,870
i think this is okay so how many
functions for these two uh this joint

1608
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
functions for these two uh this joint
 

1609
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,830
functions for these two uh this joint

notice we only merge the group we talk
 

1671
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,430
notice we only merge the group we talk
about much the smaller one to smaller

1672
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,440
about much the smaller one to smaller
 

1673
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,549
about much the smaller one to smaller
one to the bigger one yeah

1674
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:30,559
one to the bigger one yeah
 

1675
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,710
one to the bigger one yeah
same group same guru just calling the

1676
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
same group same guru just calling the
 

1677
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,870
same group same guru just calling the
fine parent to to find out if the five

1678
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:34,880
fine parent to to find out if the five
 

1679
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,269
fine parent to to find out if the five
parent x is the same as five percent

1680
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:37,279
parent x is the same as five percent
 

1681
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,509
parent x is the same as five percent
right but if i want to know

1682
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:39,519
right but if i want to know
 

1683
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,470
right but if i want to know
how many groups are there right

1684
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,480
how many groups are there right
 

1685
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,950
how many groups are there right
number of groups yeah how many of them

1686
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:44,960
number of groups yeah how many of them
 

1687
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,549
number of groups yeah how many of them
how can we implement this we just keep a

1688
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:46,559
how can we implement this we just keep a
 

1689
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,470
how can we implement this we just keep a
counter

1690
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,480
counter
 

1691
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,110
counter
number of groups yeah at the beginning

1692
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,120
number of groups yeah at the beginning
 

1693
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,830
number of groups yeah at the beginning
they are angles yeah you know in uh

1694
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:53,840
they are angles yeah you know in uh
 

1695
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,909
they are angles yeah you know in uh
at the beginning is their angles every

1696
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
at the beginning is their angles every
 

1697
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,310
at the beginning is their angles every
time we merge merge two things if they

1698
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
time we merge merge two things if they
 

1699
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,830
time we merge merge two things if they
don't belong the same group what

1700
00:33:59,830 --> 00:33:59,840
don't belong the same group what
 

1701
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,870
don't belong the same group what
happened we minus minus minus equals one

1702
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:02,880
happened we minus minus minus equals one
 

1703
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,789
happened we minus minus minus equals one
yeah correct we minus equals one right

1704
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:06,799
yeah correct we minus equals one right
 

1705
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,030
yeah correct we minus equals one right
okay

1706
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,040
okay
 

1707
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,430

okay so we talk about the disjoint uh

1708
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:11,440
okay so we talk about the disjoint uh
 

1709
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,510
okay so we talk about the disjoint uh
this concept okay let's go back to that

1710
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:13,520
this concept okay let's go back to that
 

1711
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,750
this concept okay let's go back to that
original problem okay and that's it

1712
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:17,760

 

1713
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:25,030

a graph

1714
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,040

 

1715
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,790

the graph

1716
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:26,800
the graph
 

1717
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,869
the graph
the edges we won't find out if there's

1718
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:28,879
the edges we won't find out if there's
 

1719
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,190
the edges we won't find out if there's
stuff like the path from start to end

1720
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,200
stuff like the path from start to end
 

1721
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,629
stuff like the path from start to end
okay

1722
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:36,639

 

1723
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,270

exists remember past exists and that's

1724
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:39,280
exists remember past exists and that's
 

1725
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,349
exists remember past exists and that's
the edges

1726
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:41,359
the edges
 

1727
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,069
the edges
edges

1728
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:44,079

 

1729
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,589

okay look

1730
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:45,599
okay look
 

1731
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,510
okay look
first of all i have a discharge set okay

1732
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
first of all i have a discharge set okay
 

1733
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,030
first of all i have a discharge set okay
let's say you dijon set d s equals

1734
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,040
let's say you dijon set d s equals
 

1735
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,510
let's say you dijon set d s equals
disjoint set

1736
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:53,520
disjoint set
 

1737
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,389
disjoint set
disjoint

1738
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:56,399

 

1739
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,510

set and there are n and edges yeah

1740
00:34:59,510 --> 00:34:59,520
set and there are n and edges yeah
 

1741
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,270
set and there are n and edges yeah
n equals length

1742
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:01,280
n equals length
 

1743
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,190
n equals length
edges or whatever yeah

1744
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,200
edges or whatever yeah
 

1745
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,670
edges or whatever yeah
okay now for

1746
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:05,680
okay now for
 

1747
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,790
okay now for
star

1748
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:06,800
star
 

1749
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,670
star
and

1750
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:07,680
and
 

1751
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,589
and
in edges

1752
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:11,599

 

1753
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,750

so what happened here i have a start

1754
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
so what happened here i have a start
 

1755
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,270
so what happened here i have a start
remember at the beginning i talked about

1756
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:15,280
remember at the beginning i talked about
 

1757
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,870
remember at the beginning i talked about
zero to one there is an edge between

1758
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:16,880
zero to one there is an edge between
 

1759
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,310
zero to one there is an edge between
zero to one what happened what should i

1760
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:18,320
zero to one what happened what should i
 

1761
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,390
zero to one what happened what should i
do with these what should i do

1762
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,400
do with these what should i do
 

1763
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,750
do with these what should i do
considering the edges

1764
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:23,760

 

1765
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,790

at the beginning there are n edges and

1766
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:26,800
at the beginning there are n edges and
 

1767
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,310
at the beginning there are n edges and
not

1768
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:28,320
not
 

1769
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,150
not
and i found out if there edge between

1770
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,160
and i found out if there edge between
 

1771
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,190
and i found out if there edge between
zero to one what happened

1772
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,200
zero to one what happened
 

1773
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,990
zero to one what happened
d s dot what which which function we're

1774
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,000
d s dot what which which function we're
 

1775

going to
 

1777
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,710
going to
make these two

1778
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:38,720
make these two
 

1779
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,510
make these two
come on we talk about a few functions

1780
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:41,520
come on we talk about a few functions
 

1781
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,870
come on we talk about a few functions
what

1782
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:42,880
what
 

1783
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:52,310
what
um

1784
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,320

 

1785
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,030

this is s this e

1786
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
this is s this e
 

1787
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,190
this is s this e
and we want to find out if there

1788
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,200
and we want to find out if there
 

1789
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,870
and we want to find out if there
any there's a lesser uh star

1790
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
any there's a lesser uh star
 

1791
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,710
any there's a lesser uh star
unless uh two yeah uh

1792
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:04,720
unless uh two yeah uh

1796
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:09,359
two okay so now we just need to find out
 

1797
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,430
two okay so now we just need to find out
if there are paths between start two so

1798
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:11,440
if there are paths between start two so
 

1799
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,910
if there are paths between start two so
which function ds dot 1

1800

this john said what what function should

1814
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:28,560
this john said what what function should
 

1815
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,670
this john said what what function should
we call

1816
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:29,680
we call
 

1817
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,150
we call
to find out if there are two elements

1818
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,160
to find out if there are two elements
 

1819
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,870
to find out if there are two elements
belongs to same group right

1820
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:34,880
belongs to same group right
 

1821
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,109
belongs to same group right
so this is same group

1822
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:41,119

 

1823
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:41,910

yeah

1824
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:41,920
yeah
 

1825
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,870
yeah
you see

1826
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:42,880
you see
 

1827
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,910
you see
so this one is it look

1828
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:45,920
so this one is it look
 

1829
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,990
so this one is it look
no no no wait wait wait

1830
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,000
no no no wait wait wait
 

1831
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,550
no no no wait wait wait
so remember before we use the definition

1832
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:50,560
so remember before we use the definition
 

1833
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,950
so remember before we use the definition
first buff we study strong set look how

1834
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:52,960
first buff we study strong set look how
 

1835
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,710
first buff we study strong set look how
simple it is yeah

1836
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:54,720
simple it is yeah
 

1837
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,630
simple it is yeah
the implementation is single right i'm

1838
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:56,640
the implementation is single right i'm
 

1839
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,990
the implementation is single right i'm
right 36 yeah do you understand

1840
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
right 36 yeah do you understand
 

1841
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,069
right 36 yeah do you understand
37 that's okay what's the time

1842
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:02,079
37 that's okay what's the time
 

1843
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,230
37 that's okay what's the time
complexity of the

1844
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,240
complexity of the
 

1845
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,470
complexity of the
digital set normally

1846
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,480
digital set normally
 

1847
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,109
digital set normally
which function which function yeah the

1848
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:11,119
which function which function yeah the
 

1849
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,430
which function which function yeah the
fine the file in the worst case if

1850
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:13,440
fine the file in the worst case if
 

1851
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,430
fine the file in the worst case if
you're not compressing the path the to

1852
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:15,440
you're not compressing the path the to
 

1853
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,750
you're not compressing the path the to
find the parent takes ln right but

1854
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:17,760
find the parent takes ln right but
 

1855
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,670
find the parent takes ln right but
usually if you compress the path in

1856
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:19,680
usually if you compress the path in
 

1857
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,589
usually if you compress the path in
practical uses it's not just one

1858
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:21,599
practical uses it's not just one
 

1859
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,390
practical uses it's not just one
constant right and then merge merge is

1860
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,400
constant right and then merge merge is
 

1861
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,630
constant right and then merge merge is
simple or one right we just assign one

1862
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:26,640
simple or one right we just assign one
 

1863
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,990
simple or one right we just assign one
to another right

1864
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,000
to another right
 

1865
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,069
to another right
because it fundamentally causes the fine

1866
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:30,079
because it fundamentally causes the fine
 

1867
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,230
because it fundamentally causes the fine
parents and then what

1868
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,240
parents and then what
 

1869
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,310
parents and then what
check check the same group yeah they're

1870
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,320
check check the same group yeah they're
 

1871
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,150
check check the same group yeah they're
calling the five parent

1872
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,160
calling the five parent
 

1873
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,270
calling the five parent
and

1874
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:37,280
and
 

1875
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,710
and
what else

1876
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:38,720
what else
 

1877
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,630
what else
nothing yeah nothing

1878
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:40,640
nothing yeah nothing
 

1879
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,190
nothing yeah nothing
okay so this is o n okay the time space

1880
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,200
okay so this is o n okay the time space
 

1881
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,109
okay so this is o n okay the time space
complexity is also o m because there are

1882
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:45,119
complexity is also o m because there are
 

1883
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,230
complexity is also o m because there are
n eighties no n notes and we n groups

1884
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,240
n eighties no n notes and we n groups
 

1885
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,589
n eighties no n notes and we n groups
yeah we need strong set to to store the

1886
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:51,599
yeah we need strong set to to store the
 

1887
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,670
yeah we need strong set to to store the
uh we have a list to store the number of

1888
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:53,680
uh we have a list to store the number of
 

1889
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,190
uh we have a list to store the number of
the

1890
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,200
the
 

1891
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,349
the
the groups for you for for for each note

1892
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:57,359
the groups for you for for for each note
 

1893
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,510
the groups for you for for for each note
right okay okay that's it for today good

1894
00:37:59,510 --> 00:37:59,520
right okay okay that's it for today good
 

1895
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
right okay okay that's it for today good
