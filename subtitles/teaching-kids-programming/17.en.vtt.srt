00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,109
hello and so today we're talking about
mathematics not coding today

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
mathematics not coding today
 

9
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,830
mathematics not coding today
yeah we're going to talk about these

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,470

do you know what was introduction mean

14
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
do you know what was introduction mean
 

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,750
do you know what was introduction mean
instruction

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
instruction
 

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,510
instruction
no in the instruction induction

18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
no in the instruction induction
 

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,950
no in the instruction induction
okay you don't understand that's fine

20
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
okay you don't understand that's fine
 

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,029
okay you don't understand that's fine
okay so

22
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
okay so
 

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,590
okay so
so this is a powerful tool to prove that

24
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
so this is a powerful tool to prove that
 

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,389
so this is a powerful tool to prove that
prove uh formula if it's correct or not

26
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
prove uh formula if it's correct or not
 

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,029
prove uh formula if it's correct or not
right

28
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
right
 

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,469
right
so for example like if i want to know

30
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
so for example like if i want to know
 

31
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,390
so for example like if i want to know
look if f is the function yeah

32
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
look if f is the function yeah
 

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,590
look if f is the function yeah
f n is the function of the sum

34
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
f n is the function of the sum
 

35
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,550
f n is the function of the sum
for the first and natural numbers you

36
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
for the first and natural numbers you
 

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,870
for the first and natural numbers you
know what's like natural numbers

38
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880

 

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,070

174
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
that ryan ryan please
 

175
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,909
that ryan ryan please
if i tell you that f n

176
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
if i tell you that f n
 

177
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,950
if i tell you that f n
is n times n plus one divided by two

178
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
is n times n plus one divided by two
 

179
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,670
is n times n plus one divided by two
yeah

180
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
yeah
 

181
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,430
yeah
okay so we need to do two steps to prove

182
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
okay so we need to do two steps to prove
 

183
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,590
okay so we need to do two steps to prove
that this is correct how do we do it so

184
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
that this is correct how do we do it so
 

185
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,710
that this is correct how do we do it so
first of all we ask

186
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
first of all we ask
 

187
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,150
first of all we ask
when n is one so what's the answer

188
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
when n is one so what's the answer
 

189
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,189
when n is one so what's the answer
one yes right

190
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
one yes right
 

191
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,950
one yes right
can you quite comfortable and one times

192
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
can you quite comfortable and one times
 

193
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,990
can you quite comfortable and one times
two two divided by two

194
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
two two divided by two
 

195
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,430
two two divided by two
one right yeah okay so when n

196
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
one right yeah okay so when n
 

197
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,430
one right yeah okay so when n
is one the base case we call it base

198
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
is one the base case we call it base
 

199
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,510
is one the base case we call it base
case because n equals minimum is

200
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
case because n equals minimum is
 

201
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,870
case because n equals minimum is
n is one then and the answer

202
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
n is one then and the answer
 

203
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,909
n is one then and the answer
is one right

204
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
is one right
 

205
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,510
is one right
okay so now if look

206
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
okay so now if look
 

207
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,110
okay so now if look
ryan are you okay ryan

208
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
ryan are you okay ryan
 

209
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,469
ryan are you okay ryan
good boy okay on tv okay now look

210
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
good boy okay on tv okay now look
 

211
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,749
good boy okay on tv okay now look
if n is look if if we talk

212
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
if n is look if if we talk
 

213
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,790
if n is look if if we talk
uh if we assume that

214
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
uh if we assume that
 

215
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,870
uh if we assume that
n is k right f k is equal to

216
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
n is k right f k is equal to
 

217
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,309
n is k right f k is equal to
just any any number okay k equals okay

218
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
just any any number okay k equals okay
 

219
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,990
just any any number okay k equals okay
did you say k equals a k plus one

220
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
did you say k equals a k plus one
 

221
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,469
did you say k equals a k plus one
divided by two okay

222
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479

 

223
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,469

okay okay okay so if fk equals k plus

224
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
okay okay okay so if fk equals k plus
 

225
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,790
okay okay okay so if fk equals k plus
yeah

226
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
yeah
 

227
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,510
yeah
if k is the same as that yeah yeah now

228
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
if k is the same as that yeah yeah now
 

229
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,950
if k is the same as that yeah yeah now
then when you're in the end

230
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
then when you're in the end
 

231
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,990
then when you're in the end
what's kfk plus one what's the answer of

232
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
what's kfk plus one what's the answer of
 

233
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,189
what's kfk plus one what's the answer of
k-power

234
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
k-power
 

235
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,790
k-power
f k-power is it equals to f k

236
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
f k-power is it equals to f k
 

237
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,909
f k-power is it equals to f k
plus k plus 1 right am right because

238
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
plus k plus 1 right am right because
 

239
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,070
plus k plus 1 right am right because
now i got the sum of the first k numbers

240
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
now i got the sum of the first k numbers
 

241
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,710
now i got the sum of the first k numbers
i i just need to add one more right

242
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
i i just need to add one more right
 

243
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,909
i i just need to add one more right
yes yes you just had one not k at one

plus five right am right

250
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
plus five right am right
 

251
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,629
plus five right am right
at the yeah f5

252
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
at the yeah f5
 

253
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,710
at the yeah f5
yeah f5 is supposed to be x k

254
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
yeah f5 is supposed to be x k
 

255
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,749
yeah f5 is supposed to be x k
no k plus one look k is four then

256
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
no k plus one look k is four then
 

257
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,469
no k plus one look k is four then
k plus one is five that's what i mean

258
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
k plus one is five that's what i mean

mean much shorter so this is the junior
 

267
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,189
mean much shorter so this is the junior
case shorter than fk

268
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
case shorter than fk
 

269
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,350
case shorter than fk
why no i'm just saying this is an

270

okay general case general case yes yeah
okay so now f k equals f k

276
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
okay so now f k equals f k
 

277
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,670
okay so now f k equals f k
f k plus one equals f k plus k plus one

278
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
f k plus one equals f k plus k plus one
 

279
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,029
f k plus one equals f k plus k plus one
right

280
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
right
 

281
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,830

plus k plus one right this is the k plus

296
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
plus k plus one right this is the k plus
 

297
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,830
plus k plus one right this is the k plus
one portion

298
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
one portion
 

299
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,830

this is k k plus one divided by two

302
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
this is k k plus one divided by two
 

303
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,909
this is k k plus one divided by two
right

304
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
right
 

305
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,950
right
yeah yeah we know that right

yeah yeah we know that right
 

307
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,909
yeah yeah we know that right
so this is k plus one what can we do

308
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
so this is k plus one what can we do
 

309
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,990
so this is k plus one what can we do
about it we can do it is 2

310
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
about it we can do it is 2
 

311
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,469
about it we can do it is 2
2 k password is the same thing yeah all

312
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
2 k password is the same thing yeah all
 

313
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,029
2 k password is the same thing yeah all
right

314
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
right
 

315
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,790
right
yeah okay so now if we merge these two

316
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
yeah okay so now if we merge these two
 

317
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,909
yeah okay so now if we merge these two
how can we merge these two emergency two

318
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
how can we merge these two emergency two
 

319
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,670
how can we merge these two emergency two
loops that over twos right i was like 2

320
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
loops that over twos right i was like 2
 

321
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,230
loops that over twos right i was like 2
here

322
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
here
 

323
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,070
here
so k k plus 1 plus 2

324
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
so k k plus 1 plus 2
 

325
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,389
so k k plus 1 plus 2
k plus 1 right am right yes

326
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
k plus 1 right am right yes
 

327
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,949
k plus 1 right am right yes
look there this command here k plus 1

328
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
look there this command here k plus 1
 

329
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:37,430
look there this command here k plus 1
right

330
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
right
 

331
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,469
right
so it equals 2 k at two

332
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
so it equals 2 k at two
 

333
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,430
so it equals 2 k at two
k plus one and then k f two yes we're

334
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
k plus one and then k f two yes we're
 

335
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,829
k plus one and then k f two yes we're
done

336
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
done
 

337
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,949
done
okay yeah okay so look

338
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
okay yeah okay so look
 

339
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,910
okay yeah okay so look
at that look look wait wait so what's

340
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
at that look look wait wait so what's
 

341
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,310
at that look look wait wait so what's
next

342
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
next
 

343
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,949
next
look magic this is magic look why

344
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
look magic this is magic look why
 

345
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,389
look magic this is magic look why
look look this is magic look so this k

346
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
look look this is magic look so this k
 

347
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,990
look look this is magic look so this k
plus 2 equals k plus 1 plus 1 right

348
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
plus 2 equals k plus 1 plus 1 right
 

349
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,550
plus 2 equals k plus 1 plus 1 right
plus 1 yes yes

350
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560

 

351
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,150

k plus

352
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160

 

353
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,430

i know look k plus one k plus one

354
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
i know look k plus one k plus one
 

355
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,630
i know look k plus one k plus one
k plus one so if i

356
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
k plus one so if i
 

357
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,870
k plus one so if i
if i say t equals k plus one so i can do

358
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
if i say t equals k plus one so i can do
 

359
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,990
if i say t equals k plus one so i can do
f t equals t times

360
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
f t equals t times
 

361
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,150
f t equals t times
t plus one divided by two you see

362
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
t plus one divided by two you see
 

363
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,030
t plus one divided by two you see
do you see this it's the same i can't

364
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
do you see this it's the same i can't
 

365
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,590
do you see this it's the same i can't
see

366
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
see
 

367
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,790
see
it okay do you see so what what

368
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
it okay do you see so what what
 

369
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,870
it okay do you see so what what
so what does it mean what does it mean

370
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
so what does it mean what does it mean
 

371
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,750
so what does it mean what does it mean
what does it mean we we prove that the

372
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
what does it mean we we prove that the
 

373
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,550
what does it mean we we prove that the
base case

374
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
base case
 

375
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,750
base case
when k equals one

376
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
when k equals one
 

377
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,150
when k equals one
they form the proposition this formula

378
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
they form the proposition this formula
 

379
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,030
they form the proposition this formula
yeah

380
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
yeah
 

381
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,470
yeah
yeah is is correct right

382
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
yeah is is correct right
 

383
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,829
yeah is is correct right
we assume the kfk is correct

384
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
we assume the kfk is correct
 

385
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,870
we assume the kfk is correct
and then when we add one more item

386
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
and then when we add one more item
 

387
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,990
and then when we add one more item
yeah it will be the same yes

388
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
yeah it will be the same yes
 

389
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,110
yeah it will be the same yes
the formula is the same look so we prove

390
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
the formula is the same look so we prove
 

391
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,670
the formula is the same look so we prove
that this formula is correct this is

392
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
that this formula is correct this is
 

393
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,150
that this formula is correct this is
called

394
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160

sum of a square like that if i saw fk

408
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
sum of a square like that if i saw fk
 

409
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,590
sum of a square like that if i saw fk
equals 1 squared plus 2 squared

410
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
equals 1 squared plus 2 squared
 

411
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,350
equals 1 squared plus 2 squared
plus 3 squared plus k square

412
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
plus 3 squared plus k square
 

413
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,310
plus 3 squared plus k square
okay i tell you let this sum equals

414
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
okay i tell you let this sum equals
 

415
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,150
okay i tell you let this sum equals
n n plus 1 2 n plus one

416
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
n n plus 1 2 n plus one
 

417
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,350
n n plus 1 2 n plus one
yeah this is the formula that means k

418
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
yeah this is the formula that means k
 

419
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,550
yeah this is the formula that means k
is bigger than three now look can we say

420
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
is bigger than three now look can we say
 

421
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,590
is bigger than three now look can we say
the base cases

422
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
the base cases
 

423
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,350
the base cases
when k is one one k is one what's the

424
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
when k is one one k is one what's the
 

425
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,310
when k is one one k is one what's the
sum

426
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
sum
 

427
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,030
sum
it's one right yeah the first item so

428
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
it's one right yeah the first item so
 

429
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,630
it's one right yeah the first item so
let's see if it's one okay so

430
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
let's see if it's one okay so
 

431
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,230
let's see if it's one okay so
n is one k is one so one times

432
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
n is one k is one so one times
 

433
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,350
n is one k is one so one times
one plus one times two

434
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
one plus one times two
 

435
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,470
one plus one times two
times one plus one divided by six you

436
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:12,480
times one plus one divided by six you
 

437
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,470
times one plus one divided by six you
see one

438
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
see one
 

439
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,509
see one
one times two plus three two times

440
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
one times two plus three two times
 

441
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,630
one times two plus three two times
one two plus one three right

442
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
one two plus one three right
 

443
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,310
one two plus one three right
one times two times three six divided by

444
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
one times two times three six divided by
 

445
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,829
one times two times three six divided by
six

446
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
six
 

447
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,710
six
why is it divided by six this is the

448
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
why is it divided by six this is the
 

449
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,069
why is it divided by six this is the
formula preposition

450
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
formula preposition
 

451
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,750
formula preposition
yeah i just told you it's that and i

452
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
yeah i just told you it's that and i
 

453
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,670
yeah i just told you it's that and i
want you to prove that it's correct

454
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
want you to prove that it's correct
 

455
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,910
want you to prove that it's correct
so we prove we first of all improve

456
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
so we prove we first of all improve
 

457
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,509
so we prove we first of all improve
so we sorry so we

458
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
so we sorry so we
 

459
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,990
so we sorry so we
we prove that the 1k is one the base

460
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
we prove that the 1k is one the base
 

461
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,750
we prove that the 1k is one the base
case is correct right

462
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
case is correct right
 

463
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,430
case is correct right
yeah okay now if you're not sure

464
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
yeah okay now if you're not sure
 

465
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,590
yeah okay now if you're not sure
let look that one k is two what's the

466
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
let look that one k is two what's the
 

467
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,949
let look that one k is two what's the
answer

468
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
answer
 

469
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,069
answer
k is two um the same

470
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
k is two um the same
 

471
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,750
k is two um the same
one one squared plus two squared

472
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
one one squared plus two squared
 

473
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,110
one one squared plus two squared
one squared plus t squared that's

474
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
one squared plus t squared that's
 

475
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,470
one squared plus t squared that's
five yes five okay look

476
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
five yes five okay look
 

477
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,509
five yes five okay look
put a two here two times

478
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:09,519
put a two here two times
 

479
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,790
put a two here two times
two plus one times two times two plus

480
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
two plus one times two times two plus
 

481
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,269
two plus one times two times two plus
one

482
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
one
 

483
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,710
one
divided by six two times three

484
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
divided by six two times three
 

485
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,069
divided by six two times three
six okay so this is gone yeah two times

486
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
six okay so this is gone yeah two times
 

487
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,629
six okay so this is gone yeah two times
two plus one

488
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
two plus one
 

489
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,670
two plus one
five yeah yes so look k equals two is

490
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
five yeah yes so look k equals two is
 

491
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,790
five yeah yes so look k equals two is
also correct okay

492
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
also correct okay
 

493
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,590
also correct okay
so now let's let's prove it so we just

494
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
so now let's let's prove it so we just
 

495
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,470
so now let's let's prove it so we just
prove when

496
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
prove when
 

497
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,829
prove when
k is one the base case is correct

498
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
k is one the base case is correct
 

499
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,030
k is one the base case is correct
now we need to assume when

500
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
now we need to assume when
 

501
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,030
now we need to assume when
fk is correct and i will add one more

502
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
fk is correct and i will add one more
 

503
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,230
fk is correct and i will add one more
so one more so one more item

504
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
so one more so one more item
 

505
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,430
so one more so one more item
what's that it's k plus one right

506

mud on your feet f k plus
 

517
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,389
mud on your feet f k plus
k plus one square equals

518
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
k plus one square equals
 

519
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,150
k plus one square equals
six and six k

520
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
six and six k
 

521
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,230
six and six k
k plus one two k plus one

522
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
k plus one two k plus one
 

523
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,389
k plus one two k plus one
plus this item i also put a six

524
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
plus this item i also put a six
 

525
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,790
plus this item i also put a six
and i know becomes 6 k plus 1 square

526
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
and i know becomes 6 k plus 1 square
 

527
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,509
and i know becomes 6 k plus 1 square
right

528
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
right
 

529
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,949
right
yes all right so why i have 2

530
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
yes all right so why i have 2
 

531
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,590
yes all right so why i have 2
is because they are both over 6 so i can

532
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
is because they are both over 6 so i can
 

533
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,230
is because they are both over 6 so i can
merge these two items

534
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,240
merge these two items
 

535
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,310
merge these two items
so 6 and then now i have k

536
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
so 6 and then now i have k
 

537
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,470
so 6 and then now i have k
plus one k plus one here so i put a k

538
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
plus one k plus one here so i put a k
 

539
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,910
plus one k plus one here so i put a k
plus one

540
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
plus one
 

541
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,189
plus one
okay now this item will be k times

542
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
okay now this item will be k times
 

543
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,870
okay now this item will be k times
two k plus one right

544
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
two k plus one right
 

545
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,470
two k plus one right
plus is plus i take a plus

546
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480

 

547
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,389

plus what six k plus one okay

548
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:54,399
plus what six k plus one okay
 

549
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,670
plus what six k plus one okay
all right why didn't you do a square

550
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
all right why didn't you do a square
 

551
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,949
all right why didn't you do a square
which one square that where

552
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
which one square that where
 

553
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,230
which one square that where
this one yeah because i take the k plus

554
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
this one yeah because i take the k plus
 

555
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,870
this one yeah because i take the k plus
one out

556
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
one out
 

557
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,590
one out
they both have this k plus one yeah this

558
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
they both have this k plus one yeah this
 

559
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,550
they both have this k plus one yeah this
is called uh

560
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,560
is called uh
 

561
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,750
is called uh
look if a b plus

562
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
look if a b plus
 

563
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,949
look if a b plus
a c one you can convert it is

564
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
a c one you can convert it is
 

565
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,030
a c one you can convert it is
a b plus c yeah all right

566
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
a b plus c yeah all right
 

567
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,670
a b plus c yeah all right
look because they have both a i can take

568
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
look because they have both a i can take
 

569
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,389
look because they have both a i can take
it out

570
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
it out
 

571
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,509
it out
and then these two just update it

572
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
and then these two just update it
 

573
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,629
and then these two just update it
yeah add it together all right for

574
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
yeah add it together all right for
 

575
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,150
yeah add it together all right for
example two times five

576
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
example two times five
 

577
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,430
example two times five
plus two times three equals two times

578
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
plus two times three equals two times
 

579
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,150
plus two times three equals two times
five plus three right that's ten that's

580
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
five plus three right that's ten that's
 

581
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,550
five plus three right that's ten that's
six

582
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
six
 

583
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,670
six
sixteen two times eight

584
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
sixteen two times eight
 

585
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,710
sixteen two times eight
sixteen you see yeah

586
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720
sixteen you see yeah
 

587
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,829
sixteen you see yeah
still get it yeah okay so now

588
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
still get it yeah okay so now
 

589
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,189
still get it yeah okay so now
look sorry

590

so look this so
 

593
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,030
so look this so
coming through that it's correct look

594
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
coming through that it's correct look
 

595
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,389
coming through that it's correct look
this is

596
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
this is
 

597
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,710
this is
this is a bit complicated yeah this is

598
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
this is a bit complicated yeah this is
 

599
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,990
this is a bit complicated yeah this is
2k

600
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
2k
 

601
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,910
2k
square plus k right plus 6k

602
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
square plus k right plus 6k
 

603
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,350
square plus k right plus 6k
plus 6 okay so look

604
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
plus 6 okay so look
 

605
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,629
plus 6 okay so look
uh look so this is 2k

606
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
uh look so this is 2k
 

607
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,069
uh look so this is 2k
square plus 7k plus 6

608
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
square plus 7k plus 6
 

609
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,430
square plus 7k plus 6
right so this thing

610
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
right so this thing
 

611
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,870
right so this thing
is equal to

612
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880

 

613
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,990

it should be equal to what to uh

614
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
it should be equal to what to uh
 

615
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,670
it should be equal to what to uh
k plus 2

616
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680

 

617
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,150

times 2k

618
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160

 

619
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,189

plus 1 plus 1 okay so it should be this

620
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
plus 1 plus 1 okay so it should be this
 

621
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:37,910
plus 1 plus 1 okay so it should be this
way

622
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
way
 

623
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,110
way
so we prove is it we can do this 2

624
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
so we prove is it we can do this 2
 

625
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,230
so we prove is it we can do this 2
2 k plus 1 look it's k plus 2

626
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
2 k plus 1 look it's k plus 2
 

627
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,430
2 k plus 1 look it's k plus 2
2 k plus 2 plus 1

628
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
2 k plus 2 plus 1
 

629
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,629
2 k plus 2 plus 1
3 okay so it's it's it's the same

630
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
3 okay so it's it's it's the same
 

631
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,829
3 okay so it's it's it's the same
why is this the same

632
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:57,839

 

633
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,829

so here look yeah look

634
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
so here look yeah look
 

635
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,470
so here look yeah look
two k square plus three k

636
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
two k square plus three k
 

637
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,590
two k square plus three k
plus four k is seven k yeah seven k

638
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
plus four k is seven k yeah seven k
 

639
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,790
plus four k is seven k yeah seven k
plus one plus two and three plus six

640
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
plus one plus two and three plus six
 

641
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,030
plus one plus two and three plus six
so look these two items are equal so we

642
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
so look these two items are equal so we
 

643
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,069
so look these two items are equal so we
prove

644
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
prove
 

645
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,389
prove
that when k plus one because this is k

646
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
that when k plus one because this is k
 

647
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,509
that when k plus one because this is k
plus one we can

648
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
plus one we can
 

649
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,470
plus one we can
make it a t then you'll be the same as t

650
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
make it a t then you'll be the same as t
 

651
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,269
make it a t then you'll be the same as t
t plus one

652
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
t plus one
 

653
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,870
t plus one
two t plus one yeah easy

654
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
two t plus one yeah easy
 

655
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,990
two t plus one yeah easy
yeah i know i know so yeah okay

656
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
yeah i know i know so yeah okay
 

657
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,389
yeah i know i know so yeah okay
so this is called mass induction so to

658
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
so this is called mass induction so to
 

659
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,030
so this is called mass induction so to
sum up

660
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
sum up
 

661
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,470
sum up
we we need to do two steps

662
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:36,480
we we need to do two steps
 

663
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,749
we we need to do two steps
two steps first of all

664
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
two steps first of all
 

665
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,790
two steps first of all
first of all proof

666
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800

 

667
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,829

through base case okay base case

668
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839
through base case okay base case
 

669
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,069
through base case okay base case
remember

670
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
remember
 

671
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,350
remember
when one is sum yeah this sum of first

672
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
when one is sum yeah this sum of first
 

673
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,910
when one is sum yeah this sum of first
in

674
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
in
 

675
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,110
in
first n integers is when n is one

676
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
first n integers is when n is one
 

677
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,629
first n integers is when n is one
is the sum is one two

678
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
is the sum is one two
 

679
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,789
is the sum is one two
which is called induction step

680
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
which is called induction step
 

681
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,270
which is called induction step
so what does it mean so if we assume

682
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
so what does it mean so if we assume
 

683
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,990
so what does it mean so if we assume
when n

684
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
when n
 

685
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,750
when n
equals k the fn function

686
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
equals k the fn function
 

687
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,630
equals k the fn function
yeah fk function and then we need to add

688
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
yeah fk function and then we need to add
 

689
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,350
yeah fk function and then we need to add
one more

690
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
one more
 

691
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,390
one more
one more item f k plus k

692
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
one more item f k plus k
 

693
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,590
one more item f k plus k
plus one right this is one f k

694
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
plus one right this is one f k
 

695
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,789
plus one right this is one f k
plus one we can do this and then we need

696
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
plus one we can do this and then we need
 

697
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,510
plus one we can do this and then we need
to prove

698
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
to prove
 

699
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,950
to prove
this formula also

700
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
this formula also
 

701
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,230
this formula also
can be represented using this original

702
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
can be represented using this original
 

703
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,830
can be represented using this original
formula then we can approve this

704
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
formula then we can approve this
 

705
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,590
formula then we can approve this
formula instead do you get it okay

706
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
formula instead do you get it okay
 

707
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,029
formula instead do you get it okay
any questions so far no

708
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
any questions so far no
 

709
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:51,669
any questions so far no
bye bye bye-bye christmas toy

710
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679

 

711
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,280

oh yeah
