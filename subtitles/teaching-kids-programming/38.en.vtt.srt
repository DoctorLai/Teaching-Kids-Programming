00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,670
like if i give you a quid a list of
quidditch like three

68
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
quidditch like three
 

69
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,389
quidditch like three
two four inclusive okay this means

70
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
two four inclusive okay this means
 

71
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,310
two four inclusive okay this means
inclusive uh four to five

72
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
inclusive uh four to five
 

73
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,069
inclusive uh four to five
so i want you to find out the

74
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
so i want you to find out the
 

75
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,830
so i want you to find out the
and all kinds of these clearly i want

76
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
and all kinds of these clearly i want
 

77
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,430
and all kinds of these clearly i want
you to find out that the

78
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
you to find out that the
 

79
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,470
you to find out that the
the sum the sum of the

80
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
the sum the sum of the
 

81
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,589
the sum the sum of the
this is the index 3 4 would be like 0 1

82
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
this is the index 3 4 would be like 0 1
 

83
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,790
this is the index 3 4 would be like 0 1
2 3 3 4 will be 3 will be pointing to

84
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
2 3 3 4 will be 3 will be pointing to
 

85
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,710
2 3 3 4 will be 3 will be pointing to
this 4 will probably need to leave

86
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
this 4 will probably need to leave
 

87
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,990
this 4 will probably need to leave
so 3 3 4 will be 7 plus a equals 15

88
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
so 3 3 4 will be 7 plus a equals 15
 

89
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,630
so 3 3 4 will be 7 plus a equals 15
right

90
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
right
 

91
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,470
right
4 5 is 17 right so you could be like

92
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
4 5 is 17 right so you could be like
 

93
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,630
4 5 is 17 right so you could be like
zero five zero one two three four five

94
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
zero five zero one two three four five
 

95
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,350
zero five zero one two three four five
so it would be

96
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
so it would be
 

97
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,150
so it would be
nine nine ten no 1 2 4 9

98
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
nine nine ten no 1 2 4 9
 

99
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,750
nine nine ten no 1 2 4 9
what 16 24 33

100
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
what 16 24 33
 

101
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,190
what 16 24 33
so you get it yeah i is zero

102
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
so you get it yeah i is zero
 

103
00:02:45,200 --> 00:03:01,830
so you get it yeah i is zero
five zero means to start from the

104
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840

 

105
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,949

0 is here 5 is here so what's the

106
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
0 is here 5 is here so what's the
 

107
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,149
0 is here 5 is here so what's the
how the sum of these will be 1 plus 3

108
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
how the sum of these will be 1 plus 3
 

109
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,430
how the sum of these will be 1 plus 3
plus 5

110
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
plus 5
 

111
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,350
plus 5
so how do you do do that i mean without

112
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
so how do you do do that i mean without
 

113
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,030
so how do you do do that i mean without
the prefix sum you just

114
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
the prefix sum you just
 

115
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,589
the prefix sum you just
you you just can do the indicator number

116
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
you you just can do the indicator number
 

117
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,530
you you just can do the indicator number
remember

so then we can do this for i

122
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
so then we can do this for i
 

123
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,949

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
one tip is that when you see a four it's
 

169
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,150
one tip is that when you see a four it's
usually oh

170
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
usually oh
 

171
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,390
usually oh
and right because you when you see these

172
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
and right because you when you see these
 

173
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,510
and right because you when you see these
four yeah

174
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
four yeah
 

175
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,909
four yeah
it's usually over because you need to

176
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
it's usually over because you need to
 

177
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,710
it's usually over because you need to
iterate

178
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
iterate
 

179
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,830
iterate
those numbers so right

180
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
those numbers so right
 

181
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,550
those numbers so right
time you say four ninety percent

182
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
time you say four ninety percent
 

183
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,749
time you say four ninety percent
ninety-nine percent maybe

184
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
ninety-nine percent maybe
 

185
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,950
ninety-nine percent maybe
i won't need the number four look

186
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
i won't need the number four look
 

187
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,710
i won't need the number four look
when you see this it's it's o n why

188
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
when you see this it's it's o n why
 

189
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,629
when you see this it's it's o n why
because we need to iterate the numbers

190
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
because we need to iterate the numbers
 

191
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,430
because we need to iterate the numbers
from

192
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
from
 

193
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,629
from
at this range right yeah so this range

194
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
at this range right yeah so this range
 

195
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,550
at this range right yeah so this range
are changed so it means that it's o

196
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
are changed so it means that it's o
 

197
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,550
are changed so it means that it's o
n o n

198
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560

 

199
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,430

range yeah and this is variable this is

200
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
range yeah and this is variable this is
 

201
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,189
range yeah and this is variable this is
the input

202
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
the input
 

203
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,629
the input
if i tell you if it is 4 i

204
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
if i tell you if it is 4 i
 

205
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,590
if i tell you if it is 4 i
in range 100

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
in range 100
 

207
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,110
in range 100
i in branch 100 s plus equals i what's

208
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
i in branch 100 s plus equals i what's
 

209
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,469
i in branch 100 s plus equals i what's
the time capacity

210
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
the time capacity
 

211
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,070
the time capacity
a thousand maybe what's the time

212
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
a thousand maybe what's the time
 

213
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,170
a thousand maybe what's the time
confidence complexity of this one

214
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,180
confidence complexity of this one

[Music]

216
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520

 

217
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,830

you guess uh wait

218
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840

 

219
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,189

then that word

220
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
then that word
 

221
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,310
then that word
for so this is always what's this

222
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
for so this is always what's this
 

223
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,430
for so this is always what's this
a one a one exactly why is that because

224
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
a one a one exactly why is that because
 

225
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,749
a one a one exactly why is that because
this

226
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
this
 

227
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,950
this
is constant it never changed

228
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
is constant it never changed
 

229
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,550
is constant it never changed
it means if i have one you can say well

230
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
it means if i have one you can say well
 

231
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,870
it means if i have one you can say well
one thousand but we drop the constant

232
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
one thousand but we drop the constant
 

233
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,870
one thousand but we drop the constant
remember we talked about this in in the

234
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
remember we talked about this in in the
 

235
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,710
remember we talked about this in in the
equivalent complexity yeah

236
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
equivalent complexity yeah
 

237
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,670
equivalent complexity yeah
this is o and because n is actually

238
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
this is o and because n is actually
 

239
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,870
this is o and because n is actually
equals

240
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
equals
 

241
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,590
equals
two minus from right these two are

242
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
two minus from right these two are
 

243
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,150
two minus from right these two are
changing

244
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
changing
 

245
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,790
changing
this is the input so we can drop it why

246
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
this is the input so we can drop it why
 

247
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,909
this is the input so we can drop it why
the only one

248
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
the only one
 

249
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,710
the only one
oh one because this is constant it means

250
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
oh one because this is constant it means
 

251
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,390
oh one because this is constant it means
that no matter how big is the input

252
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
that no matter how big is the input
 

253
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,670
that no matter how big is the input
we're still doing this

254
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
we're still doing this
 

255
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,870
we're still doing this
one thousand so if we go one thousand

256
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
one thousand so if we go one thousand
 

257
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,550
one thousand so if we go one thousand
is a one yeah it's a constant it's a one

258
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
is a one yeah it's a constant it's a one
 

259
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,110
is a one yeah it's a constant it's a one
if it's a minion it's also a one in

260
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
if it's a minion it's also a one in
 

261
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,790
if it's a minion it's also a one in
series you know

262
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
series you know
 

263
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,990
series you know
it's only just one it's over

264
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
it's only just one it's over
 

265
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,830
it's only just one it's over
with n and n is changing so let's open

266
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
with n and n is changing so let's open
 

267
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,189
with n and n is changing so let's open
got it

268
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
got it
 

269
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,790
got it
yes okay so now look this is all n right

270
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
yes okay so now look this is all n right
 

271
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,110
yes okay so now look this is all n right
this is o n right because we every time

272
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
this is o n right because we every time
 

273
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,710
this is o n right because we every time
we need to iterate the numbers

274
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
we need to iterate the numbers
 

275
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,309
we need to iterate the numbers
yes but how about if we are n queries

276
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
yes but how about if we are n queries
 

277
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,510
yes but how about if we are n queries
if we are n what's the total complexity

278
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
if we are n what's the total complexity
 

279
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,189
if we are n what's the total complexity
what does it mean

280
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
what does it mean
 

281
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,870
what does it mean
so if they are like an entire m queries

282
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
so if they are like an entire m queries
 

283
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,390
so if they are like an entire m queries
query and number terms like every time i

284
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
query and number terms like every time i
 

285
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,270
query and number terms like every time i
give you a throne and

286
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
give you a throne and
 

287
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,270
give you a throne and
like two index i give you a letter and

288
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
like two index i give you a letter and
 

289
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,469
like two index i give you a letter and
in terms of it

290
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
in terms of it
 

291
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,909
in terms of it
so the complexities o what

292
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
so the complexities o what
 

293
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,189
so the complexities o what
all together m times

294
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
all together m times
 

295
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,309
all together m times
n right because n is the time

296
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
n right because n is the time
 

297
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,350
n right because n is the time
we are going to iterate we you we are

298
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
we are going to iterate we you we are
 

299
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,670
we are going to iterate we you we are
going to calculate one query right

300
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
going to calculate one query right
 

301
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,550
going to calculate one query right
am right and they are in terms of it so

302
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
am right and they are in terms of it so
 

303
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,110
am right and they are in terms of it so
let's um

304
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
let's um
 

305
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,150
let's um
omm right yes and time

306
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
omm right yes and time
 

307
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,029
omm right yes and time
then yes does that make sense yeah

308
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
then yes does that make sense yeah
 

309
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,430
then yes does that make sense yeah
because there are m queries and each

310
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
because there are m queries and each
 

311
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,189
because there are m queries and each
it really takes n time right right

312
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
it really takes n time right right
 

313
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,550
it really takes n time right right
yes so can we do better because if this

314
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
yes so can we do better because if this
 

315
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,270
yes so can we do better because if this
number is not changing if this number is

316
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
number is not changing if this number is
 

317
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,550
number is not changing if this number is
still changing we can

318
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
still changing we can
 

319
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,350
still changing we can
get it right

320
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360

 

321
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,510

stop it how do we change it

322
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
stop it how do we change it
 

323
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,869
stop it how do we change it
how do we implement it if i give you an

324
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
how do we implement it if i give you an
 

325
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,749
how do we implement it if i give you an
example if i

326
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
example if i
 

327
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,189
example if i
i know i i calculate this if i say

numbers uh
 

387
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,269
numbers uh
i didn't know you were talking about

388
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
i didn't know you were talking about
 

389
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,949
i didn't know you were talking about
that yeah yeah yeah okay

that yeah yeah yeah okay
 

391
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,070
that yeah yeah yeah okay
yeah so i if i calculate this this

392
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
yeah so i if i calculate this this
 

393
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,350
yeah so i if i calculate this this
how if i want to calculate this array

394
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
how if i want to calculate this array
 

395
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,190
how if i want to calculate this array
what's the time capacity

396
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200

 

397
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,630

back thank you season

398
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
back thank you season
 

399
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,430
back thank you season
yeah what was the time complexity if i

400
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
yeah what was the time complexity if i
 

401
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,070
yeah what was the time complexity if i
want to

402
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
want to
 

403
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,230
want to
calculate a prefix sum array of the

404
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
calculate a prefix sum array of the
 

405
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,900
calculate a prefix sum array of the
computer prefix sum of this array

406
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:38,910
computer prefix sum of this array
 

407
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,949

one yes because we need to eat once

414
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839

 

415
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,350

so why is this happening if the prefix i

416
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
so why is this happening if the prefix i
 

417
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,550
so why is this happening if the prefix i
equals the sum of the first i numbers

418
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
equals the sum of the first i numbers
 

419
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,509
equals the sum of the first i numbers
so if i i want you to know if i want to

420
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
so if i i want you to know if i want to
 

421
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:05,910
so if i i want you to know if i want to

437
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,910
to eight is what is 20 right yeah 20.
so this co so if i have this prefix

438
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
so this co so if i have this prefix
 

439
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,150
so this co so if i have this prefix
sound so what does it equal

440
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
sound so what does it equal
 

441
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,430
sound so what does it equal
prefix if i say prefix one two three

442
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
prefix if i say prefix one two three
 

443
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,750
prefix if i say prefix one two three
four

444
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
four
 

445
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,110

five if it's five okay let's do it five

446
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
five if it's five okay let's do it five
 

447
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,630
five if it's five okay let's do it five
okay equals one

448
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
okay equals one
 

449
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,069
okay equals one
one plus four three four

450
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
one plus four three four
 

451
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,230

okay and then prefix of the first two

454
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
okay and then prefix of the first two
 

455
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,550
okay and then prefix of the first two
numbers

there look i want to calculate the sum
of these three numbers

486
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
of these three numbers
 

487
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,389
of these three numbers
i know the first sum of these five

488
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
i know the first sum of these five
 

489
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,470

yeah exactly so look i can just do this
 

497
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,069
yeah exactly so look i can just do this
minus yeah so what's the term complexity

498
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
minus yeah so what's the term complexity
 

499
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,790
minus yeah so what's the term complexity
of this

500
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800

 

501
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,990

what's better than why are we doing this

502
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
what's better than why are we doing this
 

503
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,150
what's better than why are we doing this
um i can just substrate what's the

504
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
um i can just substrate what's the
 

505
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,949
um i can just substrate what's the
complexity

506
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959

 

507
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,710

what's the complexity oh

508
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
what's the complexity oh
 

509
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,590
what's the complexity oh
and again why is there no getting one

510
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
and again why is there no getting one
 

511
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,750
and again why is there no getting one
just guessing

512
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
just guessing
 

513
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,230
just guessing
one or one yeah of course look i i just

514
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
one or one yeah of course look i i just
 

515
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,430
one or one yeah of course look i i just
calculated to the math

516
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
calculated to the math
 

517
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,590
calculated to the math
right because i know this number i know

518
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
right because i know this number i know
 

519
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,190
right because i know this number i know
this number i just do this

520
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200
this number i just do this
 

521
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,670
this number i just do this
so do you see why we are doing this we

522
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
so do you see why we are doing this we
 

523
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,949
so do you see why we are doing this we
here we have we we

524
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
here we have we we
 

525
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,470
here we have we we
we we we use o n

526
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,480
we we we use o n
 

527
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,790
we we we use o n
to calculate this prefix sum right yeah

528
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
to calculate this prefix sum right yeah
 

529
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,829
to calculate this prefix sum right yeah
and then we have o

530
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
and then we have o
 

531
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,430
and then we have o
n to calculate it so it would have m

532
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
n to calculate it so it would have m
 

533
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,230
n to calculate it so it would have m
query

534
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
query
 

535
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,269
query
and the concave next c would be

536
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
and the concave next c would be
 

537
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,550
and the concave next c would be
just o m right right yeah

538
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
just o m right right yeah
 

539
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,430
just o m right right yeah
because the constant time to look up

540
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,440
because the constant time to look up
 

541
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,550
because the constant time to look up
these two values

542
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
these two values
 

543
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,110
these two values
right all right does it make sense so

544
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
right all right does it make sense so
 

545
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,990
right all right does it make sense so
we're improving this algorithm yeah

546
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
we're improving this algorithm yeah
 

547
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,509
we're improving this algorithm yeah
so you see somebody coding no not yet

548
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
so you see somebody coding no not yet
 

549
00:12:49,519 --> 00:13:03,910
so you see somebody coding no not yet
so look uh

550
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920

 

551
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,230

so look we have given the numbers yeah

552
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
so look we have given the numbers yeah
 

553
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,990
so look we have given the numbers yeah
so we don't need to actually write

554
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
so we don't need to actually write
 

555
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,750
so we don't need to actually write
many things okay one two

three four five let's say i know we need

558
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
three four five let's say i know we need
 

559
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,470
three four five let's say i know we need
to have a prefix sound prefix

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480

 

561
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,430

prefix let's let's let's push it at zero

00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
at the beginning okay
 

565
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,350
at the beginning okay
yeah i'll tell you why i need the g n at

566
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
yeah i'll tell you why i need the g n at
 

567
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,600
yeah i'll tell you why i need the g n at

568
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:27,610

yeah s equals zero and for i

572
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
yeah s equals zero and for i
 

573
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,750
yeah s equals zero and for i
in lump yeah look

574
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
in lump yeah look
 

575
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,350
in lump yeah look
look s common sum is s plus equals i

576
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
look s common sum is s plus equals i
 

577
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,829
look s common sum is s plus equals i
right uh equals i right yeah

578
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
right uh equals i right yeah
 

579
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,069
right uh equals i right yeah
so now we are calculating the sum along

580
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
so now we are calculating the sum along
 

581
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,189
so now we are calculating the sum along
the way so okay

582
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:47,199
the way so okay
 

583
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,790
the way so okay
this s will be 1 3 6

584
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
this s will be 1 3 6
 

585
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,230
this s will be 1 3 6
10 15 right and every time we go to s we

586
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
10 15 right and every time we go to s we
 

587
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,550
10 15 right and every time we go to s we
just push it to the

588
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
just push it to the
 

589
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,230
just push it to the
prefix uh just to push it to to the

590
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
prefix uh just to push it to to the
 

591
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,870
prefix uh just to push it to to the

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
so now after this what what's the
 

595
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,990
so now after this what what's the
content of prefix

596
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
content of prefix

00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
can you guess we've got a yellow and
 

599
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,030
can you guess we've got a yellow and
then

600
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
then
 

601
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,310
then
one eye numbers i one

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
one eye numbers i one
 

603
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,590

from index two to into four what's the
 

667
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,790
from index two to into four what's the
answer

668
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
answer
 

669
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,910
answer
24 yeah 24

670
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
24 yeah 24
 

671
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,110
24 yeah 24
6 2 plus 3 plus 4 what

672
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
6 2 plus 3 plus 4 what
 

673
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,310
6 2 plus 3 plus 4 what
i said two and four two two x three two

674
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
i said two and four two two x three two
 

675
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,389
i said two and four two two x three two
nine nine yeah from ah

676
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399

 

677
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,269

this interval is nine right yeah yeah so

678
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:13,279
this interval is nine right yeah yeah so
 

679
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,430
this interval is nine right yeah yeah so
how can we get this here

680
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
how can we get this here
 

681
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,470
how can we get this here
from t t zero one two

682
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
from t t zero one two
 

683
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,269
from t t zero one two
three t t is three yeah so i want to get

684
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
three t t is three yeah so i want to get
 

685
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:21,829
three t t is three yeah so i want to get
the first

686
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
the first
 

687
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,790
the first
value zero one two three four so it's

688
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
value zero one two three four so it's
 

689
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,110
value zero one two three four so it's
ten

690
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
ten
 

691
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,550
ten
when we are done wait wait wait ten

692
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
when we are done wait wait wait ten
 

693
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,990
when we are done wait wait wait ten
and then zero two strong will be

694
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,000
and then zero two strong will be
 

695
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,230
and then zero two strong will be
one right one so here

696
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
one right one so here
 

697
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,269
one right one so here
you see so we got the 10 minus 1 is 9.

698
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
you see so we got the 10 minus 1 is 9.
 

699
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:39,910
you see so we got the 10 minus 1 is 9.
you see

700
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
you see
 

701
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,790
you see
we get it look at it remember prefix

702
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800

 

703
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,910

why why we got the f because we added

704
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
why why we got the f because we added
 

705
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,829
why why we got the f because we added
zero at the beginning so we don't need

706
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
zero at the beginning so we don't need
 

707
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,629
zero at the beginning so we don't need
we can just do it plus one minus f right

708
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
we can just do it plus one minus f right
 

709
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,189
we can just do it plus one minus f right
look

710
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
look
 

711
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,470
look
yeah we don't need to uh if this is the

712
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
yeah we don't need to uh if this is the
 

713
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,430
yeah we don't need to uh if this is the
same

714
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
same
 

715
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,509
same
prefix that's a one

716
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
prefix that's a one
 

717
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,549
prefix that's a one
look if if it's the one to one to

718
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
look if if it's the one to one to
 

719
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,669
look if if it's the one to one to
one if from uh from front and two is

720
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
one if from uh from front and two is
 

721
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,750
one if from uh from front and two is
also one index

722
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
also one index
 

723
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,270
also one index
so t t one plus one is two

724
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
so t t one plus one is two
 

725
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,590
so t t one plus one is two
right right so t is one

726
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
right right so t is one
 

727
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,949
right right so t is one
t uh no no t uh this is

728
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
t uh no no t uh this is
 

729
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,470
t uh no no t uh this is
at zero zero plus one is one here

730
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
at zero zero plus one is one here
 

731
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,669
at zero zero plus one is one here
minus zero so look it's one minus zero

732
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
minus zero so look it's one minus zero
 

733
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,310
minus zero so look it's one minus zero
is one

734
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
is one
 

735
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,430
is one
so you get it yes so why are we using

736
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,440
so you get it yes so why are we using
 

737
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,549
so you get it yes so why are we using
this can you tell me in

738
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
this can you tell me in
 

739
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,310
this can you tell me in
in one sentence why are we using a

740
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
in one sentence why are we using a
 

741
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,669
in one sentence why are we using a
prefix sound

742
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
prefix sound
 

743
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,789
prefix sound
and then we can end this class why

744
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
and then we can end this class why
 

745
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,070
and then we can end this class why
why yes

746
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080

 

747
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:53,029

why are we doing this

748
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039

 

749
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,510

to speed up the calculation right yeah

750
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
to speed up the calculation right yeah
 

751
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,310
to speed up the calculation right yeah
because

752
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
because
 

753
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,789
because
if we don't have this prefix sum we want

754
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
if we don't have this prefix sum we want
 

755
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,390
if we don't have this prefix sum we want
to calculate the range we need to

756
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,400
to calculate the range we need to
 

757
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,510
to calculate the range we need to
iterate these

758
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
iterate these
 

759
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,870
iterate these
numbers yes we need to integrate

760
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
numbers yes we need to integrate
 

761
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,549
numbers yes we need to integrate
for example we need to iterate two plus

762
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
for example we need to iterate two plus
 

763
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,150
for example we need to iterate two plus
three plus one that

764
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
three plus one that
 

765
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,070
three plus one that
that's time consuming if we have a

766
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
that's time consuming if we have a
 

767
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,630
that's time consuming if we have a
million times or maybe a thousand

768
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
million times or maybe a thousand
 

769
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,510
million times or maybe a thousand
million than

770
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
million than
 

771
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,950
million than
to do right yes i know but now

772
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
to do right yes i know but now
 

773
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,070
to do right yes i know but now
if i prefix some you just give me me a

774
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
if i prefix some you just give me me a
 

775
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,630
if i prefix some you just give me me a
two

776
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
two
 

777
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,270
two
two positions yeah because i can just

778
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
two positions yeah because i can just
 

779
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,750
two positions yeah because i can just
look it up in the prefix array

780
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
look it up in the prefix array
 

781
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,669
look it up in the prefix array
and i can just do a simple mess am i

782
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
and i can just do a simple mess am i
 

783
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,830
and i can just do a simple mess am i
right i know be a lot faster

784
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
right i know be a lot faster
 

785
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,029
right i know be a lot faster
right but this is only uh useful if you

786
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
right but this is only uh useful if you
 

787
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,590
right but this is only uh useful if you
you

788
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
you
 

789
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,710
you
if this original array is not changing

790
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
if this original array is not changing
 

791
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,789
if this original array is not changing
right it's not just because the numbers

792
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
right it's not just because the numbers
 

793
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,909
right it's not just because the numbers
are staying the same

794
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
are staying the same
 

795
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,110
are staying the same
all the time okay okay okay so good job

796
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
all the time okay okay okay so good job
 

797
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,590
all the time okay okay okay so good job
today

798
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
today
 

799
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,830
today
say bye-bye

800
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840

 

801
