00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,110
up hello hello we stay when we stop
riding higher today

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,120
riding higher today
 

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,110
riding higher today
okay so do you still remember what's

6
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
okay so do you still remember what's
 

7
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,270
okay so do you still remember what's
ugly longer

8
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
ugly longer
 

9
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,709
ugly longer
yeah not kind

10
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
yeah not kind
 

11
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,029
yeah not kind
yeah so what

12
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
yeah so what
 

13
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,550
yeah so what
so yeah it's about it's a number that if

14
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
so yeah it's about it's a number that if
 

15
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,029
so yeah it's about it's a number that if
it's

16
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
it's
 

17
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,390
it's
prime uh it's um

18
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
prime uh it's um
 

19
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,509
prime uh it's um
if it can be expressed as 2 to the power

20
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
if it can be expressed as 2 to the power
 

21
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,070
if it can be expressed as 2 to the power
of a

22
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
of a
 

23
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,189
of a
times 3 to the power of b times five

24
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
times 3 to the power of b times five
 

25
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,549
times 3 to the power of b times five
times

26
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
times
 

27
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,350
times
power to the power of c if a bigger or

28
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
power to the power of c if a bigger or
 

29
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,950
power to the power of c if a bigger or
equal zero

30
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
equal zero
 

31
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,350
equal zero
b e bigger or equal to zero c bigger

32
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
b e bigger or equal to zero c bigger
 

33
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,830
b e bigger or equal to zero c bigger
equals zero so it's a positive

34
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
equals zero so it's a positive
 

35
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,950
equals zero so it's a positive
positive

36
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
positive
 

37
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,750
positive
yeah if it's prime factors only two

38
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
yeah if it's prime factors only two
 

39
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,150
yeah if it's prime factors only two
three five for example like uh

40
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
three five for example like uh
 

41
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,790
three five for example like uh
obviously these two two three five is

42
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
obviously these two two three five is
 

43
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,389
obviously these two two three five is
the prime factor yeah

44
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
the prime factor yeah
 

45
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,229
the prime factor yeah
it's a ugly number the first other

46
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
it's a ugly number the first other
 

47
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,189
it's a ugly number the first other
number one it's a special case

48
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
number one it's a special case
 

49
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,590
number one it's a special case
does it have to be three no it doesn't

50
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
does it have to be three no it doesn't
 

51
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,110
does it have to be three no it doesn't
look this is the prime

52
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
look this is the prime
 

53
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,710
look this is the prime
this is the other number this is also

54
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
this is the other number this is also
 

55
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,310
this is the other number this is also
open number because this two to the

56
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
open number because this two to the
 

57
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,270
open number because this two to the
power of one

58
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
power of one
 

59
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,190
power of one
this is two to the power of zero this is

60
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
this is two to the power of zero this is
 

61
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,789
this is two to the power of zero this is
three to the power of

62
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
three to the power of
 

63
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,630
three to the power of
one 4 is also rb number because 2 to the

64
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
one 4 is also rb number because 2 to the
 

65
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,270
one 4 is also rb number because 2 to the
power of 2

66
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
power of 2
 

67
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,710
power of 2
is 1 prime factors only 2 3 5

68
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
is 1 prime factors only 2 3 5
 

69
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,429
is 1 prime factors only 2 3 5
5 6 is is it 2 to the power of 6 yes 2

70
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
5 6 is is it 2 to the power of 6 yes 2
 

71
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,350
5 6 is is it 2 to the power of 6 yes 2
to the power 1 times 3 to the power one

72
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
to the power 1 times 3 to the power one
 

73
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,070
to the power 1 times 3 to the power one
right

74
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
right
 

75
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,469
right
seven is seventy no because seven it

76
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
seven is seventy no because seven it
 

77
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,789
seven is seventy no because seven it
cannot be x squared since the factors

78
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
cannot be x squared since the factors
 

79
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,870
cannot be x squared since the factors
two three five right so this is not ugly

80
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
two three five right so this is not ugly
 

81
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,469
two three five right so this is not ugly
number right

82
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
number right
 

83
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,510
number right
eight is it two or no

84
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
eight is it two or no
 

85
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,789
eight is it two or no
it can be two express that two to the

86
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
it can be two express that two to the
 

87
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,069
it can be two express that two to the
power of three so it's a

88
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
power of three so it's a
 

89
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,310
power of three so it's a
arcane number right and nine how about

90
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
arcane number right and nine how about
 

91
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,710
arcane number right and nine how about
nine is it

92
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
nine is it
 

93
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,310
nine is it
remember three

94
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
remember three
 

95
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,069
remember three
to the power of two so it's argument so

96
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
to the power of two so it's argument so
 

97
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,469
to the power of two so it's argument so
if it's a number it's prime factor only

98
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
if it's a number it's prime factor only
 

99
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,030
if it's a number it's prime factor only
two

100
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
two
 

101
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,789
two
three or five right it doesn't have to

102
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
three or five right it doesn't have to
 

103
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,270
three or five right it doesn't have to
be two three five all together it's

104
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
be two three five all together it's
 

105
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,429
be two three five all together it's
just two three or five then it's

106
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
just two three or five then it's
 

107
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,550
just two three or five then it's
actually number right

108
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
actually number right
 

109
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,109
actually number right
this is not right ten is it a aggie

110
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
this is not right ten is it a aggie
 

111
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,830
this is not right ten is it a aggie
number

112
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
number
 

113
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,990
number
uh

114
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000

 

115
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,550

it's what two times five it's the

116
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
it's what two times five it's the
 

117
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,110
it's what two times five it's the
argument

118
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
argument
 

119
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,470
argument
because two to the power of one times

120
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
because two to the power of one times
 

121
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,309
because two to the power of one times
right number how about eleven is it an

122
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
right number how about eleven is it an
 

123
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,670
right number how about eleven is it an
early number

124
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
early number
 

125
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,550
early number
um yes i didn't fix that no because

126
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
um yes i didn't fix that no because
 

127
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,630
um yes i didn't fix that no because
eleven is the point number one which is

128
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
eleven is the point number one which is
 

129
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,030
eleven is the point number one which is
not

130
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
not
 

131
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,830
not
equivalent these are our prime number

132
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
equivalent these are our prime number
 

133
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,670
equivalent these are our prime number
prime vectors that's what i'm saying if

134
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
prime vectors that's what i'm saying if
 

135
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,309
prime vectors that's what i'm saying if
it's a

136
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
it's a
 

137
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,670
it's a
point number that is bigger than

138
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
point number that is bigger than
 

139
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,430
point number that is bigger than
if it's a prime number like it's bigger

140
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
if it's a prime number like it's bigger
 

141
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,470
if it's a prime number like it's bigger
than five it's not a

142
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
than five it's not a
 

143
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,110
than five it's not a
argument right now

144
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120

 

145
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,670

does it make sense if because we are we

146
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
does it make sense if because we are we
 

147
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,350
does it make sense if because we are we
are asking the

148
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
are asking the
 

149
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,470
are asking the
the plan the prime factors if it's only

150
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
the plan the prime factors if it's only
 

151
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,229
the plan the prime factors if it's only
containing the 235 yeah

152
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
containing the 235 yeah
 

153
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,990
containing the 235 yeah
do you still remember how we're testing

154
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
do you still remember how we're testing
 

155
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,150
do you still remember how we're testing
it how we check if the

156
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
it how we check if the
 

157
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,470
it how we check if the
number is number yeah we talked about

158
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
number is number yeah we talked about
 

159
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,830
number is number yeah we talked about
this before

160
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
this before
 

161
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,830
this before
it's ugly yeah and right

162
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
it's ugly yeah and right
 

163
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,190
it's ugly yeah and right
and smaller than 1 is 4

164
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
and smaller than 1 is 4
 

165
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,229
and smaller than 1 is 4
right all right and then now look eric

166
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
right all right and then now look eric
 

167
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,149
right all right and then now look eric
y n can be divided by

168
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
y n can be divided by
 

169
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,070
y n can be divided by
2 we repeatedly divided by 2 right

170
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
2 we repeatedly divided by 2 right
 

171
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,229
2 we repeatedly divided by 2 right
yeah and

172
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
yeah and
 

173
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,589
yeah and
y and and the right can be divided by 3

174
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
y and and the right can be divided by 3
 

175
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,110
y and and the right can be divided by 3
we continue dividing by 3 right

176
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
we continue dividing by 3 right
 

177
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,030
we continue dividing by 3 right
wire n can divided by five

178
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
wire n can divided by five
 

179
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,949
wire n can divided by five
we continue to divide it by five and

180
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
we continue to divide it by five and
 

181
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,190
we continue to divide it by five and
then we just need to check return

182
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
then we just need to check return
 

183
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,350
then we just need to check return
n equals one j equals one

184
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
n equals one j equals one
 

185
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,030
n equals one j equals one
and equals if we can divide it if it's a

186
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
and equals if we can divide it if it's a
 

187
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,190
and equals if we can divide it if it's a
number yeah yeah because yeah because we

188
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
number yeah yeah because yeah because we
 

189
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,670
number yeah yeah because yeah because we
are these three

190
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
are these three
 

191
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,110
are these three
means that we are repeatedly removing

192
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
means that we are repeatedly removing
 

193
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,589
means that we are repeatedly removing
the

194
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
the
 

195
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,390
the
just you know if it can be if the prime

196
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
just you know if it can be if the prime
 

197
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,470
just you know if it can be if the prime
factors can contains two we just

198
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
factors can contains two we just
 

199
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,030
factors can contains two we just
you know keep dividing it and three and

200
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
you know keep dividing it and three and
 

201
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,149
you know keep dividing it and three and
five as well so

202
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
five as well so
 

203
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,470
five as well so
look we can we can write this into a

204
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
look we can we can write this into a
 

205
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,350
look we can we can write this into a
nice

206
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
nice
 

207
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,509
nice
for loop yeah for i in

208
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
for loop yeah for i in
 

209
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,949
for loop yeah for i in
two three five right column

210
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
two three five right column
 

211
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,949
two three five right column
wire n can divided by

212
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
wire n can divided by
 

213
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,189
wire n can divided by
i and then n keep dividing by i

214
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
i and then n keep dividing by i
 

215
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,670
i and then n keep dividing by i
right yeah so this is shorter yeah you

216
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
right yeah so this is shorter yeah you
 

217
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,030
right yeah so this is shorter yeah you
please for i

218
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
please for i
 

219
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,950
please for i
remember that three four and then i put

220
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
remember that three four and then i put
 

221
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,950
remember that three four and then i put
this using the four loop

222
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
this using the four loop
 

223
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,550
this using the four loop
and then i keep dividing it what's the

224
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
and then i keep dividing it what's the
 

225
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,990
and then i keep dividing it what's the
time complexity of this one um

226
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000

 

227
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,950

oh logar and let's say okay

228
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960

 

229
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,070

actually yeah because it could be

230
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
actually yeah because it could be
 

231
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,590
actually yeah because it could be
two three five so roughly overlook scale

232
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
two three five so roughly overlook scale
 

233
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,909
two three five so roughly overlook scale
so how about if i give you this function

234
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
so how about if i give you this function
 

235
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,510
so how about if i give you this function
and i want you to

236
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
and i want you to
 

237
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,030
and i want you to
to generate the nth nth

238
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
to generate the nth nth
 

239
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,350
to generate the nth nth
rdv number okay so this is today's topic

240
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
rdv number okay so this is today's topic
 

241
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,029
rdv number okay so this is today's topic
so if n equals 1 you should give me

242
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
so if n equals 1 you should give me
 

243
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,350
so if n equals 1 you should give me
one the first active number is one yeah

244
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
one the first active number is one yeah
 

245
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,590
one the first active number is one yeah
n equals two you should give me

246
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
n equals two you should give me
 

247
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,350
n equals two you should give me
two n equals three used to give me three

248
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
two n equals three used to give me three
 

249
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,390
two n equals three used to give me three
i equals four usually give me one

250
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
i equals four usually give me one
 

251
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,350
i equals four usually give me one
four n equals five usually give me five

252
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
four n equals five usually give me five
 

253
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:21,590
four n equals five usually give me five
n

254
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
n
 

255
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,550
n
equals six equals six and then you got

256
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
equals six equals six and then you got
 

257
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,070
equals six equals six and then you got
seven you give me one

258
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
seven you give me one
 

259
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,510
seven you give me one
seven no that's a trap come on seven is

260
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
seven no that's a trap come on seven is
 

261
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,909
seven no that's a trap come on seven is
no

262
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
no
 

263
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,029
no
ugly number right these are numbers so

264
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
ugly number right these are numbers so
 

265
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,430
ugly number right these are numbers so
what's the next number

266
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
what's the next number
 

267
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,029
what's the next number
eight yeah yeah and does it make sense

268
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
eight yeah yeah and does it make sense
 

269
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:39,430
eight yeah yeah and does it make sense
yeah

270
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
yeah
 

271
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,749
yeah
so you give me i want to generate that

272
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
so you give me i want to generate that
 

273
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,710
so you give me i want to generate that
as a

274
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
as a
 

275
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,670
as a
number yeah so how can we do this

276
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680

 

277
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,029

ugly number other general keep

278
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
ugly number other general keep
 

279
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:53,670
ugly number other general keep
generating

280
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
generating
 

281
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,189
generating
yeah so so this is the

282
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
yeah so so this is the
 

283
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,590
yeah so so this is the
proposing right so we're checking each

284
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
proposing right so we're checking each
 

285
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,309
proposing right so we're checking each
number

286
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
number
 

287
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,430
number
yeah and then we check each integer if

288
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
yeah and then we check each integer if
 

289
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,110
yeah and then we check each integer if
it's an argument and then we reduce it

290
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
it's an argument and then we reduce it
 

291
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,670
it's an argument and then we reduce it
but there's a problem that because

292
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
but there's a problem that because
 

293
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,110
but there's a problem that because
because most numbers

294
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
because most numbers
 

295
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,070
because most numbers
are not ugly numbers right yeah because

296
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
are not ugly numbers right yeah because
 

297
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,590
are not ugly numbers right yeah because
there are many many numbers are not

298
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
there are many many numbers are not
 

299
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,830
there are many many numbers are not
every number so it takes time to

300
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
every number so it takes time to
 

301
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,629
every number so it takes time to
to check even those not ugly numbers

302
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
to check even those not ugly numbers
 

303
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,270
to check even those not ugly numbers
right

304
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
right
 

305
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,309
right
right so can we still can we still

306
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
right so can we still can we still
 

307
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,749
right so can we still can we still
write this as a uh as a proof of

308
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
write this as a uh as a proof of
 

309
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,870
write this as a uh as a proof of
like look define ends

310
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
like look define ends
 

311
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,309
like look define ends
ugly yeah ugly number and okay

312
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
ugly yeah ugly number and okay
 

313
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,230
ugly yeah ugly number and okay
so suppose we already know that it's

314
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
so suppose we already know that it's
 

315
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,150
so suppose we already know that it's
ugly function right

316
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
ugly function right
 

317
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,150
ugly function right
so let's say the first number is i

318
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
so let's say the first number is i
 

319
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,749
so let's say the first number is i
equals

320
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
equals
 

321
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,070
equals
let's say uh let's say

322
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
let's say uh let's say
 

323
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,629
let's say uh let's say
the first we we start from one right

324
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
the first we we start from one right
 

325
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,350
the first we we start from one right
then

326
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
then
 

327
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,390
then
look wire why something

328
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
look wire why something
 

329
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,150
look wire why something
let's just write wire two it means that

330
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
let's just write wire two it means that
 

331
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,710
let's just write wire two it means that
why are two what does wire two mean and

332
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
why are two what does wire two mean and
 

333
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,510
why are two what does wire two mean and
it is loop

334
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
it is loop
 

335
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,230
it is loop
always always right but we are breaking

336
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
always always right but we are breaking
 

337
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,110
always always right but we are breaking
look now

338
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
look now
 

339
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,029
look now
look if is ugly

340
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
look if is ugly
 

341
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,070
look if is ugly
okay we will notice it is ugly

342
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
okay we will notice it is ugly
 

343
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,670
okay we will notice it is ugly
i right if this number is if i

344
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
i right if this number is if i
 

345
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,710
i right if this number is if i
is a rb number then i need to

346
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
is a rb number then i need to
 

347
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,909
is a rb number then i need to
end n minus equals one i reduce n

348
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
end n minus equals one i reduce n
 

349
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,670
end n minus equals one i reduce n
right and one n is equals to zero what

350
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
right and one n is equals to zero what
 

351
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:21,990
right and one n is equals to zero what
hap

352
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,000
hap
 

353
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,589
hap
what does it mean it means that this i

354
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
what does it mean it means that this i
 

355
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,710
what does it mean it means that this i
is the n's argument right yeah

356
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
is the n's argument right yeah
 

357
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,749
is the n's argument right yeah
and then i can just return reason why

358
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
and then i can just return reason why
 

359
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,550
and then i can just return reason why
i just said return what yeah okay so

360
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
i just said return what yeah okay so
 

361
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,029
i just said return what yeah okay so
look

362
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
look
 

363
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,749
look
if it's ugly number if i is argument

364
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
if it's ugly number if i is argument
 

365
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,629
if it's ugly number if i is argument
number

366
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
number
 

367
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,070
number
i reduce n by one and then if n is equal

368
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
i reduce n by one and then if n is equal
 

369
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,749
i reduce n by one and then if n is equal
to zero and number i is the

370
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
to zero and number i is the
 

371
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,230
to zero and number i is the
argument number okay then every

372
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
argument number okay then every
 

373
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,150
argument number okay then every
iteration if it's ugly and now what

374
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
iteration if it's ugly and now what
 

375
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,589
iteration if it's ugly and now what
should i do here

376
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
should i do here
 

377
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,830
should i do here
then i should do this if it's not ugly

378
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
then i should do this if it's not ugly
 

379
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,869
then i should do this if it's not ugly
number i should do this

380
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
number i should do this
 

381
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,070
number i should do this
i plus equals one i check next integer

382
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
i plus equals one i check next integer
 

383
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,710
i plus equals one i check next integer
right

384
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
right
 

385
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,510
right
all right so look if it's seven if it's

386
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
all right so look if it's seven if it's
 

387
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,950
all right so look if it's seven if it's
adding number seven

388
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
adding number seven
 

389
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,670
adding number seven
no then you you will not count this part

390
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
no then you you will not count this part
 

391
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,550
no then you you will not count this part
right you will

392
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
right you will
 

393
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,869
right you will
keep adding eight is ugly number i

394
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
keep adding eight is ugly number i
 

395
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,430
keep adding eight is ugly number i
reduce one and check it with n0 right

396
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
reduce one and check it with n0 right
 

397
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,469
reduce one and check it with n0 right
does it make sense so look if

398
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
does it make sense so look if
 

399
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,950
does it make sense so look if
n is 100 you you need to at least

400
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
n is 100 you you need to at least
 

401
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,589
n is 100 you you need to at least
increment

402
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
increment
 

403
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,350
increment
a hundred times right but there are some

404
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
a hundred times right but there are some
 

405
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,469
a hundred times right but there are some
numbers which are not ugly numbers so

406
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
numbers which are not ugly numbers so
 

407
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,790
numbers which are not ugly numbers so
so you will keep checking every number

408
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
so you will keep checking every number
 

409
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,230
so you will keep checking every number
you want to keep checking

410
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
you want to keep checking
 

411
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,430
you want to keep checking
every number between one

412
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
every number between one
 

413
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,269
every number between one
to you know n at least n

414
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
to you know n at least n
 

415
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,589
to you know n at least n
to see if all the numbers inside is a

416
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
to see if all the numbers inside is a
 

417
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,630
to see if all the numbers inside is a
algorithm right

418
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
algorithm right
 

419
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,350
algorithm right
the best cases is all the numbers are

420
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
the best cases is all the numbers are
 

421
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,990
the best cases is all the numbers are
again

422
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
again
 

423
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,190
again
right right all right doesn't make sense

424
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
right right all right doesn't make sense
 

425
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,389
right right all right doesn't make sense
but there are some cases that like 7

426
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
but there are some cases that like 7
 

427
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,710
but there are some cases that like 7
is not ugly number so you will not if

428
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
is not ugly number so you will not if
 

429
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,230
is not ugly number so you will not if
you need still need to check if

430
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
you need still need to check if
 

431
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,269
you need still need to check if
it's actually seven it's it's not then

432
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
it's actually seven it's it's not then
 

433
00:08:59,279 --> 00:08:59,590
it's actually seven it's it's not then
you

434
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
you
 

435
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,430
you
keep if this is true then

436
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
keep if this is true then
 

437
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,550
keep if this is true then
execute this but it's not seven

438
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
execute this but it's not seven
 

439
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,230
execute this but it's not seven
it will return fourth so you will not go

440
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
it will return fourth so you will not go
 

441
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,070
it will return fourth so you will not go
in there you will go here

442
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
in there you will go here
 

443
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,389
in there you will go here
right i will equals one and the next

444
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
right i will equals one and the next
 

445
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,750
right i will equals one and the next
number will be a

446
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
number will be a
 

447
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,389
number will be a
right until it breaks the loop return

448
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
right until it breaks the loop return
 

449
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:16,949
right until it breaks the loop return
right

450
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
right
 

451
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,310
right
here's the because look look

452
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
here's the because look look
 

453
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,070
here's the because look look
why why something why true

454
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
why why something why true
 

455
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,350
why why something why true
and then you say twin

456
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360

 

457
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,790

hello right so computer

458
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
hello right so computer
 

459
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,190
hello right so computer
y2 do something right the computer will

460
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
y2 do something right the computer will
 

461
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,430
y2 do something right the computer will
keep printing hello hello

462
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
keep printing hello hello
 

463
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,710
keep printing hello hello
infinity right you're not exit right

464
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
infinity right you're not exit right
 

465
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,389
infinity right you're not exit right
yeah because this is always condition

466
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
yeah because this is always condition
 

467
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,550
yeah because this is always condition
always true why to do something you keep

468
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
always true why to do something you keep
 

469
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,990
always true why to do something you keep
doing doing doing

470
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
doing doing doing
 

471
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,630
doing doing doing
in your mind endlessly no more than a

472
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
in your mind endlessly no more than a
 

473
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,550
in your mind endlessly no more than a
million times trinia mean

474
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
million times trinia mean
 

475
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,910
million times trinia mean
it won't stop because

476
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920

 

477
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,829

no it's it's not a finite number it's

478
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
no it's it's not a finite number it's
 

479
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,310
no it's it's not a finite number it's
infinity entries because that's why it

480
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
infinity entries because that's why it
 

481
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,110
infinity entries because that's why it
happened 2

482
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
happened 2
 

483
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,230
happened 2
is always true right so here y 2

484
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
is always true right so here y 2
 

485
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,190
is always true right so here y 2
and when one is when this loop will

486
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
and when one is when this loop will
 

487
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,990
and when one is when this loop will
become

488
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
become
 

489
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,030
become
or be exit is only the case when

490
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
or be exit is only the case when
 

491
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,310
or be exit is only the case when
n is going to say zero right

492
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
n is going to say zero right
 

493
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,430
n is going to say zero right
it doesn't make sense yeah okay so now

494
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
it doesn't make sense yeah okay so now
 

495
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,350
it doesn't make sense yeah okay so now
as you can see this is not very

496
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
as you can see this is not very
 

497
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,110
as you can see this is not very
efficient right because we are skipping

498
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
efficient right because we are skipping
 

499
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,990
efficient right because we are skipping
we still need to check most not

500
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
we still need to check most not
 

501
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,269
we still need to check most not
aggregate number right

502
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
aggregate number right
 

503
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,630
aggregate number right
so we can we can generate the

504
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
so we can we can generate the
 

505
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,710
so we can we can generate the
argument using the other approach which

506
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
argument using the other approach which
 

507
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,910
argument using the other approach which
is to

508
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
is to
 

509
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,990
is to
become which is what because

510
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
become which is what because
 

511
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,710
become which is what because
look the aqua numbers only only contains

512
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
look the aqua numbers only only contains
 

513
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,910
look the aqua numbers only only contains
two

514
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
two
 

515
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,190
two
three five these three prime factors yes

516
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
three five these three prime factors yes
 

517
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,350
three five these three prime factors yes
all right yeah so how about if we have a

518
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
all right yeah so how about if we have a
 

519
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,630
all right yeah so how about if we have a
a pool a pool of numbers two three five

520
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
a pool a pool of numbers two three five
 

521
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,430
a pool a pool of numbers two three five
and every time there are two numbers and

522
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
and every time there are two numbers and
 

523
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,550
and every time there are two numbers and
every time

524
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
every time
 

525
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,829
every time
we we take the smallest right we take

526
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
we we take the smallest right we take
 

527
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,230
we we take the smallest right we take
the smallest

528
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
the smallest
 

529
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,269
the smallest
look if the first okay i show you

530
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
look if the first okay i show you
 

531
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,269
look if the first okay i show you
the first one is acting numbers in one

532
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
the first one is acting numbers in one
 

533
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,750
the first one is acting numbers in one
okay and then i have a number to see i

534
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
okay and then i have a number to see i
 

535
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,389
okay and then i have a number to see i
the acting number i have seen this is a

536
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
the acting number i have seen this is a
 

537
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,829
the acting number i have seen this is a
notebook right

538
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
notebook right
 

539
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,590
notebook right
no book yeah yeah so look

540
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
no book yeah yeah so look
 

541
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,030
no book yeah yeah so look
the first article number is look now

542
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
the first article number is look now
 

543
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,550
the first article number is look now
i take i need to repeat the entrance for

544
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
i take i need to repeat the entrance for
 

545
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,509
i take i need to repeat the entrance for
the ends num

546
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
the ends num
 

547
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,790
the ends num
n's algorithm right i take the one

548
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
n's algorithm right i take the one
 

549
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,829
n's algorithm right i take the one
take the smallest from this floor yeah

550
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
take the smallest from this floor yeah
 

551
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:33,030
take the smallest from this floor yeah
one yeah

552
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040

 

553
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,069

this is the number i've seen

554
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
this is the number i've seen
 

555
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,190
this is the number i've seen
i i i use this number two times two

556
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
i i i use this number two times two
 

557
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,630
i i i use this number two times two
times three times five right if they are

558
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
times three times five right if they are
 

559
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,150
times three times five right if they are
not seen here right

560
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
not seen here right
 

561
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,150
not seen here right
so that would be two three five right

562
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
so that would be two three five right
 

563
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,829
so that would be two three five right
and then i've seen i've seen two three

564
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
and then i've seen i've seen two three
 

565
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,509
and then i've seen i've seen two three
five yeah right

566
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
five yeah right
 

567
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,790
five yeah right
okay so next next time i

568
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
okay so next next time i
 

569
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,790
okay so next next time i
i need to take the smallest from this

570
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
i need to take the smallest from this
 

571
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,310
i need to take the smallest from this
this one which is what

572
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
this one which is what
 

573
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,350
this one which is what
okay two okay and then like times

574
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
okay two okay and then like times
 

575
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,629
okay two okay and then like times
times two will be four times three

576
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
times two will be four times three
 

577
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,910
times two will be four times three
will be six right times five will be ten

578
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
will be six right times five will be ten
 

579
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,629
will be six right times five will be ten
right

580
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
right
 

581
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,230
right
these are our big number right because

582
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
these are our big number right because
 

583
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,150
these are our big number right because
every time i would turn take an argument

584
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
every time i would turn take an argument
 

585
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,949
every time i would turn take an argument
number and

586
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
number and
 

587
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,030
number and
multiply it by two three five it's still

588
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
multiply it by two three five it's still
 

589
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,629
multiply it by two three five it's still
an argument right

590
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:16,639
an argument right
 

591
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,310
an argument right
yeah and i put it here look like yeah

592
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
yeah and i put it here look like yeah
 

593
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,629
yeah and i put it here look like yeah
okay now the second arg number is two

594
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
okay now the second arg number is two
 

595
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,350
okay now the second arg number is two
right

596
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
right
 

597
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,750
right
and now

598
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760

 

599
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,389

that's four six four six ten i i need to

600
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
that's four six four six ten i i need to
 

601
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,230
that's four six four six ten i i need to
i need to put it here as well four six

602
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
i need to put it here as well four six
 

603
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,949
i need to put it here as well four six
ten this is remembering this is pretty

604
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
ten this is remembering this is pretty
 

605
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,910
ten this is remembering this is pretty
put it back right

606
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
put it back right
 

607
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,550
put it back right
25 okay so what's the next what's the

608
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
25 okay so what's the next what's the
 

609
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,350
25 okay so what's the next what's the
smallest

610
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
smallest
 

611
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,069
smallest
number so yeah take it out and times two

612
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
number so yeah take it out and times two
 

613
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,389
number so yeah take it out and times two
six yeah yeah but six is here right

614
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
six yeah yeah but six is here right
 

615
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,550
six yeah yeah but six is here right
so i don't need to do anything i've seen

616
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
so i don't need to do anything i've seen
 

617
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,550
so i don't need to do anything i've seen
this before

618
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
this before
 

619
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,350
this before
times three nine right nine is not here

620
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
times three nine right nine is not here
 

621
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,269
times three nine right nine is not here
right i put it here right

622
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
right i put it here right
 

623
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,389
right i put it here right
one times three times five fifteen

624
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
one times three times five fifteen
 

625
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,150
one times three times five fifteen
right and fifteen okay okay so next one

626
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
right and fifteen okay okay so next one
 

627
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,910
right and fifteen okay okay so next one
is four all right

628
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
is four all right
 

629
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,110
is four all right
four four times two

630
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,120
four four times two
 

631
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,389
four four times two
it's not appearing eight

632
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399

 

633
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,430

four times three twelve

634
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
four times three twelve
 

635
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,430
four times three twelve
right these are the number i've seen

636
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
right these are the number i've seen
 

637
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,269
right these are the number i've seen
right 4 times 5

638
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
right 4 times 5
 

639
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,949
right 4 times 5
20. right so you get it now i get the

640
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
20. right so you get it now i get the
 

641
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:25,990
20. right so you get it now i get the
next one is 5.

642
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
next one is 5.
 

643
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,829
next one is 5.
right all right so keep doing this

644
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
right all right so keep doing this
 

645
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,069
right all right so keep doing this
these remember the numbers we have seen

646
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
these remember the numbers we have seen
 

647
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,069
these remember the numbers we have seen
the argument numbers we've seen these

648
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
the argument numbers we've seen these
 

649
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,509
the argument numbers we've seen these
are the current number

650
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
are the current number
 

651
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,949
are the current number
we haven't multiplied by 235

652
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
we haven't multiplied by 235
 

653
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,949
we haven't multiplied by 235
so we're doing this n times every time

654
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
so we're doing this n times every time
 

655
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,790
so we're doing this n times every time
we take it out with the smallest

656
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
we take it out with the smallest
 

657
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,430
we take it out with the smallest
what does it mean we repeat this n times

658
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
what does it mean we repeat this n times
 

659
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,350
what does it mean we repeat this n times
then that would be the ends

660
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
then that would be the ends
 

661
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,389
then that would be the ends
acting number right okay i'm going to

notebook thing using we can use the
 

669
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,269
notebook thing using we can use the
notebook as the set

670
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
notebook as the set
 

671
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,030
notebook as the set
right defined and

672
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
right defined and
 

673
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,350
right defined and
ugly and okay now i have a

okay okay so let's say
 

679
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,710
okay okay so let's say
first number because we have seen one

680
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
first number because we have seen one
 

681
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,310
first number because we have seen one
okay and then the current argument

682
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
okay and then the current argument
 

683
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,710
okay and then the current argument
number

684
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
number
 

685
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,430
number
will be uh let's say theta

686
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
will be uh let's say theta
 

687
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,710
will be uh let's say theta
theta equals one okay

688
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
theta equals one okay
 

689
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,150
theta equals one okay
look for

690
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160

 

691
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,910

i look do you still remember what

692
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
i look do you still remember what
 

693
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,389
i look do you still remember what
uh if we want to get the smallest number

694
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
uh if we want to get the smallest number
 

695
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,750
uh if we want to get the smallest number
from a pool

696
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
from a pool
 

697
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,910
from a pool
what can we do what kind of data

698
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
what can we do what kind of data
 

699
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:51,269
what can we do what kind of data
structure can we use

700
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279

 

701
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,750

the minimum the priority queue and heap

702
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
the minimum the priority queue and heap
 

703
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,550
the minimum the priority queue and heap
remember the hip the smallest here hip

remember the hip the smallest here hip
okay so for uh so this is a hip

706
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
okay so for uh so this is a hip
 

707
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,829
okay so for uh so this is a hip
well we can say this is a hip okay let's

708
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
well we can say this is a hip okay let's
 

709
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,750
well we can say this is a hip okay let's
let's write it as a hip

710
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
let's write it as a hip
 

711
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,470
let's write it as a hip
hip and then look we we need to import

712
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480
hip and then look we we need to import
 

713
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,590
hip and then look we we need to import
the hippie file

714
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
the hippie file
 

715
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,509
the hippie file
my front hip p

716
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
my front hip p
 

717
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,870
my front hip p
import

718

719
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,350

uh hippie important epi file

720
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
uh hippie important epi file
 

721
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,430

hit push yeah and hit pop
 

723
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,509
hit push yeah and hit pop
okay so this is the two functions we

724
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
okay so this is the two functions we
 

725
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,030
okay so this is the two functions we
need to use

726
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
need to use
 

727
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,470
need to use
to to manipulate the list as a hip right

728
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
to to manipulate the list as a hip right
 

729
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,310
to to manipulate the list as a hip right
hippie by

730
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
hippie by
 

731
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,350
hippie by
hit p5 is to we can also import

732
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
hit p5 is to we can also import
 

733
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,829
hit p5 is to we can also import
heavy fight hp5 function so i will have

734
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:39,839
heavy fight hp5 function so i will have
 

735
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,550
heavy fight hp5 function so i will have
a hip

736
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:40,560
a hip
 

737
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,389
a hip
and i will have at least pp5 ep5

738
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
and i will have at least pp5 ep5
 

739
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,829
and i will have at least pp5 ep5
is to turning at least into a hip right

740
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:47,839
is to turning at least into a hip right
 

741
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,030
is to turning at least into a hip right
hand thing releasing into here

742
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
hand thing releasing into here
 

743
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,150
hand thing releasing into here
right and now

744
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
right and now
 

745
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,189
right and now
i need to repair already

746
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
i need to repair already
 

747
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,749
i need to repair already
so look we are for

748
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759

 

749
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,269

end time in range

750
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
end time in range
 

751
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,509
end time in range
because we are going to do this n times

752
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
because we are going to do this n times
 

753
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,829
because we are going to do this n times
two is n times i and then look

754
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
two is n times i and then look
 

755
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,870
two is n times i and then look
we take a current number current ugly

756
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
we take a current number current ugly
 

757
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,550
we take a current number current ugly
number the smallest current argument

758
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
number the smallest current argument
 

759
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,509
number the smallest current argument
number from

760
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
number from
 

761
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,350
number from
the pool right so we use the hip

762
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
the pool right so we use the hip
 

763
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,509
the pool right so we use the hip
hip pop from the hip right

764
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
hip pop from the hip right
 

765
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,790
hip pop from the hip right
so now we take this number

766
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
so now we take this number
 

767
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,310
so now we take this number
and we put it into the scene value we

768
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,320
and we put it into the scene value we
 

769
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:45,910
and we put it into the scene value we
have seen the

770
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920

 

771
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,030

i need to multiply this current in the

772
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
i need to multiply this current in the
 

773
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,310
i need to multiply this current in the
in the value but

774
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
in the value but
 

775
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,350
in the value but
new equals current

776
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
new equals current
 

777
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,870
new equals current
times i so this is the new

778
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
times i so this is the new
 

779
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,870
times i so this is the new
argument number but if it's not been

780
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
argument number but if it's not been
 

781
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,829
argument number but if it's not been
seen before look

782
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
seen before look
 

783
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,669
seen before look
if neo

784
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
if neo
 

785
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,710
if neo
not in sin right if

786
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
not in sin right if
 

787
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,309
not in sin right if
not in sin then i need to push it to the

788
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319

 

789
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,630

scene then i need to add it right this

790
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:16,640
scene then i need to add it right this
 

791
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,789
scene then i need to add it right this
number i need to remember

792
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
number i need to remember
 

793
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,510
number i need to remember
no actually i don't need to i just need

probably i can move this here scene dot

806
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
probably i can move this here scene dot
 

807
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,510
probably i can move this here scene dot
add new so i don't need to do it in two

808
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
add new so i don't need to do it in two
 

809
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,310
add new so i don't need to do it in two
places

810
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
places
 

811
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,549
places
here and and then i need to return

812
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
here and and then i need to return
 

813
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,590
here and and then i need to return
return current right okay

814
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
return current right okay
 

815
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:03,750
return current right okay
does it make sense amazing

seen it and we the the poor remember
 

829
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,190
seen it and we the the poor remember
one one yeah this is the number of

830
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
one one yeah this is the number of
 

831
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,190
one one yeah this is the number of
arcane number we have seen yeah

832
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,200
arcane number we have seen yeah
 

833
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,230
arcane number we have seen yeah
we have seen yeah this is the current

834
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
we have seen yeah this is the current
 

835
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,669
we have seen yeah this is the current
uh hip that the the

836
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
uh hip that the the
 

837
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,549
uh hip that the the
this hip is allow us to get the current

838
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
this hip is allow us to get the current
 

839
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,430
this hip is allow us to get the current
smallest

840
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
smallest
 

841
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,070
smallest
audi number all right eric please don't

842
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
audi number all right eric please don't
 

843
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,110
audi number all right eric please don't
do that

844
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
do that
 

845
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,430
do that
and then look would we tell we repeat

846
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
and then look would we tell we repeat
 

847
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,190
and then look would we tell we repeat
this end time eric can you tell me

848
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200
this end time eric can you tell me
 

849
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,150
this end time eric can you tell me
what's what's this

850
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
what's what's this
 

851
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,789
what's what's this
current he pull up what does it do

852
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:51,799

 

853
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:58,950

um

854
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960

 

855
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,549

yeah what does it mean it means that

856
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:02,559
yeah what does it mean it means that
 

857
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,710
yeah what does it mean it means that
the current equals heat

858
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:06,720
the current equals heat
 

859
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,150
the current equals heat
sorry so we are taking the

860
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,160
sorry so we are taking the
 

861
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,270
sorry so we are taking the
taking the smallest aggie number from

862
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
taking the smallest aggie number from
 

863
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,909
taking the smallest aggie number from
the here

864
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919
the here
 

865
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,270
the here
here right

866
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280

 

867
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,350

no it's already ugly number because the

868
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,360
no it's already ugly number because the
 

869
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,789
no it's already ugly number because the
first one

870
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:20,799
first one
 

871
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,310
first one
i can multiply 2 3 5 and i put it in

872
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,320
i can multiply 2 3 5 and i put it in
 

873
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,270
i can multiply 2 3 5 and i put it in
here and here and here right look if

874
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280
here and here and here right look if
 

875
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,630
here and here and here right look if
it's not seen

876
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
it's not seen
 

877
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,310
it's not seen
two three five and then the next one is

878
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
two three five and then the next one is
 

879
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,070
two three five and then the next one is
two three five

880
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
two three five
 

881
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,909
two three five
i take it out and i put it two three

882
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
i take it out and i put it two three
 

883
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,830
i take it out and i put it two three
five okay so now you tell me what to do

884
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
five okay so now you tell me what to do
 

885
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,110
five okay so now you tell me what to do
next

886
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120

 

887
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,750

so look at another iteration k-pop right

888
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
so look at another iteration k-pop right
 

889
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,430
so look at another iteration k-pop right
take away two because of the smallest

890
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440

 

891
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,430

and then what multiply by one

892
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,440

 

893
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,230

so it's four six ten right yeah and i

894
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
so it's four six ten right yeah and i
 

895
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,470
so it's four six ten right yeah and i
put it for six ten here right as well

896
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
put it for six ten here right as well
 

897
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,950
put it for six ten here right as well
and then the next one is three i take

898
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
and then the next one is three i take
 

899
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,909
and then the next one is three i take
the three

900
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
the three
 

901
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,029
the three
and i times eight five two

902
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
and i times eight five two
 

903
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,710
and i times eight five two
six five that will be what three times

904
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
six five that will be what three times
 

905
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,750
six five that will be what three times
two

906
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
two
 

907
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,950
two
six five i already have six yeah yeah

908
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:12,960
six five i already have six yeah yeah
 

909
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,390
six five i already have six yeah yeah
and times five ten three nine

910
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
and times five ten three nine
 

911
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,470
and times five ten three nine
right and then you times it by five

912
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
right and then you times it by five
 

913
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,230
right and then you times it by five
fifteen yeah 15

914
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
fifteen yeah 15
 

915
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,669
fifteen yeah 15
okay so does it make sense yeah yeah

916
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
okay so does it make sense yeah yeah
 

917
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,110
okay so does it make sense yeah yeah
yes yeah okay

918
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
yes yeah okay
 

919
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,230
yes yeah okay
15 okay okay so look

920
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
15 okay okay so look
 

921
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,190
15 okay okay so look
so these will be more efficient why is

922
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
so these will be more efficient why is
 

923
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,470
so these will be more efficient why is
that because we're repeating

924
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
that because we're repeating
 

925
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,110
that because we're repeating
n terms and this is our one constant

926
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
n terms and this is our one constant
 

927
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,870
n terms and this is our one constant
right because we're taking

928
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
right because we're taking
 

929
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,029
right because we're taking
we're taking an element from the hip

930
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:43,039
we're taking an element from the hip
 

931
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,110
we're taking an element from the hip
it's one constant right push and pop

932
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
it's one constant right push and pop
 

933
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,710
it's one constant right push and pop
usually right yeah and then look sin

934
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
usually right yeah and then look sin
 

935
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,669
usually right yeah and then look sin
this is a one constant yeah that doesn't

936
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:53,679
this is a one constant yeah that doesn't
 

937
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,870
this is a one constant yeah that doesn't
make sense

938
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:54,880
make sense
 

939
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,270
make sense
why why this is more efficient because

940
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
why why this is more efficient because
 

941
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,070
why why this is more efficient because
we are not dealing with any non-ugly

942
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,080
we are not dealing with any non-ugly
 

943
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,830
we are not dealing with any non-ugly
numbers

944
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:00,840
numbers
 

945
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,830
numbers
right how much does it make sense yeah

946
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
right how much does it make sense yeah
 

947
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,190
right how much does it make sense yeah
look the 7 is not here any anyway we

948
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
look the 7 is not here any anyway we
 

949
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,270
look the 7 is not here any anyway we
don't need to check if 7 is ugly number

950
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
don't need to check if 7 is ugly number
 

951
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,149
don't need to check if 7 is ugly number
or not

952
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
or not
 

953
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,950
or not
right instead we know all we know that

954
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
right instead we know all we know that
 

955
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,510
right instead we know all we know that
every number is the factor of 235

956
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
every number is the factor of 235
 

957
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,750
every number is the factor of 235
so every time we multiply two so if it's

958
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
so every time we multiply two so if it's
 

959
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,510
so every time we multiply two so if it's
still a negative number right

960
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
still a negative number right
 

961
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,630
still a negative number right
yeah it's just how many two how many

962
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
yeah it's just how many two how many
 

963
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,110
yeah it's just how many two how many
threes and how many fives combination

964
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
threes and how many fives combination
 

965
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,909
threes and how many fives combination
right so hip-hop uh it's always one

966
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:27,919
right so hip-hop uh it's always one
 

967
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,549
right so hip-hop uh it's always one
constraint he pushed may not be

968
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
constraint he pushed may not be
 

969
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,350
constraint he pushed may not be
he put when you push something into the

970
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
he put when you push something into the
 

971
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,149
he put when you push something into the
hip

972
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:34,159
hip
 

973
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,230
hip
it's actually all locked in right but

974
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
it's actually all locked in right but
 

975
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,270
it's actually all locked in right but
this is

976
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,280
this is
 

977
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,630
this is
but this does not execute

978
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
but this does not execute
 

979
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,470
but this does not execute
a lot right this is executed

980
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480
a lot right this is executed
 

981
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,390
a lot right this is executed
a lot

hippie fights to turning into the

988
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
hippie fights to turning into the
 

989
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,270
hippie fights to turning into the

turning into
 

991
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,830
turning into
turning in the list into the hip do you

992
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
turning in the list into the hip do you
 

993
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,310
turning in the list into the hip do you
still remember what's hit

994
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320
still remember what's hit
 

995
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,549
still remember what's hit
do you still remember what's hip he

996
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
do you still remember what's hip he
 

997
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,149
do you still remember what's hip he
looked at this

998
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159
looked at this
 

999
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,830
looked at this
remember hip is actually a tree right

1000
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:10,840
remember hip is actually a tree right
 

1001
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,470
remember hip is actually a tree right
look so

1002
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
look so
 

1003
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,870
look so
every time all right look this is look

1004
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:18,880

 

1005
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,870

so it's a data structure tree that

1006
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880

 

1007
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,789

i don't know okay i don't know other

1008
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:26,799
i don't know okay i don't know other
 

1009
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,870
i don't know okay i don't know other
notes but the root of a tree

1010
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
notes but the root of a tree
 

1011
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,029
notes but the root of a tree
is always guaranteed the minimum or

1012
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039
is always guaranteed the minimum or
 

1013
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,789
is always guaranteed the minimum or
maximum right

1014
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
maximum right
 

1015
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,510
maximum right
by default is minimum it's called mean

1016
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520
by default is minimum it's called mean
 

1017
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,390
by default is minimum it's called mean
hip

1018
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:36,400
hip
 

1019
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,149
hip
yeah it's a tree mean here right so look

1020
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
yeah it's a tree mean here right so look
 

1021
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,750
yeah it's a tree mean here right so look
i i know i want to take one element from

1022
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
i i know i want to take one element from
 

1023
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,310
i i know i want to take one element from
the top

1024
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
the top
 

1025
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,950
the top
right so i know it's it's it's always

1026
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
right so i know it's it's it's always
 

1027
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,110
right so i know it's it's it's always
the smallest or the biggest right

1028
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120
the smallest or the biggest right
 

1029
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,310
the smallest or the biggest right
all right does it make sense

1030
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
all right does it make sense
 

1031
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,149
all right does it make sense
yeah that doesn't make sense yeah this

1032
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
yeah that doesn't make sense yeah this
 

1033
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,669
yeah that doesn't make sense yeah this
is the hip maximum

1034
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:55,679
is the hip maximum
 

1035
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,669
is the hip maximum
my maneuver okay so uh i'm going to

1036
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
my maneuver okay so uh i'm going to
 

1037
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,270
my maneuver okay so uh i'm going to
i'm i'm going to take a look okay

1038
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
i'm i'm going to take a look okay
 

1039
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,510
i'm i'm going to take a look okay
i'm going to erase these i erase

1040
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520

 

1041
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,270

okay so you tell me what to do okay

1042
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
okay so you tell me what to do okay
 

1043
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,310
okay so you tell me what to do okay
don't look at my nose okay but i am two

1044
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320
don't look at my nose okay but i am two
 

1045
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:26,549
don't look at my nose okay but i am two
three five oh you like it i guess sorry

1046
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559

 

1047
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,549

no i'm just looking into something okay

1048
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
no i'm just looking into something okay
 

1049
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,830
no i'm just looking into something okay
i

1050
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:34,840

 

1051
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,430

in

1052
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
in
 

1053
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,870
in
what do you think i guess two

1054
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880

 

1055
00:23:42,880 --> 00:24:10,950

yeah three five

1056
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:10,960

 

1057
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,990

so what do we do there for i we multiply

1058
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
so what do we do there for i we multiply
 

1059
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,470
so what do we do there for i we multiply
if

1060
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
if
 

1061
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,669
if
if the number is not in a

1062
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
if the number is not in a
 

1063
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,630
if the number is not in a
we need to push it into the left left

1064
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
we need to push it into the left left
 

1065
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,269
we need to push it into the left left
hip push

1066
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
hip push
 

1067
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,590
hip push
and i also need to put it into the scene

1068
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
and i also need to put it into the scene
 

1069
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,390
and i also need to put it into the scene
right

1070
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
right
 

1071
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,990
right
we also need to put it in the scene

1072
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,000
we also need to put it in the scene
 

1073
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,990
we also need to put it in the scene
right

1074
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
right
 

1075
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:44,830
right
yeah how do we do that

1076
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,840

 

1077
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:58,390

thingy

1078
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,400

 

1079
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,310

what are we pushing with and then we

1080
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,320
what are we pushing with and then we
 

1081
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,149
what are we pushing with and then we
want to need and the common

1082
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
want to need and the common
 

1083
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,070
want to need and the common
arcade number is new right so we just

1084
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,080
arcade number is new right so we just
 

1085
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,190
arcade number is new right so we just
need to add this

1086
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,200
need to add this
 

1087
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,310
need to add this
to remember in the new right yeah

1088
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,320
to remember in the new right yeah
 

1089
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,350
to remember in the new right yeah
yeah add new yes

1090
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,360
yeah add new yes
 

1091
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,630
yeah add new yes
new okay okay

1092
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
new okay okay
 

1093
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,990
new okay okay
[Music]

1094
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
[Music]
 

1095
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,630
[Music]
and new and new with the bracket okay

1096
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
and new and new with the bracket okay
 

1097
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,230
and new and new with the bracket okay
okay so i

1098
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
okay so i
 

1099
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,549
okay so i
so okay so i i need to correct something

1100
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
so okay so i i need to correct something
 

1101
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,310
so okay so i i need to correct something
so when we retrieve the

1102
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
so when we retrieve the
 

1103
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,510
so when we retrieve the
value from the load the the load

1104
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,520
value from the load the the load
 

1105
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,590
value from the load the the load
is a one but if we want to remove it

1106
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,600
is a one but if we want to remove it
 

1107
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,870
is a one but if we want to remove it
it's all locked in

1108
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:30,880
it's all locked in
 

1109
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,430
it's all locked in
the same thing as a key push it's

1110
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440
the same thing as a key push it's
 

1111
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,190
the same thing as a key push it's
usually all locked in right because you

1112
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
usually all locked in right because you
 

1113
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,750
usually all locked in right because you
need to

1114
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
need to
 

1115
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,789
need to
arrange rearrange the the hip

1116
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:38,799
arrange rearrange the the hip
 

1117
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,950
arrange rearrange the the hip
at some point right but why this is

1118
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:40,960
at some point right but why this is
 

1119
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,789
at some point right but why this is
still faster

1120
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:42,799
still faster
 

1121
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,470
still faster
because because the numbers in the hip

1122
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
because because the numbers in the hip
 

1123
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,590
because because the numbers in the hip
here is usually smaller right

1124
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:49,600
here is usually smaller right
 

1125
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,870
here is usually smaller right
it it it contains the rb number right

1126
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:52,880
it it it contains the rb number right
 

1127
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,789
it it it contains the rb number right
it's not it's the argument it does not

1128
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:54,799
it's not it's the argument it does not
 

1129
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,190
it's not it's the argument it does not
contain any non-ugly numbers right

1130
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,200
contain any non-ugly numbers right
 

1131
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,310
contain any non-ugly numbers right
all right yeah okay so that's why this

1132
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
all right yeah okay so that's why this
 

1133
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,029
all right yeah okay so that's why this
approach is

1134
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
approach is
 

1135
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,549
approach is
much faster than the previous one

1136
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
much faster than the previous one
 

1137
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,470
much faster than the previous one
because for example if there are

1138
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
because for example if there are
 

1139
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,789
because for example if there are
many many prime numbers which are bigger

1140
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
many many prime numbers which are bigger
 

1141
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,549
many many prime numbers which are bigger
than five it's not a big number you

1142
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
than five it's not a big number you
 

1143
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,630
than five it's not a big number you
still have to check it you still have to

1144
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:10,640
still have to check it you still have to
 

1145
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,750
still have to check it you still have to
check it right

1146
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
check it right
 

1147
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,470
check it right
yeah doesn't make sense okay so can can

1148
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
yeah doesn't make sense okay so can can
 

1149
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,039
yeah doesn't make sense okay so can can
you say bye bye see you tomorrow
