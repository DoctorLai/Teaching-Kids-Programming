so remember what we have talked about

8
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
so remember what we have talked about
 

9
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,430
so remember what we have talked about
yesterday

10
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
yesterday
 

11
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,349
yesterday
we talked about

12
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
we talked about
 

13
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,390
we talked about
dynamics programming yes well

14
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
dynamics programming yes well
 

15
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,630
dynamics programming yes well
dynamic programming okay so basic

16
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
dynamic programming okay so basic
 

17
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,630
dynamic programming okay so basic
dynamic programming is an

18
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
dynamic programming is an
 

19
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,670
dynamic programming is an
optimization technique yeah to

20
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,680
optimization technique yeah to
 

21
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,710
optimization technique yeah to
speed up your algorithm right it's kind

22
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
speed up your algorithm right it's kind
 

23
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,830
speed up your algorithm right it's kind
of like a

24
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
of like a
 

25
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,030
of like a
you ask computer to remember the things

26
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
you ask computer to remember the things
 

27
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,990
you ask computer to remember the things
it has calculated so it doesn't we

28
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
it has calculated so it doesn't we
 

29
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,830
it has calculated so it doesn't we
calculate those

30
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:39,840
calculate those
 

31
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,190
calculate those
things right again again okay so

32
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
things right again again okay so
 

33
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,750
things right again again okay so
it will save us time so today we're

34
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
it will save us time so today we're
 

35
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,790
it will save us time so today we're
going to talk about

36
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
going to talk about
 

37
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,630
going to talk about
an interesting problem using this

38
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
an interesting problem using this
 

39
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,990
an interesting problem using this
dynamic programming and

40
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
dynamic programming and
 

41
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,950
dynamic programming and
possibly the permutation and combination

42
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
possibly the permutation and combination
 

43
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,510
possibly the permutation and combination
yeah you still remember combination yeah

44
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
yeah you still remember combination yeah
 

45
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,229
yeah you still remember combination yeah
how many apples how many how many apples

46
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
how many apples how many how many apples
 

47
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,590
how many apples how many how many apples
you can pick

48
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
you can pick
 

49
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,150
you can pick
i mean how many ways of picking three

50
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
i mean how many ways of picking three
 

51
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,429
i mean how many ways of picking three
apples out of five

52
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439

 

53
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,390

so what's this number is c five three

54
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
so what's this number is c five three
 

55
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,149
so what's this number is c five three
yeah picking three numbers out of five

56
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
yeah picking three numbers out of five
 

57
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,030
yeah picking three numbers out of five
yeah

58
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
yeah
 

59
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,270
yeah
we love orders yeah so what does it

60
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
we love orders yeah so what does it
 

61
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,109
we love orders yeah so what does it
equal remember

62
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
equal remember
 

63
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,149
equal remember
equals 5 times 4 times

64
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
equals 5 times 4 times
 

65
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,990
equals 5 times 4 times
3 divided by 3 times 2 times 1 okay

66
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
3 divided by 3 times 2 times 1 okay
 

67
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,070
3 divided by 3 times 2 times 1 okay
yeah okay

68
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
yeah okay
 

69
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,270
yeah okay
so it's 10 weights okay so c and m

70
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
so it's 10 weights okay so c and m
 

71
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,870
so it's 10 weights okay so c and m
equals n factorial divided by

72
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
equals n factorial divided by
 

73
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,429
equals n factorial divided by
m factorial divided by n minus m

74
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
m factorial divided by n minus m
 

75
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,149
m factorial divided by n minus m
factorial

76
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
factorial
 

77
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,390
factorial
okay okay yes and c

78
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
okay okay yes and c
 

79
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,830
okay okay yes and c
5 3 is equal to c phi 2 okay

80
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
5 3 is equal to c phi 2 okay
 

81
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,429
5 3 is equal to c phi 2 okay
it's the same because if you there are

82
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
it's the same because if you there are
 

83
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,109
it's the same because if you there are
five airplanes and if you pick the three

84
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
five airplanes and if you pick the three
 

85
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:47,830
five airplanes and if you pick the three
apples

86
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
apples
 

87
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,270
apples
you also have a solution for picking two

88
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
you also have a solution for picking two
 

89
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,350
you also have a solution for picking two
apples all right

90
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
apples all right
 

91
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,670
apples all right
yeah okay so now how about if i give you

92
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
yeah okay so now how about if i give you
 

93
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,469
yeah okay so now how about if i give you
a

94
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
a
 

95
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,830
a
a grid a grade a grid

96
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
a grid a grade a grid
 

97
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,870
a grid a grade a grid
like three

98
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
like three
 

99
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,790
like three
and then four maybe

100
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
and then four maybe
 

101
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,750
and then four maybe
so eric you are here yeah are we where

102
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
so eric you are here yeah are we where
 

103

ever getting ryan is here right
 

107
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,309
ever getting ryan is here right
at the top left corner uh

108
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319

 

109
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,790

possibly that's not not not the corner

110
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
possibly that's not not not the corner
 

111
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,589
possibly that's not not not the corner
okay

112
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
okay
 

113
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,470
okay
let's let's put it in here okay you can

114
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
let's let's put it in here okay you can
 

115
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,350
let's let's put it in here okay you can
walk in the square

116
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
walk in the square
 

117
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,390
walk in the square
what so yeah here and then why anything

118
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
what so yeah here and then why anything
 

119
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,630
what so yeah here and then why anything
why are we naked

120
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
why are we naked
 

121
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,670
why are we naked
i know okay everyone here yeah you can

122

i know okay everyone here yeah you can
 

123
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,589
i know okay everyone here yeah you can
okay what's this direction that's east

124
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
okay what's this direction that's east
 

125
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,949
okay what's this direction that's east
yeah yeah

126
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
yeah yeah
 

127
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,990
yeah yeah
let's let's uh stop yes yes

128
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
let's let's uh stop yes yes
 

129
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,550
let's let's uh stop yes yes
so look you're at the top left corner

130
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
so look you're at the top left corner
 

131
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,030
so look you're at the top left corner
and then

132
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
and then
 

133
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,070
and then
every time you can walk one step

134
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
every time you can walk one step
 

135
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,150
every time you can walk one step
to the east or to the south but you

136
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
to the east or to the south but you
 

137
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,990
to the east or to the south but you
cannot you cannot go to the north and

138
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
cannot you cannot go to the north and
 

139
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,470
cannot you cannot go to the north and
the

140
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
the
 

141
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,589
the
west why i say so

142
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
west why i say so
 

143
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,869
west why i say so
okay okay because

yeah because i say so doesn't
 

147
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,630
yeah because i say so doesn't
make it more detailed

148
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
make it more detailed
 

149
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,390
make it more detailed
not about detail okay so that's supposed

150
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
not about detail okay so that's supposed
 

151
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,990
not about detail okay so that's supposed
to you can only walk eastern

152
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
to you can only walk eastern
 

153

or you can do this here lots of ways
 

171
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,430
or you can do this here lots of ways
this is too

172
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
this is too
 

173
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,670
this is too
too uh a bit complicated how about these

174
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
too uh a bit complicated how about these
 

175
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,830
too uh a bit complicated how about these
just two squares you and you're here

176
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
just two squares you and you're here
 

177
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,589
just two squares you and you're here
and you want to go through here how many

178
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
and you want to go through here how many
 

179
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,589
and you want to go through here how many
ways

180
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
ways
 

181
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,789
ways
two yeah yeah there's three there's one

182
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
two yeah yeah there's three there's one
 

183
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,270
two yeah yeah there's three there's one
three

184
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
three
 

185
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,309
three
all four okay okay three four one

186
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
all four okay okay three four one
 

187
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,949
all four okay okay three four one
right so look at how what why you

188
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
right so look at how what why you
 

189
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,789
right so look at how what why you
wouldn't say this is true this is easy

190
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
wouldn't say this is true this is easy
 

191
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,350
wouldn't say this is true this is easy
right

192
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
right
 

193
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,789
right
yeah because

194
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
yeah because
 

195
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,710
yeah because
because

196
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720

 

197
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,550

yeah so how many ways i you want to go

198
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
yeah so how many ways i you want to go
 

199
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,270
yeah so how many ways i you want to go
to the

200
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
to the
 

201
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,550
to the
right top uh right bottom corner

202
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
right top uh right bottom corner
 

203
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,869
right top uh right bottom corner
three one two

204
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
three one two
 

205
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,069
three one two
three yes three it just

206
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
three yes three it just
 

207
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,349
three yes three it just
so how can we uh

208
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
so how can we uh
 

209
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,189
so how can we uh
so it's that way we can count it huh

210
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199

 

211
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,310

so let's suppose they are n

212
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
so let's suppose they are n
 

213
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,469
so let's suppose they are n
they are n squared if that's not you

214
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
they are n squared if that's not you
 

215
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,670
they are n squared if that's not you
just divided by

216
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
just divided by
 

217
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,550
just divided by
2 or something no not even because look

218
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
2 or something no not even because look
 

219
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,950
2 or something no not even because look
there are

220
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
there are
 

221
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,070
there are
n squares vertically

222
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
n squares vertically
 

223
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,870
n squares vertically
and m squares horizontally

224
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
and m squares horizontally
 

225
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,310
and m squares horizontally
so let's change blue pin yeah

226
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
so let's change blue pin yeah
 

227
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,430
so let's change blue pin yeah
so look how many ways i need to

228
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
so look how many ways i need to
 

229
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,710
so look how many ways i need to
e1 how many way how many steps from the

230
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
e1 how many way how many steps from the
 

231
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,070
e1 how many way how many steps from the
left top right top left corner to the uh

232
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
left top right top left corner to the uh
 

233
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,510
left top right top left corner to the uh
bottom right corner how many steps

234
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
bottom right corner how many steps
 

235
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,950
bottom right corner how many steps
how many steps so in order to work one

236
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
how many steps so in order to work one
 

237
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,150
how many steps so in order to work one
two three four five

238
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
two three four five
 

239
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,510
two three four five
five step yeah yes one two three four

240
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
five step yeah yes one two three four
 

241
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,790
five step yeah yes one two three four
one two three so seven

242
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
one two three so seven
 

243
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,990
one two three so seven
no one two three four five five steps

244
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
no one two three four five five steps
 

245
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,590
no one two three four five five steps
also they can be like this uh

246
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
also they can be like this uh
 

247
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,270
also they can be like this uh
different steps no no you cannot go up

248
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
different steps no no you cannot go up
 

249
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,390
different steps no no you cannot go up
so look one

250
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
so look one
 

251
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,270
so look one
two three four five one two three four

252
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
two three four five one two three four
 

253
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,990
two three four five one two three four
five

254
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
five
 

255
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,749
five
one two three four five do you still

256
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
one two three four five do you still
 

257
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,189
one two three four five do you still
still get it oh yeah

258
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
still get it oh yeah
 

259
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,629
still get it oh yeah
so home the the the total steps is fixed

260
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
so home the the the total steps is fixed
 

261
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,909
so home the the the total steps is fixed
so it equals m plus m minus one right

262
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
so it equals m plus m minus one right
 

263
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,430
so it equals m plus m minus one right
because the first step doesn't count

264
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
because the first step doesn't count
 

265
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,590
because the first step doesn't count
yeah you need to minus it right

266
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
yeah you need to minus it right
 

267
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,870
yeah you need to minus it right
yeah yeah okay yes

268
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880

 

269
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,710

so look at this one how many steps

270
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720

 

271
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,870

how many

272
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880

 

273
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,990

yeah one two three and

274
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
yeah one two three and
 

275
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,029
yeah one two three and
one two three okay one

276
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
one two three okay one
 

277
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,469
one two three okay one
two three so look

278
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479

 

279
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,830

so how many steps going going

280
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
so how many steps going going
 

281
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,749
so how many steps going going
to the south

282
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759

 

283
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,070

how many steps do you need to go to to

284
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
how many steps do you need to go to to
 

285
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,950
how many steps do you need to go to to
the south here

286
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
the south here
 

287
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,230
the south here
if two which is m

288
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
if two which is m
 

289
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,629
if two which is m
minus one yeah minus one so you're going

290
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
minus one yeah minus one so you're going
 

291
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,670
minus one yeah minus one so you're going
to solve n

292
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
to solve n
 

293
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,670
to solve n
minus one okay are you going to know

294
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
minus one okay are you going to know
 

295
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,189
minus one okay are you going to know
north you need how many one

296
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
north you need how many one
 

297
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,550
north you need how many one
three which is that's east

298
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
three which is that's east
 

299
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,590
three which is that's east
which is which is

300
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
which is which is
 

301
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,990
which is which is
m minus one one two three

302
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
m minus one one two three
 

303
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,590
m minus one one two three
okay so uh one two three yeah okay

304
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
okay so uh one two three yeah okay
 

305
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:56,150
okay so uh one two three yeah okay
y is minus n plus n minus one

306
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160

 

307
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,589

one one two three so n minus one

308
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
one one two three so n minus one
 

309
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,870
one one two three so n minus one
okay yeah so look they are n

310
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
okay yeah so look they are n
 

311
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,029
okay yeah so look they are n
minus one to the south and minus one to

312
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
minus one to the south and minus one to
 

313
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,309
minus one to the south and minus one to
the east

314
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
the east
 

315
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,790
the east
so all together is m plus n minus two

316
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
so all together is m plus n minus two
 

317
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,550
so all together is m plus n minus two
okay so actually it's a minus center

318
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
okay so actually it's a minus center
 

319
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,510
okay so actually it's a minus center
three plus

320
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
three plus
 

321
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,550
three plus
four three plus four seven minus two

322
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
four three plus four seven minus two
 

323
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,830
four three plus four seven minus two
okay yeah this is five right one two

324
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
okay yeah this is five right one two
 

325
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,430
okay yeah this is five right one two
three four five it's right it's

326
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
three four five it's right it's
 

327
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,629
three four five it's right it's
minus two okay yeah

328
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
minus two okay yeah
 

329
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,390
minus two okay yeah
so of all these steps this is total step

330
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
so of all these steps this is total step
 

331
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,749
so of all these steps this is total step
and i want to pick number

332
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
and i want to pick number
 

333
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,070
and i want to pick number
the the number of south

334
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080

 

335
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,270

does it make sense yeah

336
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
does it make sense yeah
 

337
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,950
does it make sense yeah
so for example this one they are

338
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
so for example this one they are
 

339
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,350
so for example this one they are
one step to the north and then there are

340
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
one step to the north and then there are
 

341
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,070
one step to the north and then there are
one two two steps to the to the south to

342
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
one two two steps to the to the south to
 

343
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,070
one two two steps to the to the south to
the east so how many way how many steps

344
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
the east so how many way how many steps
 

345
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,189
the east so how many way how many steps
three steps yeah yes so let's

346
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
three steps yeah yes so let's
 

347
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,830
three steps yeah yes so let's
follow those three steps i want to pick

348
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
follow those three steps i want to pick
 

349
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,189
follow those three steps i want to pick
one step to the north

350
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
one step to the north
 

351
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,869
one step to the north
then that's the number of waves am i

352
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
then that's the number of waves am i
 

353
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,230
then that's the number of waves am i
right

354
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
right
 

355
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,629
right
so let the how many waves of this is c

356
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
so let the how many waves of this is c
 

357
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,869
so let the how many waves of this is c
two plus one and mark one all right

358
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
two plus one and mark one all right
 

359
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,710
two plus one and mark one all right
yeah does it make sense look look

360
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
yeah does it make sense look look
 

361
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,749
yeah does it make sense look look
so this is the total of steps

362
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
so this is the total of steps
 

363
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,510
so this is the total of steps
and among that i can pick i need to pick

364
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
and among that i can pick i need to pick
 

365
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,309
and among that i can pick i need to pick
the steps n minus one steps to the south

366
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
the steps n minus one steps to the south
 

367
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:22,710
the steps n minus one steps to the south
or

368
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
or
 

369
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,430
or
a minus one step to the east so the

370
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
a minus one step to the east so the
 

371
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,990
a minus one step to the east so the
number of

372
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
number of
 

373
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,270
number of
ways is c n plus

374
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
ways is c n plus
 

375
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,870
ways is c n plus
m minus two n minus one or

376
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
m minus two n minus one or
 

377
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,990
m minus two n minus one or
because this is two equal right c m plus

378
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
because this is two equal right c m plus
 

379
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,230
because this is two equal right c m plus
m minus two n minus one okay so these

380
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
m minus two n minus one okay so these
 

381
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,389
m minus two n minus one okay so these
these two are equal right remember

382
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
these two are equal right remember
 

383
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,230
these two are equal right remember
because these two added together would

384
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
because these two added together would
 

385
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,190
because these two added together would
be the least

386
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
be the least
 

387
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,190
be the least
we still still remember c n m equals c

388
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
we still still remember c n m equals c
 

389
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,990
we still still remember c n m equals c
n n minus n remember

390
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
n n minus n remember
 

391
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,350
n n minus n remember
yeah this is remember this yeah

392
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
yeah this is remember this yeah
 

393
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,350
yeah this is remember this yeah
no one will just talk about it picking

394
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
no one will just talk about it picking
 

395
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,269
no one will just talk about it picking
three apples after five is the same as

396
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
three apples after five is the same as
 

397
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,389
three apples after five is the same as
speaking to apples

398
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
speaking to apples
 

399
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:12,150
speaking to apples
out of five am i yes

400
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160

 

401
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,949

n is bigger this is the total number of

402
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
n is bigger this is the total number of
 

403
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,710
n is bigger this is the total number of
apples this is five plus

404
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
apples this is five plus
 

405
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,350
apples this is five plus
five plus i only pick three it's the

406
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
five plus i only pick three it's the
 

407
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,230
five plus i only pick three it's the
same as five

408
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
same as five
 

409
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,710
same as five
i want to pick five minus three two

410
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
i want to pick five minus three two
 

411
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,509
i want to pick five minus three two
apples here

412
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
apples here
 

413
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,710
apples here
got it yeah so look the total number of

414
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
got it yeah so look the total number of
 

415
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,550
got it yeah so look the total number of
apples is n plus and minus

416
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
apples is n plus and minus
 

417
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,670
apples is n plus and minus
two right i want to pick a minus and one

418
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
two right i want to pick a minus and one
 

419
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,670
two right i want to pick a minus and one
apple to decide to go to the south so

420
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
apple to decide to go to the south so
 

421
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,110
apple to decide to go to the south so
this is the number of ways

422
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
this is the number of ways
 

423
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,470
this is the number of ways
to get it yeah do you get it

424
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
to get it yeah do you get it
 

425
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,509
to get it yeah do you get it
so how many ways is this five

426
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
so how many ways is this five
 

427
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,790
so how many ways is this five
no no no no look n is

428
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
no no no no look n is
 

429
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,870
no no no no look n is
one two three m is seven so c five

430
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
one two three m is seven so c five
 

431
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,630
one two three m is seven so c five
two what's c by two

432
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
two what's c by two
 

433
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,750
two what's c by two
five times four divided by two

434
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
five times four divided by two
 

435
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,310
five times four divided by two
is ten way they're all there ten ways

436
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
is ten way they're all there ten ways
 

437
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,389
is ten way they're all there ten ways
let's let's verify it okay

438
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
let's let's verify it okay
 

439
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,509
let's let's verify it okay
ten ways one two three four five

440
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
ten ways one two three four five
 

441
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,190
ten ways one two three four five
here one two three four five yeah

442
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
here one two three four five yeah
 

443
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,389
here one two three four five yeah
yeah two three

444
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
yeah two three
 

445
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,630
yeah two three
okay four

446
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
okay four
 

447
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,590
okay four
five six

448
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
five six
 

449
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,069
five six
seven eight nine

450
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
seven eight nine
 

451
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,430
seven eight nine
ten correct so that's him yeah

452
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
ten correct so that's him yeah
 

453
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,949
ten correct so that's him yeah
so as long as we know the n and m

454
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
so as long as we know the n and m
 

455
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,470
so as long as we know the n and m
we know the mathematics ways to

456
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
we know the mathematics ways to
 

457
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,790
we know the mathematics ways to
calculate it the number of ways

458
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
calculate it the number of ways
 

459
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,550
calculate it the number of ways
got it does it make sense

460
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
got it does it make sense
 

461
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,949
got it does it make sense
okay so look this is the

462
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
okay so look this is the
 

463
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,110
okay so look this is the
mathematic way of doing this okay so

464
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
mathematic way of doing this okay so
 

465
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,710
mathematic way of doing this okay so
how can we calculate it remember look

466
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
how can we calculate it remember look
 

467
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,910
how can we calculate it remember look
look eric

468
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920

 

469
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,829

define this is right here

470
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839
define this is right here
 

471
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,710
define this is right here
define f

472
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
define f
 

473
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,990
define f
and then m yeah

474
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
and then m yeah
 

475
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,710
and then m yeah
look at previously with n so the number

476
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
look at previously with n so the number
 

477
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,470
look at previously with n so the number
of voice is what

478
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
of voice is what
 

479
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,910
of voice is what
we want to know this cm plus m

480
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920

 

481
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,269

uh minus one minus two

482
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
uh minus one minus two
 

483
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,949
uh minus one minus two
and minus one yeah we want to take the

484
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
and minus one yeah we want to take the
 

485
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,310
and minus one yeah we want to take the
least number yeah

486
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
least number yeah
 

487
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,829
least number yeah
yes yeah okay so

488
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
yes yeah okay so
 

489
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,110
yes yeah okay so
actually actually

490
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120

 

491
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,949

look this is mathematic but

492
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
look this is mathematic but
 

493
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,069
look this is mathematic but
again let's let's see this

494
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
again let's let's see this
 

495
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,350
again let's let's see this
if i'm at this point i'm here

496
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
if i'm at this point i'm here
 

497
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,190
if i'm at this point i'm here
yeah where can i uh

498
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
yeah where can i uh
 

499
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,030
yeah where can i uh
where could the possible letter come

500
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
where could the possible letter come
 

501
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,069
where could the possible letter come
from which place which two

502
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
from which place which two
 

503
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,710
from which place which two
i'm at this is the beginning so if

504
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
i'm at this is the beginning so if
 

505
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,269
i'm at this is the beginning so if
someone

506
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
someone
 

507
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,389
someone
somehow i'm at this point so

508
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
somehow i'm at this point so
 

509
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,350
somehow i'm at this point so
where where was where i where was i in

510
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
where where was where i where was i in
 

511
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,550
where where was where i where was i in
the previous step

512
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
the previous step
 

513
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,750
the previous step
where where where could i come from

514
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
where where where could i come from
 

515
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,629
where where where could i come from
it's cleanest top left corner yeah this

516
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
it's cleanest top left corner yeah this
 

517
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,550
it's cleanest top left corner yeah this
is the starting point and you can only

518
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
is the starting point and you can only
 

519
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,470
is the starting point and you can only
go to the south and to the east and go

520
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
go to the south and to the east and go
 

521
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,110
go to the south and to the east and go
to the south so

522
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
to the south so
 

523
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,230
to the south so
i'm here where could i possibly go

524
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
i'm here where could i possibly go
 

525
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,990
i'm here where could i possibly go
only here yeah so here and here right

526
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
only here yeah so here and here right
 

527
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,670
only here yeah so here and here right
you could the previous section could

528
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
you could the previous section could
 

529
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,069
you could the previous section could
only be here and here right

530
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
only be here and here right
 

531
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,470
only be here and here right
okay so suppose there are only one way

532
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
okay so suppose there are only one way
 

533
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,509
okay so suppose there are only one way
come here

534
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
come here
 

535
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,670
come here
one way come here yeah and there's only

536
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
one way come here yeah and there's only
 

537
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,949
one way come here yeah and there's only
one way come here

538
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
one way come here
 

539
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,670
one way come here
so how many ways can i come here two

540
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
so how many ways can i come here two
 

541
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,590
so how many ways can i come here two
yeah because here and here

542
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
yeah because here and here
 

543
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,949
yeah because here and here
got it so look

544
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
got it so look
 

545
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,910
got it so look
this is original f zero f zero okay f

546
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920
this is original f zero f zero okay f
 

547
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,389
this is original f zero f zero okay f
zero

548
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
zero
 

549
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,829
zero
zero equals one okay and then here

550
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
zero equals one okay and then here
 

551
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,670
zero equals one okay and then here
here suppose this is f n m right

552
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
here suppose this is f n m right
 

553
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,949
here suppose this is f n m right
so what does the equal f and m

554
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
so what does the equal f and m
 

555
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,550
so what does the equal f and m
equals 1 here

556
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
equals 1 here
 

557
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,590
equals 1 here
f n n minus 1

558
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
f n n minus 1
 

559
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:13,990
f n n minus 1
plus here what's here f

560
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000

 

561
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,670

in order to calculate this i need to

562
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
in order to calculate this i need to
 

563
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,430
in order to calculate this i need to
catch at least and this because

564
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
catch at least and this because
 

565
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,030
catch at least and this because
if i know they are baby 20 ways

566
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
if i know they are baby 20 ways
 

567
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,310
if i know they are baby 20 ways
to come here and then there are 30 ways

568
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
to come here and then there are 30 ways
 

569
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,150
to come here and then there are 30 ways
to come here so how many ways i can come

570
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
to come here so how many ways i can come
 

571
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,550
to come here so how many ways i can come
here

572
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560

 

573
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,310

if there are 20 ways i can reach this

574
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
if there are 20 ways i can reach this
 

575
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,990
if there are 20 ways i can reach this
point and 30 ways i can reach

576
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
point and 30 ways i can reach
 

577
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,790
point and 30 ways i can reach
this one how many ways i can come here

578
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
this one how many ways i can come here
 

579
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,629
this one how many ways i can come here
please from this

580
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639

 

581
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,910

place on this right

582
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920

 

583
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,509

why is it 25 i just sent eddie together

584
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
why is it 25 i just sent eddie together
 

585
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,550
why is it 25 i just sent eddie together
what do you think

586
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,560
what do you think
 

587
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,590
what do you think
why would you thinking yes 50.

588
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
why would you thinking yes 50.
 

589
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,470
why would you thinking yes 50.
look so the target is i then i can

590
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
look so the target is i then i can
 

591
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,590
look so the target is i then i can
calculate this point yeah because

592
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
calculate this point yeah because
 

593
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,350
calculate this point yeah because
because i can kick a previous two and

594
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
because i can kick a previous two and
 

595
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,790
because i can kick a previous two and
then previously so

596
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
then previously so
 

597
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,350
then previously so
remember what is this similar to

598
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
remember what is this similar to
 

599
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,230
remember what is this similar to
fibonacci number

600
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
fibonacci number
 

601
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,949
fibonacci number
yeah the fibonacci number look f n

602
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
yeah the fibonacci number look f n
 

603
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:09,509
yeah the fibonacci number look f n
equals

604
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:09,519
equals
 

605
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,590
equals
f n minus 1 plus f minus 2 right

606
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
f n minus 1 plus f minus 2 right
 

607
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,350
f n minus 1 plus f minus 2 right
yeah it depends on previous steps and

608
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
yeah it depends on previous steps and
 

609
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,110
yeah it depends on previous steps and
remember how many dynamic programming

610
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
remember how many dynamic programming
 

611
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,790
remember how many dynamic programming
can we

612
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
can we
 

613
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,230
can we
can we use how many ways of dynamic

614
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
can we use how many ways of dynamic
 

615
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,310
can we use how many ways of dynamic
programming

616
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320

 

617
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,230

i give you i think top down and

618
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240

 

619
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,030

top down and what what's the other way

620
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
top down and what what's the other way
 

621
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,310
top down and what what's the other way
and what no butter

622
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
and what no butter
 

623
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,990
and what no butter
up come on you forgot remember

624
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000

 

625
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,670

remember yesterday we talked about top

626
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
remember yesterday we talked about top
 

627
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,750
remember yesterday we talked about top
down f n calculate from f

628
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
down f n calculate from f
 

629
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,150
down f n calculate from f
n and then i want to calculate f minus

630
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
n and then i want to calculate f minus
 

631
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,110
n and then i want to calculate f minus
one

632
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
one
 

633
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,230
one
and then again again calculate f 10 f

634
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
and then again again calculate f 10 f
 

635
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,110
and then again again calculate f 10 f
0 and f and bottom up is calculated

636
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
0 and f and bottom up is calculated
 

637
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,949
0 and f and bottom up is calculated
starting from f0

638
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
starting from f0
 

639
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,189
starting from f0
and f1 f2 got it the same thing here

640
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
and f1 f2 got it the same thing here
 

641
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,269
and f1 f2 got it the same thing here
top down top down is that

642
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:09,279
top down top down is that
 

643
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,430
top down top down is that
i want to calculate a way to get the

644
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
i want to calculate a way to get the
 

645
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,550
i want to calculate a way to get the
number of ways of

646
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
number of ways of
 

647
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,150
number of ways of
getting this the right button turner

648
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
getting this the right button turner
 

649
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,870
getting this the right button turner
yeah then i need to calculate these two

650
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
yeah then i need to calculate these two
 

651
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,389
yeah then i need to calculate these two
right yeah in order to do like that i

652
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
right yeah in order to do like that i
 

653
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,750
right yeah in order to do like that i
need to calculate these two

654
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
need to calculate these two
 

655
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,550
need to calculate these two
all right this is called top bottom top

656
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
all right this is called top bottom top
 

657
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:39,269
all right this is called top bottom top
down

658
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279

 

659
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,910

then i can i can i know the the number

660
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
then i can i can i know the the number
 

661
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,949
then i can i can i know the the number
of ways i can

662
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
of ways i can
 

663
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,189
of ways i can
get here and get here and from this

664
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
get here and get here and from this
 

665
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,710
get here and get here and from this
point i can get here

666
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
point i can get here
 

667
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,069
point i can get here
why because this each number is the sum

668

685
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,430
1 3 3 1 each number is the sum of
its above and the left got it

686
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
its above and the left got it
 

687
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,389
its above and the left got it
okay at least it can also be calculated

688
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
okay at least it can also be calculated
 

689
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,829
okay at least it can also be calculated
from top down

690
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
from top down
 

691
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,710
from top down
or butter up okay top down is i want to

692
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
or butter up okay top down is i want to
 

693
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,629
or butter up okay top down is i want to
calculate

calculate
 

695
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,990
calculate
i want to calculate this and i go go

696
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
i want to calculate this and i go go
 

697
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,829
i want to calculate this and i go go
actually is the opposite i go take a

698
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
actually is the opposite i go take a
 

699
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,590
actually is the opposite i go take a
list with the three and then i need to

700
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
list with the three and then i need to
 

701
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,509
list with the three and then i need to
kick at least two and if i on the table

702
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
kick at least two and if i on the table
 

703
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,430
kick at least two and if i on the table
at least i need to kick at least this

704
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
at least i need to kick at least this
 

705
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,430
at least i need to kick at least this
a button up is that i calculate from the

706
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
a button up is that i calculate from the
 

707
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,030
a button up is that i calculate from the
first first row

708
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
first first row
 

709
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,110
first first row
and then keep going keep going until i

710
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
and then keep going keep going until i
 

711
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,749
and then keep going keep going until i
reach the number i want okay

712
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
reach the number i want okay
 

713
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:47,110
reach the number i want okay
so here again

714

725
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,870

all the oh column yeah and it was zero

726
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
all the oh column yeah and it was zero
 

727
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,710
all the oh column yeah and it was zero
return what how many ways can you do it

728
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
return what how many ways can you do it
 

729
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,510
return what how many ways can you do it
how many if i'm here how many ways i can

come from here
 

733
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,789
come from here
one how many ways i can come here

734
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
one how many ways i can come here
 

735
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,630
one how many ways i can come here
one yeah because the first row and first

736
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
one yeah because the first row and first
 

737
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,870
one yeah because the first row and first
column is always one all right

738
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
column is always one all right
 

739
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,870
column is always one all right
yeah yeah because you can only go to the

as much as i can so meaning that if i

836
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
as much as i can so meaning that if i
 

837
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,270
as much as i can so meaning that if i
see this parameter

838
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
see this parameter
 

839
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,710
see this parameter
n and m if you give me f 2 2

840
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,720
n and m if you give me f 2 2
 

841
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,990
n and m if you give me f 2 2
and i have already calculated f 2 2

842
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
and i have already calculated f 2 2
 

843
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,070
and i have already calculated f 2 2
then i will immediately return it

844
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
then i will immediately return it
 

845
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,990
then i will immediately return it
without calculating it right

846
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
without calculating it right
 

847
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,070
without calculating it right
without invoking the recursion again and

848
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
without invoking the recursion again and
 

849
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,430
without invoking the recursion again and
again okay

850
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
again okay
 

851
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,230
again okay
yeah okay so this is the magic keyword

852
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240
yeah okay so this is the magic keyword
 

853
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,029
yeah okay so this is the magic keyword
okay

854
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
okay
 

855
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,350
okay
to save you from implementing the

856
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
to save you from implementing the
 

857
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,789
to save you from implementing the
notebook

858
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
notebook
 

859
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,710
notebook
okay so from the

860
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
okay so from the
 

861
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,950
okay so from the
from the button up button

862
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:28,960
from the button up button
 

863
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,710
from the button up button
define f and m column

864
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:32,720
define f and m column
 

865
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,750
define f and m column
so look we need to put it in the array

866
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
so look we need to put it in the array
 

867
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,390
so look we need to put it in the array
right

868
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,400
right
 

869
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,070
right
so look dt equals

870
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
so look dt equals
 

871
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,870
so look dt equals
we will create a two dimensional array

872
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
we will create a two dimensional array
 

873
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,110
we will create a two dimensional array
yeah

874
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,120
yeah
 

875
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,390
yeah
zero for we at least

876
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
zero for we at least
 

877
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,669
zero for we at least
specify the for i

878
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:51,679
specify the for i
 

879
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,909
specify the for i
in range m

880
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
in range m
 

881
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,669
in range m
and then actually it's here

882
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
and then actually it's here
 

883
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,110
and then actually it's here
it's been 21 minutes okay for j

884
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
it's been 21 minutes okay for j
 

885
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,909
it's been 21 minutes okay for j
in j range m okay

886
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
in j range m okay
 

887
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,510
in j range m okay
and m so this is n this is m okay so now

888
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
and m so this is n this is m okay so now
 

889
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,830
and m so this is n this is m okay so now
we have this tp which is two dimensional

890
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
we have this tp which is two dimensional
 

891
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,029
we have this tp which is two dimensional
way to tell me

892
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039
way to tell me
 

893
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,909
way to tell me
and then i can i need to specify the for

894
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
and then i can i need to specify the for
 

895
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,950
and then i can i need to specify the for
i

896
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
i
 

897
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,549
i
for row in branch

898
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
for row in branch
 

899
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,549
for row in branch
this is a bit complicated when you end

900
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
this is a bit complicated when you end
 

901
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,909
this is a bit complicated when you end
okay so n runs

902
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
okay so n runs
 

903
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,190
okay so n runs
and then i can say dp

904
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200

 

905
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,590

the first one is is one right the first

906
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
the first one is is one right the first
 

907
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,470
the first one is is one right the first
first column

908
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
first column
 

909
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,789
first column
is one and the same as for c in

910
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
is one and the same as for c in
 

911
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,990
is one and the same as for c in
range m

912
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
range m
 

913
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,789
range m
and dp

914
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799

 

915
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,390

uh actually zero c equals one okay so

916
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
uh actually zero c equals one okay so
 

917
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,990
uh actually zero c equals one okay so
let's first color first row

918
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
let's first color first row
 

919
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,870
let's first color first row
is one right i put a one here and i put

920
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
is one right i put a one here and i put
 

921
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,669
is one right i put a one here and i put
a one here

922
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,679
a one here
 

923
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,710
a one here
and then for other values in the in in

924
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
and then for other values in the in in
 

925
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,990
and then for other values in the in in
the metric four are in

926
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,000
the metric four are in
 

927
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,350
the metric four are in
range one and

928
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
range one and
 

929
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,630
range one and
four c in range

930
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,640
four c in range
 

931
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,630
four c in range
one c one m okay and then i can do this

932
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,640
one c one m okay and then i can do this
 

933
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,750
one c one m okay and then i can do this
look at it

934
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:15,760
look at it
 

935
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,669
look at it
b p r c equals one

936
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
b p r c equals one
 

937
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,950
b p r c equals one
p rc equals one dp

938
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:22,960
p rc equals one dp
 

939
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,630
p rc equals one dp
r minus one c plus

940
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
r minus one c plus
 

941
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,789
r minus one c plus
plus dp r c minus one okay

942
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
plus dp r c minus one okay
 

943
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,510
plus dp r c minus one okay
yeah yeah so look we're using the four

944
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,520
yeah yeah so look we're using the four
 

945
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,230
yeah yeah so look we're using the four
and this is

946
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
and this is
 

947
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,230
and this is
complexities oh

948
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240

 

949
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,110

m yeah because i need to fill in this

950
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
m yeah because i need to fill in this
 

951
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,149
m yeah because i need to fill in this
metric

952
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:42,159
metric

this magic two-dimensional matrix array
 

955
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,750
this magic two-dimensional matrix array
okay and then the last value i want to

956
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
okay and then the last value i want to
 

957
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,990
okay and then the last value i want to
return is return

958
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
return is return

return is return
return what pp minus one the last row

960
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,520
return what pp minus one the last row
 

961
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,590
return what pp minus one the last row
and the minus one the last column so

962
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,600
and the minus one the last column so
 

963
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,350
and the minus one the last column so
which is the right

964
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
which is the right
 

965
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,310
which is the right
the bottom right column okay button

966
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320
the bottom right column okay button
 

967
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,070
the bottom right column okay button
right here this is called bottom

968
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
right here this is called bottom
 

969
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,909
right here this is called bottom
complexity okay so now one more thing

970
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
complexity okay so now one more thing
 

971
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,789
complexity okay so now one more thing
okay so this is as usual and one more

972
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
okay so this is as usual and one more
 

973
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,110
okay so this is as usual and one more
thing okay so this is a bit tricky but

974
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,120
thing okay so this is a bit tricky but
 

975
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,669
thing okay so this is a bit tricky but
but i think you you you must be clever

976
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
but i think you you you must be clever
 

977
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:14,549
but i think you you you must be clever
to think about it

978
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
to think about it
 

979
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,590
to think about it
yeah look so look again

980
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
yeah look so look again
 

981
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,909
yeah look so look again
this is a map okay suppose i already

982
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
this is a map okay suppose i already
 

983
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,549
this is a map okay suppose i already
give you the answer of f

984
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
give you the answer of f
 

985
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,669
give you the answer of f
f what is that and

986
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
f what is that and

m is the number

988
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
m is the number
 

989
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,630
m is the number
if they are n square okay so

990
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640
if they are n square okay so
 

991
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,909
if they are n square okay so
suppose suppose if there are

992
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:37,919
suppose suppose if there are
 

993
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,110
suppose suppose if there are
n squares n squares this side

994
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
n squares n squares this side
 

995
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,190
n squares n squares this side
and n square this side and then you can

996
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,200
and n square this side and then you can
 

997
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,870
and n square this side and then you can
use this function to tell me

998
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
use this function to tell me
 

999
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,149
use this function to tell me

and ryan must
 

1043
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,909
and ryan must
visit tesco somehow the tesco is is here

1044
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:51,919
visit tesco somehow the tesco is is here
 

1045
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,070
visit tesco somehow the tesco is is here
today we just went to tesco yeah let's

1046
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
today we just went to tesco yeah let's
 

1047
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,110
today we just went to tesco yeah let's
go here

1048
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
go here
 

1049
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,990
go here
so now the same rule you must go to the

1050
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
so now the same rule you must go to the
 

1051
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,630
so now the same rule you must go to the
south and the east but you must go here

1052
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,640
south and the east but you must go here
 

1053
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,790
south and the east but you must go here
first and how many ways somewhere

1054
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:05,800

in three three
 

1059
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:26,149
in three three
how many ways from here and here

1060
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159

 

1061
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,750

you don't need to give me the exact

1062
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:27,760
you don't need to give me the exact
 

1063
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,149
you don't need to give me the exact
numbers but i want to know how you think

1064
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:30,159
numbers but i want to know how you think
 

1065
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,110
numbers but i want to know how you think
about it

1066
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,120
about it
 

1067
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,590
about it
how you calculate how what how do you

1068
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
how you calculate how what how do you
 

1069
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,029
how you calculate how what how do you
know it's six

1070
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:35,039
know it's six
 

1071
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,750
know it's six
i mean i guess you wanna guess so how

1072
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:37,760
i mean i guess you wanna guess so how
 

1073
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,669
i mean i guess you wanna guess so how
what do you do

1074
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679

 

1075
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,830

so in order for everything ryan to go

1076
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
so in order for everything ryan to go
 

1077
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,830
so in order for everything ryan to go
here

1078
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
here
 

1079
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,269
here
these can be divided into how many steps

1080
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,279

 

1081
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,870

how many ways of can you do it it takes

1082
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
how many ways of can you do it it takes
 

1083
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,549
how many ways of can you do it it takes
you think about it think

1084
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
you think about it think
 

1085
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,110
you think about it think
you think so i'll give you a thing how

1086
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
you think so i'll give you a thing how
 

1087
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,830
you think so i'll give you a thing how
many

1088
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840
many
 

1089
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,110
many
so you need to come from

1090
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
so you need to come from
 

1091
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,070
so you need to come from
the top left corner to to which place

1092
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,080
the top left corner to to which place
 

1093
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,110
the top left corner to to which place
first

1094
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,120
first
 

1095
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,190
first
how many ways let's go yes how many ways

1096
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
how many ways let's go yes how many ways
 

1097
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,789
how many ways let's go yes how many ways
of doing that

1098
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:14,799
of doing that
 

1099
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,070
of doing that
it takes you three steps f

1100
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
it takes you three steps f
 

1101
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,070
it takes you three steps f
and in order to come here to hear how

1102
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
and in order to come here to hear how
 

1103
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,590
and in order to come here to hear how
many steps f

1104
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
many steps f
 

1105
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,950
many steps f
no you don't you don't need to give me

1106
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:22,960
no you don't you don't need to give me
 

1107
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,430
no you don't you don't need to give me
the answer i just need to know how many

1108
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,440
the answer i just need to know how many
 

1109
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,630
the answer i just need to know how many
f3 two right

1110
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:28,640
f3 two right
 

1111
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,070
f3 two right
yes three columns three rows and two

1112
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,080
yes three columns three rows and two
 

1113
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,430
yes three columns three rows and two
columns all right

1114
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,440
columns all right
 

1115
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,630
columns all right
i have three two okay yes yeah so that's

1116
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
i have three two okay yes yeah so that's
 

1117
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,590
i have three two okay yes yeah so that's
how many you we can calculate that yeah

1118
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:39,600
how many you we can calculate that yeah
 

1119
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,789
how many you we can calculate that yeah
and how many ways

1120
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:40,799
and how many ways
 

1121
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,510
and how many ways
and then what's next how many ways of

1122
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:43,520
and then what's next how many ways of
 

1123
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,950
and then what's next how many ways of
calculating

1124
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:44,960
calculating
 

1125
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,510
calculating
from tesco to this place and how many

1126
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:47,520
from tesco to this place and how many
 

1127
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,510
from tesco to this place and how many
ways there

1128
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
ways there
 

1129
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,990
ways there
one two three and then i said one two

1130
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
one two three and then i said one two
 

1131
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,630
one two three and then i said one two
three four

1132
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:52,640
three four
 

1133
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,549
three four
five yeah so if the waste of tesco is

1134
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
five yeah so if the waste of tesco is
 

1135
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,390
five yeah so if the waste of tesco is
s35 okay so now this problem can be

1136
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
s35 okay so now this problem can be
 

1137
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,390
s35 okay so now this problem can be
divided into two

1138
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
divided into two
 

1139
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,430
divided into two
in order for you to go to this target

1140
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
in order for you to go to this target
 

1141
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,350
in order for you to go to this target
i need to go you need to go to the tesco

1142
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:07,360
i need to go you need to go to the tesco
 

1143
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,950
i need to go you need to go to the tesco
first and then go to from

1144
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960
first and then go to from
 

1145
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,630
first and then go to from
tesco go to this yeah your home okay

1146
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:12,640
tesco go to this yeah your home okay
 

1147
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,830
tesco go to this yeah your home okay
that's home

1148
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840

 

1149
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,830

okay so i have two numbers the number of

1150
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:17,840
okay so i have two numbers the number of
 

1151
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,470
okay so i have two numbers the number of
ways from these to this testicle

1152
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,480
ways from these to this testicle
 

1153
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,909
ways from these to this testicle
is s32 okay the number from tesco to

1154
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:23,919
is s32 okay the number from tesco to
 

1155
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,350
is s32 okay the number from tesco to
home is f35 so

1156
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,360
home is f35 so
 

1157
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,590
home is f35 so
what should i do how many ways from here

1158
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
what should i do how many ways from here
 

1159
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,269
what should i do how many ways from here
to here

1160
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:31,279
to here
 

1161
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,590
to here
what should i do with these two number

1162
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:33,600
what should i do with these two number
 

1163
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,389
what should i do with these two number
is should we

1168
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:46,840

 

1169
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,350

really

1170
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,360
really
 

1171
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,350
really
everybody any thoughts

1172
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:53,360

 

1173
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,310

there are there are eight ways to come

1174
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
there are there are eight ways to come
 

1175
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,029
there are there are eight ways to come
to tesco

1176
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:57,039
to tesco
 

1177
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,830
to tesco
and there are big ways to from to from

1178
00:27:59,830 --> 00:27:59,840
and there are big ways to from to from
 

1179
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,190
and there are big ways to from to from
tesco to home

1180
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
tesco to home
 

1181
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,710
tesco to home
so a b should i

1182
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,720
so a b should i
 

1183
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,750
so a b should i
edit or transit

1184
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:07,760
edit or transit
 

1185
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,750
edit or transit
add times add times

1186
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:11,760
add times add times
 

1187
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,950
add times add times
both i think it's probably

1188
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
both i think it's probably
 

1189
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,389
both i think it's probably
why is that time times

1190
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:18,399
why is that time times
 

1191
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,630
why is that time times
it's times if our of course is terms how

1192
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:22,640
it's times if our of course is terms how
 

1193
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,070
it's times if our of course is terms how
how how is that

1194
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
how how is that
 

1195
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,549
how how is that
nearly been half an hour okay so i why

1196
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
nearly been half an hour okay so i why
 

1197
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,350
nearly been half an hour okay so i why
is it terms

1198
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
is it terms
 

1199
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,070
is it terms
okay yes look if there are two ways of

1200
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,080
okay yes look if there are two ways of
 

1201
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,510
okay yes look if there are two ways of
coming there and then three ways are

1202
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:31,520
coming there and then three ways are
 

1203
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,789
coming there and then three ways are
coming next

1204
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:32,799
coming next
 

1205
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,630
coming next
so how many ways

1206
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640

 

1207
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,909

five why is five for each one

1208
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:39,919
five why is five for each one
 

1209
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,110
five why is five for each one
i can pick three one

1210
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,120
i can pick three one
 

1211
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,389
i can pick three one
two three and for this one i can pick

1212
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:46,399
two three and for this one i can pick
 

1213
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,430
two three and for this one i can pick
three one

1214
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
three one
 

1215
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,630
three one
two three you get it so it's two times

1216
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:50,640
two three you get it so it's two times
 

1217
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,029
two three you get it so it's two times
three it's not two and three got it

1218
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:53,039
three it's not two and three got it
 

1219
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,909
three it's not two and three got it
yeah yeah it's the multiple it's not

1220
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
yeah yeah it's the multiple it's not
 

1221
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,070
yeah yeah it's the multiple it's not
this is very important okay

1222
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,080
this is very important okay
 

1223
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,630
this is very important okay
got it why don't you get it there are

1224
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:00,640
got it why don't you get it there are
 

1225
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,830
got it why don't you get it there are
two ways coming here

1226
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:01,840
two ways coming here
 

1227
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,510
two ways coming here
unless we always going home how many

1228
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:03,520
unless we always going home how many
 

1229
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,110
unless we always going home how many
ways to do go home

1230
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,120
ways to do go home
 

1231
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,909
ways to do go home
five six six it's not five look one

if there are
 

1247
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,470
if there are
two and then four here how many ways

1248
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:28,480
two and then four here how many ways
 

1249
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,149
two and then four here how many ways
because there's six in the way

1250
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:30,159
because there's six in the way
 

1251
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,590
because there's six in the way
here yeah every right look

1252
