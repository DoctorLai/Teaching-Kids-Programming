00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,040

 

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,190

so what's the longest interval

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
so what's the longest interval
 

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,310
so what's the longest interval
we're given at least a list of

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
we're given at least a list of
 

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,870
we're given at least a list of
intervals we present with the start and

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
intervals we present with the start and
 

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,590
intervals we present with the start and
end

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
end
 

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,310
end
those are the integers okay start the

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
those are the integers okay start the
 

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,509
those are the integers okay start the
end for example like

14
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
end for example like
 

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,710
end for example like

1 3 1 3
 

17
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,069
1 3 1 3
this is a list of inner one three two

18
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
this is a list of inner one three two
 

19
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,950
this is a list of inner one three two
four three six maybe no no five

20
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
four three six maybe no no five
 

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,270
four three six maybe no no five
ten okay let's let's just do this three

22
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
ten okay let's let's just do this three
 

23
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,110
ten okay let's let's just do this three
intervals so if we

24
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
intervals so if we
 

25
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,190
intervals so if we
plot it in the line okay we plot it in

26
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
plot it in the line okay we plot it in
 

27
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,790
plot it in the line okay we plot it in
the line

28
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
the line
 

29
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,549
the line
this is yellow this is one this is two

30
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
this is yellow this is one this is two
 

31
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,830
this is yellow this is one this is two
this is three this is four this is five

32
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
this is three this is four this is five
 

33
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,869
this is three this is four this is five
and somewhere here is ten so one three

34
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
and somewhere here is ten so one three
 

35
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,950
and somewhere here is ten so one three
look once we start with the one

36
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
look once we start with the one
 

37
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,510
look once we start with the one
and the three is this one yeah i plotted

38
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
and the three is this one yeah i plotted
 

39
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,229
and the three is this one yeah i plotted
here

40
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
here
 

41
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,270
here
two and four is here two and four

42
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
two and four is here two and four
 

43
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,990
two and four is here two and four
you're just doing okay and then five and

44
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
you're just doing okay and then five and
 

45
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,390
you're just doing okay and then five and
ten

46
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
ten
 

47
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,670
ten
yeah okay so look when we combine the

48
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
yeah okay so look when we combine the
 

49
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,070
yeah okay so look when we combine the
intervals we have two parts these

50
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
intervals we have two parts these
 

51
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,870
intervals we have two parts these
one to four right and then five to ten

52
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
one to four right and then five to ten
 

53
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,429
one to four right and then five to ten
but this

54
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
but this
 

55
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,870
but this
the length here is five yeah the lens

56
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
the length here is five yeah the lens
 

57
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,630
the length here is five yeah the lens
here is three so you need to tell me

58
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
here is three so you need to tell me
 

59
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,830
here is three so you need to tell me
inside yes exactly so what if they're

60
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
inside yes exactly so what if they're
 

61
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,270
inside yes exactly so what if they're
both it doesn't matter because we return

62
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
both it doesn't matter because we return
 

63
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,749
both it doesn't matter because we return
the

64
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
the
 

65
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,749
the
longest length right

66
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759

 

67
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,910

then we turn one of it which is also the

68
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
then we turn one of it which is also the
 

69
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,670
then we turn one of it which is also the
same right

70
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
same right
 

71
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,429
same right
it's like this length is three this

72
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
it's like this length is three this
 

73
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,670
it's like this length is three this
distance is like

74
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
distance is like
 

75
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,749
distance is like
eight yeah right i don't know three and

76
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
eight yeah right i don't know three and
 

77
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,350
eight yeah right i don't know three and
then you you need to tell me that's the

78
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
then you you need to tell me that's the
 

79
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,749
then you you need to tell me that's the
three

80
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
three
 

81
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,109
three
is the maximum the longest

82
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
is the maximum the longest
 

83
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,030
is the maximum the longest
okay so if we these are the integer it

84
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
okay so if we these are the integer it
 

85
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,870
okay so if we these are the integer it
can be negative so how we

86
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
can be negative so how we
 

87
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,990
can be negative so how we
solving this problem if we if we want to

88
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
solving this problem if we if we want to
 

89
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,310
solving this problem if we if we want to
look

90
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
look
 

91
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,389
look
at these are not particularly in order

92
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
at these are not particularly in order
 

93
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,630
at these are not particularly in order
right the intervals are i'm giving you

94
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
right the intervals are i'm giving you
 

95
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,069
right the intervals are i'm giving you
it's not from the left to the right

96
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
it's not from the left to the right
 

97
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,670
it's not from the left to the right
and how about if we want to visit it

98
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
and how about if we want to visit it
 

99
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,429
and how about if we want to visit it
from the left to the right how can we do

100
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
from the left to the right how can we do
 

101
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,709
from the left to the right how can we do
this

102
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719
this
 

103
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,510
this
uh certain sorting yes so if the

104
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
uh certain sorting yes so if the
 

105
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,589
uh certain sorting yes so if the
interval given the interval so let's say

106
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
interval given the interval so let's say
 

107
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,190
interval given the interval so let's say
i went again interval

108
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200

 

109
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,750

again complexity okay

110
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760

 

111
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,030

so if we are sorting this and how are we

112
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
so if we are sorting this and how are we
 

113
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,670
so if we are sorting this and how are we
um solving this if we if this is the

114
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
um solving this if we if this is the
 

115
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,390
um solving this if we if this is the
same

116
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
same
 

117
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,110
same
uh how can we perform this one secondary

118
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
uh how can we perform this one secondary
 

119
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,869
uh how can we perform this one secondary
possibility

120
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
possibility
 

121
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,790
possibility
checking but not particularly in this

122
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
checking but not particularly in this
 

123
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,990
checking but not particularly in this
case how can we

124
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
case how can we
 

125
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,309
case how can we
oh anyway how can we do this

126
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
oh anyway how can we do this
 

127
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,710
oh anyway how can we do this
if we something something why why are we

128
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
if we something something why why are we
 

129
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,750
if we something something why why are we
sorting this uh

130
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
sorting this uh
 

131
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,070
sorting this uh
interval we want to visit in them in

132
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
interval we want to visit in them in
 

133
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,710
interval we want to visit in them in
from left to right order right

134
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
from left to right order right
 

135
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,070
from left to right order right
so if we visit the left right uh

136
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
so if we visit the left right uh
 

137
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,350
so if we visit the left right uh
how can we we can keep uh

138
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
how can we we can keep uh
 

139
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,830
how can we we can keep uh
what can we do with it look if this

140
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
what can we do with it look if this
 

141
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,710
what can we do with it look if this
current interval

142
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
current interval
 

143
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,390
current interval
we start from the second one the the

144
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
we start from the second one the the
 

145
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,390
we start from the second one the the
first one is interval

146
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
first one is interval
 

147
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,949
first one is interval
zero yeah we already know the star and n

148
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
zero yeah we already know the star and n
 

149
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:03,509
zero yeah we already know the star and n
here

150
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
here
 

151
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,630
here
right okay so even the next interval

152
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
right okay so even the next interval
 

153
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,710
right okay so even the next interval
what how many possibilities for the next

154
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
what how many possibilities for the next
 

155
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,910
what how many possibilities for the next
interval

156
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
interval
 

157
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,190
interval
it could be notes no no what i'm saying

158
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
it could be notes no no what i'm saying
 

159
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,949
it could be notes no no what i'm saying
is the positions

160
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
is the positions
 

161
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,190
is the positions
the style could be is bigger than the

162
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
the style could be is bigger than the
 

163
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,949
the style could be is bigger than the
star right so it could be

164
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
star right so it could be
 

165
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,149
star right so it could be
here this one it could be this way

166
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
here this one it could be this way
 

167
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,789
here this one it could be this way
or it could be this way right yeah all

168
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
or it could be this way right yeah all
 

169
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:25,509
or it could be this way right yeah all
right

170
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
right
 

171
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,789
right
there's three possibilities right

172
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
there's three possibilities right
 

173
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,710
there's three possibilities right
doesn't make sense no

174
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
doesn't make sense no
 

175
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,990
doesn't make sense no
not really this is a star and n and then

176
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
not really this is a star and n and then
 

177
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,750
not really this is a star and n and then
if we take in the next interval

178
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
if we take in the next interval
 

179
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,830
if we take in the next interval
it's on the right so it could be this

180
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
it's on the right so it could be this
 

181
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,670
it's on the right so it could be this
way this way or this way

182
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
way this way or this way
 

183
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,910
way this way or this way
but this is not connected to the

184
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
but this is not connected to the
 

185
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,270
but this is not connected to the
previous one right

186
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
previous one right
 

187
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,190
previous one right
yeah so for these two cases

188
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
yeah so for these two cases
 

189
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,589
yeah so for these two cases
for these two cases we don't change the

190
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
for these two cases we don't change the
 

191
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,470
for these two cases we don't change the
star right

192
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
star right
 

193
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,229
star right
because it will be connected to the next

194
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
because it will be connected to the next
 

195
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,670
because it will be connected to the next
interval right

196
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
interval right
 

197
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,070
interval right
yes but we we need to

198
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
yes but we we need to
 

199
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,270
yes but we we need to
we if if this is disjoint if the next

200
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
we if if this is disjoint if the next
 

201
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,789
we if if this is disjoint if the next
interval is not connected to the

202
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
interval is not connected to the
 

203
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,470
interval is not connected to the
previous one

204
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
previous one
 

205
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,630
previous one
so we need to change the start update

206
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
so we need to change the start update
 

207
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,750
so we need to change the start update
the start to this one

208
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
the start to this one
 

209
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,429
the start to this one
all right yeah and in all the cases

210
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
all right yeah and in all the cases
 

211
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,469
all right yeah and in all the cases
we need to update the n equals

212
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
we need to update the n equals
 

213
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,390
we need to update the n equals
the maximum of n current n and the new n

214
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
the maximum of n current n and the new n
 

215
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,590
the maximum of n current n and the new n
yeah and the new n right doesn't make

216
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
yeah and the new n right doesn't make
 

217
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,629
yeah and the new n right doesn't make
sense

218
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
sense
 

219
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,670
sense
yeah all right because the

220
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
yeah all right because the
 

221
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,870
yeah all right because the
end is uh if this this is the case look

222
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
end is uh if this this is the case look
 

223
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,070
end is uh if this this is the case look
if it is this case

224
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
if it is this case
 

225
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,150
if it is this case
the this new n is not bigger than the

226
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
the this new n is not bigger than the
 

227
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,710
the this new n is not bigger than the
old previous end so we don't update it

228
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
old previous end so we don't update it
 

229
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,870
old previous end so we don't update it
right but these two cases

230
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
right but these two cases
 

231
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,629
right but these two cases
are larger than the previous and am

232
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
are larger than the previous and am
 

233
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,030
are larger than the previous and am
right yeah

234
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
right yeah
 

235
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,870
right yeah
okay everything do you understand now

236
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880

 

237
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,830

do you understand which part you don't

238
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
do you understand which part you don't
 

239
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,600
do you understand which part you don't
understand

240
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:56,610

fine
 

247
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,350
fine
okay so can you tell me how can we solve

248
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
okay so can you tell me how can we solve
 

249
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,790
okay so can you tell me how can we solve
this problem

250
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
this problem
 

251
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,870
this problem
oh uh okay so uh okay so

252
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
oh uh okay so uh okay so
 

253
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,070
oh uh okay so uh okay so
these are all the possibilities

254
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
these are all the possibilities
 

255
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,110
these are all the possibilities
and there's a start and we end yeah

256
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
and there's a start and we end yeah
 

257
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,550
and there's a start and we end yeah
while we're keeping me started

258
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
while we're keeping me started
 

259
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,790
while we're keeping me started
and and if then they're disconnected

260
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
and and if then they're disconnected
 

261
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,510
and and if then they're disconnected
yeah we extend it and yeah and then when

262
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
yeah we extend it and yeah and then when
 

263
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,710
yeah we extend it and yeah and then when
we have this start and

264
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
we have this start and
 

265
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,830
we have this start and
we want to we can calculate the length

266
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
we want to we can calculate the length
 

267
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,749
we want to we can calculate the length
yeah i'm right i'm right eric focus

i'm right yeah you're right okay so can
 

271
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,189
i'm right yeah you're right okay so can
we write this problem

272
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
we write this problem
 

273
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,950
we write this problem
can we let it cool

274
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
can we let it cool
 

275
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,230
can we let it cool
um please focus okay focus everyone

okay if we're not giving any data
 

287
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,170
okay if we're not giving any data
what should we return

288
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,180
what should we return

interval okay
 

303
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,230

308
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
right yeah the first one okay all right
 

309
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,550
right yeah the first one okay all right
and then we start from the second one

310
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
and then we start from the second one
 

311
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,309
and then we start from the second one
yeah from let's say the

312
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
yeah from let's say the
 

313
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,469
yeah from let's say the
new star okay new star and then new n

314
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
new star okay new star and then new n
 

315
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,230
new star okay new star and then new n
right let's destroy it and in

here

322
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
here
 

323
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,550

if the new star that we want to check
 

333

00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
compared to that if
 

335
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,309
compared to that if
new star is bigger than the star what

336
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
new star is bigger than the star what
 

337
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,110
new star is bigger than the star what
should we do

338
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120

 

339
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,710

this is the star this is the end

340
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
this is the star this is the end
 

341
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:29,029
this is the star this is the end
wait wait this is the new star here

342
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039

 

343
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,430

just guessing okay new style okay

344
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
just guessing okay new style okay
 

345
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,029
just guessing okay new style okay
okay so that will be here and then end

346
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
okay so that will be here and then end
 

347
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,350
okay so that will be here and then end
and we want to update the end to the

348
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
and we want to update the end to the
 

349
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,309
and we want to update the end to the
maximum of

350
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
maximum of
 

351
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:51,110
maximum of
equals what max one or one and

352
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120

 

353
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,189

okay we have this answer yeah answer

354
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
okay we have this answer yeah answer
 

355
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,869
okay we have this answer yeah answer
will be equals to

356
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
will be equals to
 

357
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,110
will be equals to
at the beginning will be equals m plus

358
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
at the beginning will be equals m plus
 

359
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,790
at the beginning will be equals m plus
the first one m plus star

360
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
the first one m plus star
 

361
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,909
the first one m plus star
n minus star plus one right yeah m minus

362
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919
n minus star plus one right yeah m minus
 

363
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,110
n minus star plus one right yeah m minus
n

364
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
n
 

365
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,230
n
answer we we can we want to check if the

366
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
answer we we can we want to check if the
 

367
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,990
answer we we can we want to check if the
current time n is the max

368
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
current time n is the max
 

369
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,070
current time n is the max
is longer than the answer so how what

370
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
is longer than the answer so how what
 

371
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,589
is longer than the answer so how what
can we do here um

372
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
can we do here um
 

373
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,710
can we do here um
the next eagle max maxwell

374
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720

yeah it's always again because this part

390
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
yeah it's always again because this part
 

391
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,509
yeah it's always again because this part
is what this part is one or one

00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
is what this part is one or one
 

393
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,110
is what this part is one or one
oh and which is bigger oh and logan okay

394
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
oh and which is bigger oh and logan okay
 

395
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,750
oh and which is bigger oh and logan okay
what's the

396
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
what's the
 

397
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,590
what's the
space complexity

398
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600

 

399
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,910

what's the space complexity

400
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920

 

401
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,310

and where are we using data

402
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
and where are we using data
 

403
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,949
and where are we using data
data data is given if we don't consider

404
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
data data is given if we don't consider
 

405
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,870
data data is given if we don't consider
that as the additional space

406
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
that as the additional space
 

407
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,829
that as the additional space
so what's the time what's the space

408
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839
so what's the time what's the space
 

409
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,030
so what's the time what's the space
complexity

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,389

what i just said a one yeah okay

412
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
what i just said a one yeah okay
 

413
00:09:42,399 --> 00:10:00,150
what i just said a one yeah okay
i said i won okay okay

414
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160

 

415
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,630

hello hello

416
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
hello hello
 

417
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,750
hello hello
boogie if that's

418
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
boogie if that's
 

419
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,030
boogie if that's
if that look this is star this is n

420
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
if that look this is star this is n
 

421
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,910
if that look this is star this is n
and then if the new star is bigger than

422
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
and then if the new star is bigger than
 

423
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,230
and then if the new star is bigger than
n

424
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
n
 

425
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:30,949
n
right so what if start

426
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959

 

427
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,710

and yeah you end and

428
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
and yeah you end and
 

429
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,630
and yeah you end and
new star cannot be bigger than you and

430
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
new star cannot be bigger than you and
 

431
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,330
new star cannot be bigger than you and
come on right
