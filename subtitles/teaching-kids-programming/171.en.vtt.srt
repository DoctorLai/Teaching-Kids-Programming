3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,390

interesting okay maybe we can come back

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
interesting okay maybe we can come back
 

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,670
interesting okay maybe we can come back
to that later

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,680
to that later
 

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,790
to that later
today we talk about two sum who is the

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
today we talk about two sum who is the
 

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,150
today we talk about two sum who is the
investment that's happening we talk

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
investment that's happening we talk
 

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,830
investment that's happening we talk
about threesome less than that but

12
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
about threesome less than that but
 

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,750
about threesome less than that but
it's slightly different we want to find

14
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760
it's slightly different we want to find
 

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,589
it's slightly different we want to find
out the largest to some

16
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
out the largest to some
 

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,350
out the largest to some
less less than a time for example like

18
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
less less than a time for example like
 

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,870
less less than a time for example like
doesn't have to be two some

20
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
doesn't have to be two some
 

21
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,950
doesn't have to be two some
one two three so the target is four

22
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
one two three so the target is four
 

23
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,229
one two three so the target is four
you get to school so can you find two

24
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
you get to school so can you find two
 

25
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,030
you get to school so can you find two
numbers

26
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
numbers
 

27
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,510
numbers
in the list which added together less

28
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
in the list which added together less
 

29
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,830
in the list which added together less
than four but i want to find the maximum

30
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
than four but i want to find the maximum
 

31
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,830
than four but i want to find the maximum
the largest one exactly four no

32
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
the largest one exactly four no
 

33
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,470
the largest one exactly four no
one two yeah one two yeah one two eight

34
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
one two yeah one two yeah one two eight
 

35
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,590
one two yeah one two yeah one two eight
if you didn't my question

36
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
if you didn't my question
 

37
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,990
if you didn't my question
look if i put a zero here

38
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000

 

39
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,149

yeah zero here or zero three zero two

40
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
yeah zero here or zero three zero two
 

41
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,670
yeah zero here or zero three zero two
zero one that's all

42
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
zero one that's all
 

43
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,149
zero one that's all
less than four but i wanted the largest

44
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
less than four but i wanted the largest
 

45
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,429
less than four but i wanted the largest
sum that's less than four

46
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
sum that's less than four
 

47
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,469
sum that's less than four
so equals three yeah

48
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
so equals three yeah
 

49
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,109
so equals three yeah
zero one so any two numbers pick two

50
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
zero one so any two numbers pick two
 

51
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,149
zero one so any two numbers pick two
numbers

52
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
numbers
 

53
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,230
numbers
let's add it less than the these but i

54
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
let's add it less than the these but i
 

55
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,830
let's add it less than the these but i
want to find the largest one right

56
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
want to find the largest one right
 

57
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,510
want to find the largest one right
it could be three it could be two but i

58
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
it could be three it could be two but i
 

59
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:42,389
it could be three it could be two but i
want to find the largest one

60
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:42,399

 

61
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,870

what can we do we want to find the two

62
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
what can we do we want to find the two
 

63
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,510
what can we do we want to find the two
numbers

64
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
numbers
 

65
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,870
numbers
that added less than the sum less than

66
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
that added less than the sum less than
 

67
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,550
that added less than the sum less than
the target but i want to find out the

68
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
the target but i want to find out the
 

69
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,230
the target but i want to find out the
maximum the largest sum

70
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
maximum the largest sum
 

71
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,389
maximum the largest sum
that's less than the target so if you're

72
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
that's less than the target so if you're
 

73
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,510
that's less than the target so if you're
not sure what to do

74
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
not sure what to do
 

75
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,630
not sure what to do
say three thousand

76
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
say three thousand
 

77
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,389
say three thousand
yeah how can we prove what improvements

78
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
yeah how can we prove what improvements
 

79
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,149
yeah how can we prove what improvements
is the first idea coming to your mind so

80
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
is the first idea coming to your mind so
 

81
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,630
is the first idea coming to your mind so
what how can we prove us

82
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
what how can we prove us
 

83
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,590
what how can we prove us
we own the two numbers huh so what's the

84
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
we own the two numbers huh so what's the
 

85
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,830
we own the two numbers huh so what's the
term condensable if we prove us

86
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
term condensable if we prove us
 

87
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,869
term condensable if we prove us
all the two numbers pairs

88
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
all the two numbers pairs
 

89
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,830
all the two numbers pairs
ln squared oh n squared okay one square

90
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
ln squared oh n squared okay one square
 

91
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,510
ln squared oh n squared okay one square
so the time complexity will be always

92
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
so the time complexity will be always
 

93
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,110
so the time complexity will be always
good we just prove something and we

94
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
good we just prove something and we
 

95
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,150
good we just prove something and we
check if the sum

96
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
check if the sum
 

97
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,390
check if the sum
is less than target if it is we will

98
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
is less than target if it is we will
 

99
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,830
is less than target if it is we will
call the maximum right

100
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
call the maximum right
 

101
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,150
call the maximum right
yeah yeah okay can we can we just do

102
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
yeah yeah okay can we can we just do
 

103
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,869
yeah yeah okay can we can we just do
this just

104
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
this just
 

105
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,589
this just
just to give you an idea okay define

106
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
just to give you an idea okay define
 

107
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,910
just to give you an idea okay define
later you're going to say

108
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
later you're going to say
 

109
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,620
later you're going to say
can we do better less than

110
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:36,630
can we do better less than
 

111
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:46,390
can we do better less than

113
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,190

let's say answer let's let's make it a

let's say answer let's let's make it a
 

115
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,949
let's say answer let's let's make it a

isf we want to prove

122
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
isf we want to prove
 

123
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,830
isf we want to prove
it how can

for the second number j in range
so can you tell me what what should i

128
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
so can you tell me what what should i
 

129
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,750
so can you tell me what what should i
put here

130
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760

 

131
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,390

the proof was in two numbers the first

132
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
the proof was in two numbers the first
 

133
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,350
the proof was in two numbers the first
number is

134
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
number is
 

135
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,789
number is
index i the second number index one j

136
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
index i the second number index one j
 

137
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,949
index i the second number index one j
j j star is what

138
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
j j star is what
 

139
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,630
j j star is what
you can start with i plus one als right

140
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
you can start with i plus one als right
 

141
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,630
you can start with i plus one als right
i plus one to n right or you can do this

142
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
i plus one to n right or you can do this
 

143
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,910
i plus one to n right or you can do this
you can start with t i yeah it also

144
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
you can start with t i yeah it also
 

145
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,350
you can start with t i yeah it also
works yeah

146
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
works yeah
 

147
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,470
works yeah
all right this means that i look at it

148
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
all right this means that i look at it
 

149
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,630
all right this means that i look at it
i j or o

which one is this can you tell me which

154
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
which one is this can you tell me which
 

155
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,710
which one is this can you tell me which
one is this i j ijlj1 the pairs

156
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
one is this i j ijlj1 the pairs
 

157
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:08,070
one is this i j ijlj1 the pairs
the index

158
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080

 

159
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,030

which one is it so can you tell me i if

160
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
which one is it so can you tell me i if
 

161
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,990
which one is it so can you tell me i if
i i make sure the first index is i and

162
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
i i make sure the first index is i and
 

163
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,200
i i make sure the first index is i and
then

164
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,210
