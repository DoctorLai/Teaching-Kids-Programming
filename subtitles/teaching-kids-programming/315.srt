1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,480
hello hello how are you today good okay

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,240
okay

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,120
i'm here so today we're going to talk

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,400
about

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,559
this

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,559
okay

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,200
so fluffy icon is a very popular well

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,200
known accurate in computer

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,560
[Music]

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,440
thing so

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,520
image pics uh you know we have an image

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,600
a picture and now we have some obstacles

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,920
here some obstacles

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,239
i don't know it's there yeah

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,440
now okay so dark

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,039
it's not dark it's maybe uh i don't know

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,760
okay so now if i drop uh

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,680
if i want to start flat filling the

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:01:00,079
image at this position okay

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,000
and then only fluffy we put a little bit

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,680
from the inside

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,519
so what what does it look like for

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,920
example you have a container with

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,600
something it looks like a blob with a

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,240
brush

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,560
so if you have a uh uh

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,560
looks like an island a bucket of you

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,880
know if you're starting the pouring

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,720
pouring pouring the ink glue at this

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,560
point you know the water the ink yeah

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,640
the ink

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,640
you start to put pull it in pour

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,320
so the image

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,560
will be finally like outside will be

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,720
blue yeah you'll be stuck this is the

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,479
final stage it's off off here outside

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,040
but not normally inside because the wind

38
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,720
cannot go inside the ink will stop okay

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,799
when we fly feeling

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,280
the flows will stop at the boundary and

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,680
the obstacles right all right

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,680
okay so

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,280
another and

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,520
another example is if we start to

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,119
fulfill the inside if we put a dot you

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,560
know if we start to pull it at the

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,439
center what was going to be like

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,439
and the inside will be all green yeah

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,439
yeah

50
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,160
so

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,959
let's let's use a very simple example

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,879
with the magic your matrix numbers yeah

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,840
numbers with two dimensional metrics

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,720
tournament let's say one one one two

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
three four four two

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,840
uh

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,879
one one two

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,879
two

59
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,640
one zero zero

60
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,239
one

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,720
okay so if i

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,319
if we are going to start fulfilling and

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,440
hit this position

64
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,920
with uh with the color the new color

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,280
will be equal to let's say

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,319
four okay so what does let's maybe

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
two

68
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,440
three what do you think it would be like

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,720
we can change all the twos to freeze

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,760
okay

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,760
okay let's hold on

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,239
we don't do the one stop all the way

73
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,760
yeah okay

74
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,000
so which which two you think you're

75
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,560
going to be changed with me

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,760
this this this this yeah okay so we

77
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,280
change it to

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,080
exactly yes

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,400
yeah

80
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,800
so the the problem because very simple

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,879
so we are starting to fully uh filming

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,480
the image with the partition with the

83
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,239
partition with the

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,640
with the color with the background with

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,760
a new color okay with the new color new

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,120
color

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,319
new color

88
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,280
so

89
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,280
new colors so we can change we can

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,440
change the pixel to the new color as

91
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,120
long as it's next to each other the

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,120
neighbor you know four direction the

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,400
neighbor yeah this is the neighbor this

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,920
is the neighbor this is the neighbor

95
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,480
yeah

96
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,680
to four neighbors as long as the inside

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,599
of the image

98
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,680
it's next to the name is the neighbor

99
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,760
and its color is the same as the

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,439
starting color right which is we need to

101
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,080
remember the starting color which is two

102
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,640
right as long as it is two then we can

103
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,560
keep doing this yeah and here no more

104
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,159
right until the pixel go out of the

105
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,239
image or it stops

106
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,680
after the other pixel right because we

107
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,840
don't change this one right we don't

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,680
change it because it's strong

109
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
no no that's a good question you cannot

110
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,959
leave neighbor only

111
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,959
horizontal or vertical right you

112
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,899
[Music]

113
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,320
the bottom one could go with the one

114
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,600
thing

115
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,040
which one which one are you talking

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,880
about

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,759
which one are you talking about

118
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,560
this one this could go to this

119
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,160
yeah

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
through the emitter

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,120
so you first thought of vertigo in the

122
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,759
horizon okay

123
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,240
what's your uh approach i mean any idea

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,360
if we're starting from a position i know

125
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,880
we follow it yeah

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,160
search level by level and also

127
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,400
yeah because these two sometimes can be

128
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,080
you know if one can can can be used to

129
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,240
solve the problem the other is also

130
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,720
going to be so conservative right these

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
two years are just different in the way

132
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,400
they

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,960
you know they do research right yeah

134
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,639
so let's do this uh

135
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,639
let's do the test search first okay

136
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,320
okay okay come on

137
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,360
define

138
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,840
let's say fluffier

139
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,080
we have an image yeah image

140
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,360
and we have a star partition starting

141
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,759
rows

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,919
uh styling column and then we want to

143
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,039
fill a new card new with the new color

144
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,280
right

145
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,560
yeah with the new color okay sorry about

146
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,759
that

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
and

148
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,680
okay so

149
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,720
so

150
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,080
what

151
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
how how do we do the process uh

152
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,919
we

153
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,080
search

154
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,280
research how to research

155
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,440
in a deficit order so what kind of

156
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,440
implementation usually we use with

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,120
okay so first of all we

158
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,800
i see the rows and the columns yeah the

159
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,800
rows will be length of image

160
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,680
and then column will be length of image

161
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,680
zero

162
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,080
okay so one question look if i start to

163
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,000
feel this that look i'm at this position

164
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,840
and i want to

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,680
recursively call this

166
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,360
and what happened how does it how do you

167
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,960
how do we prevent it going back to

168
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,479
filling the pictures we already feel

169
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,520
right that's one problem we need to

170
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,240
solve right

171
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,440
how do we look

172
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,680
yeah do you understand what i'm talking

173
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,680
about

174
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,160
okay so look i'm starting to feel this

175
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,600
with the pigs

176
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,160
three

177
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,280
three three three yeah so look i put it

178
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,639
in the three and then we call here

179
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,599
yeah

180
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,160
three

181
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,039
yeah and then see

182
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,800
okay so one way of one way because we

183
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,479
already changed this pixel to three so

184
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,919
it can't go back right when you go back

185
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,280
it's not a color one we're looking for

186
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,000
the color ones to

187
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,319
to to work yeah basically we're working

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,479
at the color pixel one and then when we

189
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,319
feel we we start to fill it with the

190
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,319
color three then you can't go back right

191
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,880
and how about this case look

192
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,960
what it means

193
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,240
okay so yeah that's a good question look

194
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,319
how look

195
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,240
usually recursion every question how do

196
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,560
you prevent it going back

197
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,039
so if i go to the if i if i'm in this

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,479
position ryan please keep quiet

199
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,319
if i'm in this partition if i go to this

200
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,199
does it hold does it go back

201
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,199
no no right how why is it not back over

202
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,960
because we we already changed this

203
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:50,780
picture to two what if it's just like

204
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,400
wait what if it's what if it's like

205
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,720
[Music]

206
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,720
this

207
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,800
like that what do you mean like that

208
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
on the chain

209
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,400
if if and here we want to change the

210
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,000
picture to one then that's going to be a

211
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,879
problem right because it's already in

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,360
one

213
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,120
right if you go here you already change

214
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,680
it this is one and you change it to one

215
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,240
and how about this pixel you think it's

216
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,319
a new pixel but it's not right yeah

217
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,879
so how can we fix this how can we

218
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,560
remember things using computer data

219
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,919
structure what kind of thing can we use

220
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,240
to remember

221
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,240
the thing

222
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,160
okay

223
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,519
okay so we have a different search

224
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,200
differences

225
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,680
and we are currently r c and we want to

226
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,919
just yeah we want to start filling with

227
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,959
the transition rc

228
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,360
right

229
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,360
and then

230
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,959
we first of all we need to have a scene

231
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,000
yeah scene equals

232
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,839
the hashtag yes set

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,360
right if

234
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,839
r c

235
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,839
in scene it's always seen if we already

236
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,680
visited this pizza before then we just

237
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,720
return yeah we simply return right i'm

238
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,200
right

239
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,160
yeah and then now if you know if this

240
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,200
pixel is not visited so what's the first

241
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,680
thing we need to do

242
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,920
we need to do what look rc we are

243
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,279
currently a position as if it's in the

244
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,959
notebook

245
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,480
if we have seen this before if we ever

246
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,480
think it would return

247
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,000
if not if we haven't seen it so what

248
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,240
should we do

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,640
what should we do

250
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,839
we add it add it to the notebook right

251
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,080
easy that

252
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,880
scene.area and rc okay look we we use

253
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,680
this

254
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,240
look

255
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,640
rc this is a tuber yeah tuber meaning

256
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,519
that we're remembering this position in

257
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,720
uh

258
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,360
in the notebook

259
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,959
and now now this picture is

260
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
it's not be immediately so what should

261
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,680
we do we should change the picture to

262
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,880
the new color right so new so the image

263
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,040
okay

264
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,320
image

265
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,279
uh

266
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,240
r

267
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,240
c will be to new color right new color

268
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,279
okay so now i have filled this picture

269
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,279
so i want to try the neighbor right we

270
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,480
want to try four neighbors right

271
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,399
yeah

272
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,160
so we can try

273
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:24,079
first of all we can try r minus one c

274
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,560
or r plus one c or r c minus one or c r

275
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,519
c plus one yeah this four position right

276
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,560
look this is rc what's this

277
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,279
ah

278
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,360
plus one c uh what's this

279
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,200
r minus one c what's this

280
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,240
ah

281
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,040
r what

282
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,279
r

283
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,120
c minus one

284
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,399
r c plus one

285
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,720
so look this is the oh we can do this in

286
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,600
four for all we can do is for

287
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,079
we can do a loop here dr dc is the

288
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,959
offset of the rows and columns in four

289
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,959
direction so you fold that right

290
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,800
so zero one

291
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,440
one zero

292
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,600
zero minus one

293
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,360
minus one zero yeah this is the four

294
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,480
fold this is the

295
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,600
the offset in on the offset

296
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,800
yeah offset so now the new r

297
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,160
nu r will be r plus p i

298
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,760
nu c will be c plus dc and then first of

299
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,600
all we need to check if this is inside

300
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,519
the image right so we need to check this

301
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,480
even inside if

302
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,120
zero smaller bigger than nr

303
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,560
smaller than r

304
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,399
and

305
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,279
n1 you can guess

306
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,000
zero

307
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,079
smaller or equal than nc

308
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,399
smaller than c if this is inside the

309
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,160
image right and then we do the

310
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,240
search recursively release n r and c y

311
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
all right

312
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,680
yeah

313
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,160
yeah checking if this new

314
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,320
neighbor is still inside the image then

315
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,279
we do this at night and see right am i

316
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,959
right

317
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,880
yes

318
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,639
and we just do the needs to call this

319
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,670
dms

320
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,079
dfs

321
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,800
[Music]

322
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,320
srs here

323
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,320
and then we can return the image

324
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,519
okay present the image

325
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,399
so

326
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,920
the most important thing is this one

327
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,120
right because we have to check we have

328
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,760
to

329
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,600
mark the visited pixels otherwise there

330
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,760
will be sometimes there will be infinity

331
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,880
roof especially if that

332
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,639
is what

333
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,639
uh

334
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,079
especially what okay okay there's one

335
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,959
thing missing okay that's one thing you

336
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,279
think

337
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,519
because we only want to mark the pixel

338
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,880
which is the same as the original color

339
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,839
so here

340
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,000
uh

341
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,120
so i have to put the color

342
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,639
color will be equals image

343
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,040
sisc right this is the

344
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,360
the pixel we are going to mark right so

345
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,600
we have to check uh

346
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,320
we have to check here right we have to

347
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,320
check somewhere

348
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,680
we have to check somewhere if here if

349
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,639
the new and

350
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,480
and

351
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,200
if the image

352
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
nr and c

353
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,120
equals the color right because we only

354
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,519
want to mark the

355
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,360
the pixel which the value equals to

356
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,399
color which is the star okay that's the

357
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,680
part that's missing okay am i right

358
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,440
yeah

359
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,040
otherwise you otherwise if you don't

360
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,279
have this what will happen you're

361
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,240
feeling every pixel right because it you

362
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,360
would just

363
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,079
go to

364
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,160
four directions without any check and

365
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,240
eventually this pixel will be only one

366
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,639
color which is new color so that's very

367
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,040
important because we only want to

368
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,920
expand we don't we only want to go to

369
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,560
the next neighbor to the neighbor only

370
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,360
if this neighbor has the color with the

371
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,839
same which is the original color right

372
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,519
all right all right that makes sense

373
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,519
and then you know it's definite search

374
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,519
one one problem of definite search is

375
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,240
these the calling depth you know because

376
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,320
look if if this is a very big picture

377
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,880
right a very big picture

378
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,440
and if there's no obstacles if there's

379
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,839
no obstacles it's just a blank picture

380
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,199
if i start feeling the

381
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,120
black color from from one corner right

382
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,720
yeah and then these were calling the

383
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,160
recursion recursion because this is

384
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,480
we're always

385
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,079
uh this is always true and then we're

386
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,360
calling location location equation

387
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,600
indication

388
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,199
and the depth the calling step the

389
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,199
callings as

390
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,199
uh recursion depths will be too much

391
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,480
will be bigger than the

392
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,639
uh you know

393
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,720
because the stack is six size right in

394
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,320
the computer there's a course call step

395
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,399
calling stack

396
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,279
calling stack it's a it's a fixed size

397
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,360
stack

398
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,360
it's a fixed size step okay i'm going to

399
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,760
talk about a little bit about the

400
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,279
corning stack so computer is like a

401
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,920
stack right it's a it's growing

402
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,399
downwards yeah a stack calling step so

403
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,240
every time you call a function right

404
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
i will come here you call the function

405
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,639
according that will happen is the

406
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,480
computer will remember push the address

407
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,240
you know push your address of the

408
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,600
current address yeah

409
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,399
kind of address

410
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,480
the location yeah location and i also

411
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,880
will push the parameters

412
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,519
here and we'll push the

413
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,680
uh you know the the local variable

414
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,639
storage of the function right somewhere

415
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,880
here

416
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
right and if you could keep calling

417
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,160
calling calling then you'll start

418
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,720
feeling this calling stack

419
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,040
and then once it reaches the maximum

420
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,279
size of the stack what happened boom the

421
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,759
computer just will complain that

422
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,000
stack overflow okay

423
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,519
make sense so stack is a fixed size in

424
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,720
computer because the computer has the

425
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,720
limited memory yeah memory is like a

426
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,759
brand you remember things in computer

427
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,480
right

428
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,560
the computer you remember the things in

429
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,759
ram what's that

430
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,759
random access memory it's like it's a

431
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,839
you know it's a memory thing so computer

432
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,519
can store the data information in the

433
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,600
ram and have a stack right call this

434
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,360
thing so one way to solve this problem

435
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,199
is we can use the

436
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,920
breakfast search we can we can do this

437
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,079
in iteratively yeah using a iterative

438
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,600
one and we can do this using breakfast

439
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,000
and we can even

440
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,360
implement the different search using uh

441
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,079
iterative yeah literally already

442
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,079
so let's do this

443
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,240
make sense every friend you've been

444
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,680
quiet today

445
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,040
okay

446
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,199
yeah

447
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,959
are you still with me yes

448
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,959
okay

449
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:45,759
so now again r c the same r will be the

450
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,279
number of rows which is length of image

451
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,639
right because the image is a two

452
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,120
dimensional ray and c will be length of

453
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,720
image 0 right because we think it's a

454
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,000
two dimensional array

455
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,759
okay

456
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,480
there's a pixel here if the length if

457
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,079
the image is only i mean if the image is

458
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,559
zero that's not

459
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,319
it is empty then this clock

460
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,240
i mean

461
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,640
this will report errors yeah but we

462
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,439
assert we're assuming the image is the

463
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,760
non-empty it's not empty it has at least

464
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,600
one row and one column okay

465
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,199
and the color this is the starting color

466
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,120
we want to follow we want to follow the

467
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,720
pixel with the color color equals image

468
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,120
image s-i-c-l okay

469
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,720
so in order to implement professors what

470
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,120
kind of data structure okay what kind of

471
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,440
data structure are we using to kill yeah

472
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,919
i mean python we're using the dq double

473
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,360
and the key well okay q equals pq

474
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,720
at the beginning

475
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,360
is the and the partition is srsc right

476
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,799
this is the partition

477
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,640
okay

478
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,640
and now we also need a hash table

479
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,559
notebook to remember the points we have

480
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,679
the pixel we have we've seen so we have

481
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,679
a cn equals one

482
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,869
[Music]

483
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,360
notebook what's number called c

484
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,440
set has said okay

485
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,039
what is that

486
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,840
so now y

487
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,360
q

488
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,559
okay y q

489
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,799
the

490
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:24,559
r c will be

491
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:27,840
how do you get the element from the q

492
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,559
how to get the element from q q to y

493
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,960
forward problem yeah

494
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,799
if you want only this is a kill

495
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,280
pop left you're taking one hour from the

496
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,200
left if you just pop what happened

497
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,520
it'll go for right yeah it will go for

498
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,520
all right

499
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,400
now we have this color we have this

500
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,080
color i know we want to mark it right we

501
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,160
want to mark it

502
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,559
we want to mark it with with the image

503
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,360
so image

504
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,640
rc equals new color right in new color

505
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,960
we want to change this color right

506
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,600
i know we need to

507
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,480
we need to do what if check if this is

508
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,640
already visited if rc in

509
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,960
scene we just continue right what's

510
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,880
continue mean

511
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,880
yes continue so continue just just skip

512
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,120
the rest of the loop and goes to the

513
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,000
next okay

514
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,400
and okay so that's the same what's next

515
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,200
if it's not enough no if it's not been

516
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,120
seen so what should have been the first

517
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,880
thing to do

518
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,080
if we're not if you haven't seen this

519
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,240
before what's the first thing

520
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,240
to do

521
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,760
okay so look at this is quite similar in

522
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,360
the differences yeah

523
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,440
except that we are using the q right and

524
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,120
then what should we do now

525
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,640
uh then we need to go through for the

526
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,480
next four four direction fdr dc

527
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,640
in okay look

528
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,080
again the same right okay

529
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,520
zero one

530
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,280
one zero

531
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,320
minus one

532
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:20,080
zero zero minus one

533
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,360
and then n r and c will be equals r plus

534
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,840
dr

535
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,520
c plus dc and now we need to check if

536
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,400
these two are in the ring right zero

537
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,120
smaller than nr smaller than r

538
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,520
and

539
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,360
zero smaller than equal and nc smaller

540
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,120
than c also

541
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,679
we need to check if this is the new

542
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,679
image yeah image

543
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,120
and uh okay i'm going to write here and

544
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,440
and what and we're going to check the

545
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,440
next piece the neighbor picture if it's

546
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,880
the same color

547
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,840
the color yeah

548
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,000
yeah we only feel the color

549
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,640
even we only feel the neighbor if it has

550
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,919
the same color as color right right

551
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,679
so n

552
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,720
image

553
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:05,840
and our new color nc equal equals

554
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,000
in this way then we do this q dot how do

555
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,480
we push it to the queue

556
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,480
q dot

557
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,280
q how do we put the element to the queue

558
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,760
a pen yeah look we take one element from

559
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,320
the queue and we we want to expand its

560
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,960
next kids neighbors into the keyword

561
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,240
which is an r and c

562
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,559
okay

563
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,840
and and that will be return image with

564
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,840
an image return image

565
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,080
okay so in this way we're doing this

566
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,400
iteratively without a calling stack so

567
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,320
it won't be you only you won't have this

568
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,520
code problem or stack overflow okay you

569
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,840
won't have this programmer stack

570
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,159
overflow

571
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,200
um

572
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,520
so as i said we are using the q here and

573
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,400
but we again we can use the stack right

574
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,240
we can use the stack

575
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,960
we can use the stack

576
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,280
so we can change this dq to us to a list

577
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,520
just to emulate a stack right

578
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,480
it also work right right you also want

579
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,400
it just but when you uh plot it

580
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,640
when you it's just the different orders

581
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,559
of plotting uh fulfilling the pixels

582
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,159
right with the q and step because the

583
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,720
way to

584
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,640
uh you know if push a few elements just

585
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,919
stack and then you only push the same

586
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,080
elements to kill the way to take it out

587
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,400
the dq or this step

588
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,320
the order of the sequence is different

589
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,480
but eventually all the pixel required

590
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,760
pixel are fulfilled right it's just

591
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,280
different order of of feeding uh pixels

592
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,400
make sense

593
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,440
anyway

594
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,400
make sense

595
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,280
okay so i'm going to write a image and

596
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,679
then you change it to the

597
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,159
to the final okay

598
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,320
let's say one one two so you're gonna

599
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,520
give it an input and we need to say the

600
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,520
output yeah that's it

601
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,400
it needs to be square doesn't it

602
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,400
no

603
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,960
can be rectangles

604
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,960
or triangles

605
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,559
okay so i'm starting at this position

606
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,400
four and i want to change it to color

607
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,200
five

608
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,159
okay

609
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,159
five five five five five five

610
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,540
[Music]

611
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,440
okay so one more question what's the

612
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,279
what's the data structure i will use how

613
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,400
do we prevent the picture

614
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,640
hotline

615
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,440
now how do we prevent the picture being

616
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:04,320
visited again

617
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,320
what is the coding in computers set

618
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,480
it only contains the unique elements

619
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,480
okay that's it for today good job

620
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,480
bye-bye
