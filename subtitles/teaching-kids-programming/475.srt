1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
hello mr mr rhino are you right yeah

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,279
okay so let's look at this problem

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,080
partition an array into pairs and the

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,120
sum of each pair needs to be divisible

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,839
by k so we have this array all positive

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,119
numbers a k is also a positive number so

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,760
four two a one so we want to partition

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,840
the pair a pair is two numbers yeah can

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,080
we position this array into pairs so

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,279
that each pair the sum of each pair is

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,279
divisible by three anybody

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,760
so for example like four two a one four

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,520
plus two

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:46,719
divided by k is zero okay three and a

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,719
plus one divided by k equal equal

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,559
we also four plus a or two plus one is

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,600
both okay okay if two numbers a and b

18
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,000
need

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,199
the sum of a and b needs to be divided

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,760
by k

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,280
yeah we write it as modulus equal equals

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,760
zero it also means that a plus b is the

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,560
multiple of k yeah it's k times

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,600
something yeah k times something okay

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,799
so that's the that's how we check if the

26
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,280
sum can be divided by k okay so in

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,680
mathematics we have these three

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,479
lines two lines equal three line is

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,439
called

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,119
congruence more dura

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,840
okay so

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:34,400
a congruence is congruent to b modulus n

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,840
okay so let's take an example

34
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,840
24 is congruent to 36

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,520
mode 2f what does it mean it means that

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,439
24 divided by 2f remaining 0.

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,240
36 divided by 2f remaining 0 is the same

38
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,040
thing

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,799
a

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
congruent

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,560
10

42
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,600
more euros two right

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,240
because they both even numbers a divided

44
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,399
by two remains zero ten divided by two

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,600
remains zero

46
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,640
if however model three divided by three

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,000
modulus remain two eleven

48
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,239
divided by three remain two okay so that

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,879
that's what the congruence module is

50
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,599
okay so coming back to this question we

51
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,959
want to look for a plus b modulus k

52
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,840
equal to zero

53
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,120
so we can rewrite this as a plus a

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,080
modulus k

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
plus b modulus k

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,200
modulus k

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,480
equals k minus k okay now we can rewrite

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,000
this into

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,519
a modulus k

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,040
equals k minus b modulus k

61
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,480
okay so look

62
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,360
a and k minus b is a pair okay so for

63
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,680
example if this number is if this number

64
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,840
is 4 4 modulus 3 equals 1 right so it

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,959
has remained 1 so look

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,920
4 it has remained 1

67
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:06,000
so the other number for example a not 1

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,280
2 3 four five six seven eight okay it

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
has two actual right two extra what does

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,319
it mean a modulus k

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,200
a modulus three remain two it has two

72
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,080
extra yes so actually so this group has

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,480
two actual this group has one extra so

74
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,799
we have one more here and we have two

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,920
more here so put it together one plus

76
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,159
two is a multiple of k right so

77
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,560
so coming back to this question so we

78
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,080
can use the dictionary hash map

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,480
to store

80
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,280
to store one if the number is i we can

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,959
store the k i modulus okay to store the

82
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,480
remaining phase

83
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,760
right we can partition arrays only if we

84
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,159
have

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,280
we have a pairs in each remainder for

86
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,879
example like for the remainder one

87
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,480
for the remain one we have four

88
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,720
for the remainder

89
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,319
two we have eight

90
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,799
two these two numbers also remain two

91
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,040
this one also remain one look we have

92
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,519
two numbers in the remainder one we have

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,000
two numbers in the remain two so we

94
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,239
compare so we can pair four plus two or

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,519
we can play four plus a we can play one

96
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,959
plus a or we can play one plus two okay

97
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,000
so it has to be

98
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,840
an equal number of numbers in each pool

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
so each pool is the remainder yeah

100
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,000
remember four yeah got it

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,120
okay so define partition

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,080
k divisible number the number okay

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,240
so if the the number of elements in that

104
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,759
rate is odd number can we pair can we

105
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,199
plan why is that because

106
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,040
that's right because for example if i

107
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,560
give you five numbers can you can you

108
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,560
form them in pair no because they're

109
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,759
always one extra right

110
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,800
one

111
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,000
two

112
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,590
three

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,620
four and then

114
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,620
[Music]

115
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,919
ah okay

116
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,120
okay that's great so first of all first

117
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:16,080
of all n equals the length of numbers so

118
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,400
this has to be a even number if it's uh

119
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,360
if it's all number if it's a down number

120
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,639
will determine easy then we store the i

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,199
plus k uh i'm i modulus k in the

122
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,960
dictionary so we use the s for example s

123
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,400
equals before

124
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,120
this generally

125
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,160
the default time is in by default the

126
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,000
intel gives the value default value zero

127
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,800
when the key is not existing okay and

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,759
then we go through this number for i in

129
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,039
nums and then s i

130
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,120
modulus k plus equal one okay so we are

131
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,560
incrementing we are storing the

132
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:57,280
frequency remember remember these though

133
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,560
uh 4 a to 1 and k equals 3 so what we

134
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,360
are doing is that 1 s equals i modulus k

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:08,080
equals 1 and i'll be 4 and 1

136
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:11,039
now so s 1 is two in this case and then

137
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,120
the the other the remainder two

138
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,759
remainder two is two

139
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,680
a and two and then s two

140
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,479
is also two right two numbers here two

141
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,039
numbers here we have to consider the

142
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,840
special case when the remainder is 0

143
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,560
right if s 0 is a whole number we still

144
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,919
need to return 4 right for example for

145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:36,000
example like if we have k equals 3

146
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:39,199
and then number is 369 right so these

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,160
numbers itself can be divisible by k so

148
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,840
we need even number of it right because

149
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,560
it can't so

150
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,039
these numbers have its own

151
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,440
three six nine right if

152
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,520
there are odd number of the numbers here

153
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,800
right so what happens so you can't find

154
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,800
a pair

155
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,840
it doesn't find it doesn't have its pair

156
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,599
okay it doesn't have its pair

157
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,080
so we need to return first otherwise we

158
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,080
just have to check the remainder i

159
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,720
needs to pair with k minus i then we

160
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,360
return fourth are you okay returns five

161
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,680
otherwise if we can't find anything here

162
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,479
then we can show so this whole thing

163
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
these

164
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,479
this number of lines can also be

165
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,479
rewritten as return all

166
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,039
s i equal equal s i k minus i

167
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,720
for i in range one k so the time

168
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,240
complexity is a when the space

169
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,680
complexity is always because we are

170
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,120
using that

171
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,039
we're using the deformation right the

172
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,880
number we go through the numbers yeah

173
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,360
once right

174
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,000
we can use that another way to uh to

175
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,840
write it quite okay so so the idea is

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,879
that when we find the numbers we can

177
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,360
just increment the counter right and we

178
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,759
if we don't find this number in the pair

179
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,400
we just decrement it right

180
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,120
f equals d4

181
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,160
dictionary in okay and then we c equals

182
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,440
zero c equals zero okay and then we just

183
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,919
go through this number for i in numbers

184
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,120
and then we just say a is the number i

185
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,440
divided by k b is the num the other

186
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,039
number in the pair so which is k minus a

187
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,360
divided by k

188
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,440
and then if f a

189
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,080
is bigger than zero then we what we do

190
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,759
we just decrement it f a minus equals

191
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:25,680
one c minus equals one as

192
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,199
fb plus equals one c plus equals one and

193
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,039
at the end we just have to check if

194
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,520
return c equal equal to zero okay so

195
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,760
that's why i say a and b is two numbers

196
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,240
in a pair if f a frequency bigger than

197
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,560
zero we have we have the numbers in the

198
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,039
pair then we decrement it we decrement

199
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,159
otherwise we increment it okay so at the

200
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,720
end

201
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,360
the numbers need to be needs to come in

202
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,360
the pairs this is one time because look

203
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,440
goes through these numbers and we use we

204
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,360
use the dictionary so that's one space

205
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,839
as well okay so to sum up what have you

206
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,839
learned today

207
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,480
uh the facebook okay so we have an array

208
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,800
of numbers the arrays

209
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,240
contains all positive numbers and we

210
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,240
want to position we want to find out if

211
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,560
we can partition the numbers into pairs

212
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,360
and each sum of the sum of each pair

213
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,600
needs to be divided by k right divided

214
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,560
by k and then we what are we doing here

215
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,760
is we use a dictionary to store the

216
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,480
storage remainder by k divide divided by

217
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,440
k remainder right for example k 3 if the

218
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,040
number divided by k remain 2 and the

219
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,920
number needs to be paired with the

220
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,440
number which divided by k remain 1

221
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:40,200
because 2 plus 1 is a multiple of k

222
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,200
right okay that's it for today bye
