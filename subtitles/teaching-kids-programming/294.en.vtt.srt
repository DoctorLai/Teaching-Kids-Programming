okay so today we talk about some um
easy problems mathematics problem okay

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
easy problems mathematics problem okay
 

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,990
easy problems mathematics problem okay
so look

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
so look
 

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,270
so look
if a guy wants to

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,280
if a guy wants to
 

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,510
if a guy wants to
build a wall but this is the old world

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
build a wall but this is the old world
 

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,870
build a wall but this is the old world
yeah all the wall okay

12
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
yeah all the wall okay
 

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,029
yeah all the wall okay
and then he has this the he wants to

14
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
and then he has this the he wants to
 

15
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,269
and then he has this the he wants to
build a rectangular wall

16
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
build a rectangular wall
 

17
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,589
build a rectangular wall
and then look at the tentacle

18
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
and then look at the tentacle
 

19
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,669
and then look at the tentacle
retainer

20
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
retainer
 

21
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,229
retainer
and then he has the lens of this lens

22
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
and then he has the lens of this lens
 

23
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,150
and then he has the lens of this lens
this lens

24
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
this lens
 

25
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,510
this lens
right here is the lens he has to he

26
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
right here is the lens he has to he
 

27
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,869
right here is the lens he has to he
wants to use the total lens of 32 this

28
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
wants to use the total lens of 32 this
 

29
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,110
wants to use the total lens of 32 this
is nine okay 32

30
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
is nine okay 32
 

31
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,630
is nine okay 32
right and then

32
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
right and then
 

33
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,950
right and then
it has to be a rectangular wall

34
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
it has to be a rectangular wall
 

35
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,630
it has to be a rectangular wall
and what's the maximum we want to

36
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
and what's the maximum we want to
 

37
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,869
and what's the maximum we want to
maximum this area

38
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
maximum this area
 

39
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,310
maximum this area
i don't get it

40
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
i don't get it
 

41
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,270
i don't get it
area so look these plus so what

42
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
area so look these plus so what
 

43
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,590
area so look these plus so what
this this old wall and then he has the

44
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
this this old wall and then he has the
 

45
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,670
this this old wall and then he has the
length of these three what what do you

46
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
length of these three what what do you
 

47
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,270
length of these three what what do you
call this you want to build the wall of

48
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
call this you want to build the wall of
 

49
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,709
call this you want to build the wall of
this

50
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
this
 

51
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,270
this
yeah yeah okay so let's that's the

52
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
yeah yeah okay so let's that's the
 

53
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,710
yeah yeah okay so let's that's the
height okay

54
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
height okay
 

55
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,109
height okay
height and that's the width

56
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
height and that's the width
 

57
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,230
height and that's the width
okay

58
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
okay
 

59
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,030
okay
so

60
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
so
 

61
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,350
so
so what can we do with the 32

62
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
so what can we do with the 32
 

63
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,510
so what can we do with the 32
h plus h plus w equals 32 right

64
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
h plus h plus w equals 32 right
 

65
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,270
h plus h plus w equals 32 right
yeah okay this is 9 right yeah and we

66
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
yeah okay this is 9 right yeah and we
 

67
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,190
yeah okay this is 9 right yeah and we
want to maximize what's the area of this

68
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
want to maximize what's the area of this
 

69
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,390
want to maximize what's the area of this
rectangle

70
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400

 

71
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,789

it must be h plus h plus w plus

72
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
it must be h plus h plus w plus
 

73
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,429
it must be h plus h plus w plus
no no no no the area not the length the

74
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
no no no no the area not the length the
 

75
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:39,030
no no no no the area not the length the
length is these three piece

76
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040

 

77
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,710

error yeah of anti-clockwise so we want

78
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
error yeah of anti-clockwise so we want
 

79
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,789
error yeah of anti-clockwise so we want
to maximize this

80
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
to maximize this
 

81
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,270
to maximize this
we want to maximize this okay what do

82
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
we want to maximize this okay what do
 

83
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,429
we want to maximize this okay what do
you mean maximize to make it bigger the

84
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
you mean maximize to make it bigger the
 

85
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,670
you mean maximize to make it bigger the
largest yeah that's the one of the

86
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
largest yeah that's the one of the
 

87
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,469
largest yeah that's the one of the
problem in your book right yeah remember

88
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
problem in your book right yeah remember
 

89
00:01:52,479 --> 00:02:05,109
problem in your book right yeah remember
you get your

90
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119

 

91
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,110

you know these cheeses

92
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,120
you know these cheeses
 

93
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:20,949
you know these cheeses
[Music]

95
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,270

hr integer right the pieces you know

96
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
hr integer right the pieces you know
 

97
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,270
hr integer right the pieces you know
that i i don't know what you call it the

98
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
that i i don't know what you call it the
 

99
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,869
that i i don't know what you call it the
bricks

100
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
bricks
 

101
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,670
bricks
this unit one unit two units so we can

102
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
this unit one unit two units so we can
 

103
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,750
this unit one unit two units so we can
prove first we can prove our switch

104
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
prove first we can prove our switch
 

105
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,270
prove first we can prove our switch
either with w the width or h right or

106
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
either with w the width or h right or
 

107
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,589
either with w the width or h right or
eight what's the minimum width you can

108
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
eight what's the minimum width you can
 

109
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,110
eight what's the minimum width you can
we can try

110
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
we can try
 

111
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,550
we can try
um

112
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
um
 

113
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,790
um
so we can this is the table

114
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
so we can this is the table
 

115
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,509
so we can this is the table
right we can this is the table

116
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
right we can this is the table
 

117
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,110
right we can this is the table
yeah can we call it this okay it's

118
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
yeah can we call it this okay it's
 

119
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,869
yeah can we call it this okay it's
bigger than the height

120
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
bigger than the height
 

121
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,589
bigger than the height
what do you want to eat uh proof what do

122
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
what do you want to eat uh proof what do
 

123
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,470
what do you want to eat uh proof what do
you want to try to you can try with edge

124
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
you want to try to you can try with edge
 

125
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,830
you want to try to you can try with edge
or you can try without it up to you

126
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
or you can try without it up to you
 

127
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,350
or you can try without it up to you
pick one

128
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
pick one
 

129
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,670
pick one
w okay let's do this

130
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
w okay let's do this
 

131
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,670
w okay let's do this
w okay

132
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
w okay
 

133
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,149
w okay
w and then we have second column h and

134
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
w and then we have second column h and
 

135
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,309
w and then we have second column h and
then that would be the area okay

136
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
then that would be the area okay
 

137
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,910
then that would be the area okay
area

138
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
area
 

139
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,229
area
okay we just need the is the list of

140
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
okay we just need the is the list of
 

141
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,589
okay we just need the is the list of
area

142
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
area
 

143
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,630
area
okay but when w is one what's h what's

144
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
okay but when w is one what's h what's
 

145
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,509
okay but when w is one what's h what's
the value of edge y area

146
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
the value of edge y area
 

147
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,790
the value of edge y area
actually equals 32 minus w divided by

148
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
actually equals 32 minus w divided by
 

149
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,390
actually equals 32 minus w divided by
two right all right

150
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
two right all right
 

151
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,309
two right all right
look yeah yeah

so
so what so what's that

164
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
so what so what's that
 

165
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,309
so what so what's that
so yeah okay so what's the value of

166
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
so yeah okay so what's the value of
 

167
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,390
so yeah okay so what's the value of
this part

168
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
this part
 

169
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,149
this part
you can do it's fine 31 31 divided by 2

170
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
you can do it's fine 31 31 divided by 2
 

171
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,949
you can do it's fine 31 31 divided by 2
right

172
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
right
 

173
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,670
right
yeah what's the area what's the area w

174
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
yeah what's the area what's the area w
 

175
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,070
yeah what's the area what's the area w
times h would be

176
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
times h would be
 

177
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,750
times h would be
right yeah that's the 15.5 right

178
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
right yeah that's the 15.5 right
 

179
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,869
right yeah that's the 15.5 right
okay so we can write it as 15 from 5 15

180
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
okay so we can write it as 15 from 5 15
 

181
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,670
okay so we can write it as 15 from 5 15
to 0.5 okay let's try to

182
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
to 0.5 okay let's try to
 

183
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,429
to 0.5 okay let's try to
let's move forward in here both sides

184
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
let's move forward in here both sides
 

185
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,710
let's move forward in here both sides
what's the

186
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
what's the
 

187
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,710
what's the
15

188
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
15
 

189
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,229
15
and what's the area um

190
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239

 

191
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,710

okay look yeah i know we can try keep

192
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
okay look yeah i know we can try keep
 

193
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,909
okay look yeah i know we can try keep
going man

194
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
going man
 

195
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,710
going man
let's do a few three

196
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
let's do a few three
 

197
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,550
let's do a few three
three

198
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
three
 

199
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,110
three
29 divided by two and then these would

200
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
29 divided by two and then these would
 

201
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,469
29 divided by two and then these would
be

202
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
be
 

203
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,670
be
i don't know three times 14.5 okay so

204
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
i don't know three times 14.5 okay so
 

205
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,110
i don't know three times 14.5 okay so
it's bigger yeah so

206
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
it's bigger yeah so
 

207
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,670
it's bigger yeah so
basically we we just want to try this

208
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
basically we we just want to try this
 

209
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,469
basically we we just want to try this
yeah

210
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
yeah
 

211
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,909
yeah
try at least w try each w

212
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
try at least w try each w
 

213
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,830
try at least w try each w
no no it's not going to take about how

214
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:39,840
no no it's not going to take about how
 

215
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,270
no no it's not going to take about how
how much

216
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
how much
 

217
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,870
how much
what's the maximum

218
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
what's the maximum
 

219
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,950
what's the maximum
number we can try

220
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
number we can try
 

221
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,070
number we can try
come on

222
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
come on
 

223
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,390
come on
a hundred why is a hundred come on like

224
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
a hundred why is a hundred come on like
 

225
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,430
a hundred why is a hundred come on like
given

226
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
given
 

227
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,909
given
given condition 32

228
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
given condition 32
 

229
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,070
given condition 32
yeah so all you not even 32 31 up to 31

230
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
yeah so all you not even 32 31 up to 31
 

231
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,150
yeah so all you not even 32 31 up to 31
right because 32 the edge will be zero

232
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
right because 32 the edge will be zero
 

233
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,390
right because 32 the edge will be zero
you'll be aligned that's not possible

234
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
you'll be aligned that's not possible
 

235
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,790
you'll be aligned that's not possible
right you're not beating a wall

236
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
right you're not beating a wall
 

237
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,830
right you're not beating a wall
then it has to be half

238
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
then it has to be half
 

239
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,990
then it has to be half
i don't know yeah if it's immediate yeah

240
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
i don't know yeah if it's immediate yeah
 

241
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,710
i don't know yeah if it's immediate yeah
you can try okay this is this

242
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
you can try okay this is this
 

243
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,870
you can try okay this is this
this is performing we try and we can ask

244
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
this is performing we try and we can ask
 

245
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,790
this is performing we try and we can ask
computers to try that okay let's do this

246
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
computers to try that okay let's do this
 

247
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,870
computers to try that okay let's do this
computer thing and i talk to you about

248
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
computer thing and i talk to you about
 

249
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,710
computer thing and i talk to you about
the mathematic which is

250
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
the mathematic which is
 

251
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,270
the mathematic which is
is even better in this case so how do we

252
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
is even better in this case so how do we
 

253
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,510
is even better in this case so how do we
move our thing we can prove what in the

254
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
move our thing we can prove what in the
 

255
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,270
move our thing we can prove what in the
wx

256
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280

 

257
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,029

w plus 2 times h equals 32 and what we

258
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
w plus 2 times h equals 32 and what we
 

259
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,029
w plus 2 times h equals 32 and what we
want is w times h

260
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
want is w times h
 

261
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,350
want is w times h
we want to calculate this the maximum

262
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
we want to calculate this the maximum
 

263
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,670
we want to calculate this the maximum
right we want to get to the maximum size

264
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
right we want to get to the maximum size
 

265
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,870
right we want to get to the maximum size
of this one

266
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
of this one
 

267
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,550
of this one
right right

268
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
right right
 

269
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,510
right right
yeah

270
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
yeah
 

271
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,270
yeah
okay so how look the first of all we

272
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
okay so how look the first of all we
 

273
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,990
okay so how look the first of all we
want to say the answer equals zero right

274
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
want to say the answer equals zero right
 

275
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,950
want to say the answer equals zero right
yeah

276
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
yeah
 

277
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,710
yeah
and then we we want to find out we want

278
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
and then we we want to find out we want
 

279
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,629
and then we we want to find out we want
to keep the uh we want to go for four

280
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
to keep the uh we want to go for four
 

281
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,230
to keep the uh we want to go for four
w yeah

282
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
w yeah
 

283
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,430
w yeah
alternatively you can go with h right

284
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
alternatively you can go with h right
 

285
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,909
alternatively you can go with h right
yes we swipe with the h maybe easier

286
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
yes we swipe with the h maybe easier
 

287
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,710
yes we swipe with the h maybe easier
right for h in

288
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
right for h in
 

289
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,670
right for h in
range

290
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
range
 

291
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,710
range
we start from one up to up to one after

292
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
we start from one up to up to one after
 

293
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,430
we start from one up to up to one after
one right

294
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440

 

295
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,309

the thing one is one

296
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
the thing one is one
 

297
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,230
the thing one is one
look at the all

298
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
look at the all
 

299
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,590
look at the all
edge

300
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
edge
 

301
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,670
edge
h uh

302
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
h uh
 

303
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,990
h uh
i don't know maybe up to up to what up

304
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
i don't know maybe up to up to what up
 

305
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,710
i don't know maybe up to up to what up
to 16 right you can't be over than 16

306
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
to 16 right you can't be over than 16
 

307
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,710
to 16 right you can't be over than 16
because the oval is 16 then this will be

308
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
because the oval is 16 then this will be
 

309
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,189
because the oval is 16 then this will be
over 32 and this will be negative right

310
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
over 32 and this will be negative right
 

311
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,990
over 32 and this will be negative right
all right yeah so let's say 16 okay

312
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
all right yeah so let's say 16 okay
 

313
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,590
all right yeah so let's say 16 okay
let's make it

314
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
let's make it
 

315
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,230
let's make it
16 and that'll be the maximum will be 15

316
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
16 and that'll be the maximum will be 15
 

317
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,350
16 and that'll be the maximum will be 15
okay

318
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
okay
 

319
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,629
okay
okay look at h is that and what w equals

320
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
okay look at h is that and what w equals
 

321
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,670
okay look at h is that and what w equals
1

322
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
1
 

323
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,189
1
32

324
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
32
 

325
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,629
32
minus 2 times h right yeah

326
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
minus 2 times h right yeah
 

327
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,830
minus 2 times h right yeah
am i look here yay

328
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
am i look here yay
 

329
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,070
am i look here yay
okay totally equal 32 minus 2 times h

330
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
okay totally equal 32 minus 2 times h
 

331
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,070
okay totally equal 32 minus 2 times h
and what's the area what's that i don't

332
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
and what's the area what's that i don't
 

333
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,830
and what's the area what's that i don't
you need to check if x

334
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
you need to check if x
 

335
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,150
you need to check if x
do we need to check uh no we don't need

336
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
do we need to check uh no we don't need
 

337
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,270
do we need to check uh no we don't need
to check right because look if up to 16

338
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
to check right because look if up to 16
 

339
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,430
to check right because look if up to 16
and this will be always bigger than zero

340
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
and this will be always bigger than zero
 

341
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,909
and this will be always bigger than zero
right w will be oh it's bigger than zero

342
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
right w will be oh it's bigger than zero
 

343
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,270
right w will be oh it's bigger than zero
all right

344
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
all right
 

345
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,909
all right
yeah if it's only energy

346
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919

 

347
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,830

times h

348
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
times h
 

349
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,710
times h
bigger than answer

350
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
bigger than answer
 

351
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,909
bigger than answer
right then we keep the answer equals w

352
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
right then we keep the answer equals w
 

353
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,670
right then we keep the answer equals w
times h

354
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
times h
 

355
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,790
times h
yeah

356
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
yeah
 

357
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,710
yeah
i know we at last we just return the

358
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
i know we at last we just return the
 

359
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,749
i know we at last we just return the
answer this is the maximum area we can

360
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
answer this is the maximum area we can
 

361
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,430
answer this is the maximum area we can
we can get

362
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440

 

363
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,670

you see four is it we're trying the

364
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
you see four is it we're trying the
 

365
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,510
you see four is it we're trying the
integer are we only trying integer look

366
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
integer are we only trying integer look
 

367
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,830
integer are we only trying integer look
we are only trying the integer because

368
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
we are only trying the integer because
 

369
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,390
we are only trying the integer because
if it is not integer we we can't try

370
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
if it is not integer we we can't try
 

371
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,309
if it is not integer we we can't try
right because there's so many fraction

372
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
right because there's so many fraction
 

373
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,270
right because there's so many fraction
numbers like 0.1.2 yeah there's so many

374
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
numbers like 0.1.2 yeah there's so many
 

375
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,150
numbers like 0.1.2 yeah there's so many
many

376
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
many
 

377
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,670
many
numbers right

378
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:47,680
numbers right
 

379
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,150
numbers right
so you can't actually pull for things

380
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
so you can't actually pull for things
 

381
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,909
so you can't actually pull for things
well if we want to brief watching we

382
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
well if we want to brief watching we
 

383
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,950
well if we want to brief watching we
have to

384
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
have to
 

385
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,390
have to
we we have to try this limited number of

386
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
we we have to try this limited number of
 

387
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,390
we we have to try this limited number of
solutions right like like

388
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
solutions right like like
 

389
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,230
solutions right like like
this domain has to be limited it can't

390
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
this domain has to be limited it can't
 

391
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,950
this domain has to be limited it can't
be

392
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
be
 

393
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,350
be
ultimately large right

394
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
ultimately large right
 

395
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,510
ultimately large right
and luckily at this case we only tried

396
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
and luckily at this case we only tried
 

397
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,629
and luckily at this case we only tried
16 times like right from 1 to 15 right

398
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
16 times like right from 1 to 15 right
 

399
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,189
16 times like right from 1 to 15 right
it's actually 15 solutions we saw with

400
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
it's actually 15 solutions we saw with
 

401
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,550
it's actually 15 solutions we saw with
this so instead of w h with this h w

402
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
this so instead of w h with this h w
 

403
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,510
this so instead of w h with this h w
right actually equals one

404
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
right actually equals one
 

405
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,589
right actually equals one
we calculate w we can't get the error h

406
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
we calculate w we can't get the error h
 

407
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,029
we calculate w we can't get the error h
equals two up to 15 right

408
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
equals two up to 15 right
 

409
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,589
equals two up to 15 right
only twice 15.

410
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
only twice 15.
 

411
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,390
only twice 15.
yeah

412
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
yeah
 

413
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,990
yeah
what's the time complexion for this one

414
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
what's the time complexion for this one
 

415
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,070
what's the time complexion for this one
come on

416
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
come on
 

417
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,430
come on
think about it what else the ham

418
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
think about it what else the ham
 

419
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,350
think about it what else the ham
convexity oh and and a little bit more

420
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
convexity oh and and a little bit more
 

421
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:43,909
convexity oh and and a little bit more
look this is the concept

422
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919

 

423
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,829

actually there's no input right because

424
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
actually there's no input right because
 

425
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,150
actually there's no input right because
all the inputs are known right

426
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
all the inputs are known right
 

427
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,750
all the inputs are known right
the inputs are known

428
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
the inputs are known
 

429
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,430
the inputs are known
yeah so n no no

430
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440

 

431
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,750

there's no input okay so there's no

432
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
there's no input okay so there's no
 

433
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,670
there's no input okay so there's no
input there's no meaning of doing this

434
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
input there's no meaning of doing this
 

435
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,430
input there's no meaning of doing this
uh complexity

436
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
uh complexity
 

437
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,750
uh complexity
uh analysis right because

438
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
uh analysis right because
 

439
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,829
uh analysis right because
the problem size is fixed and we are

440
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
the problem size is fixed and we are
 

441
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,509
the problem size is fixed and we are
we're only solving this mathematic

442
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
we're only solving this mathematic
 

443
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,030
we're only solving this mathematic
problem okay

444
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
problem okay
 

445
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,350
problem okay
if we want to keep the if if we want to

446
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
if we want to keep the if if we want to
 

447
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,949
if we want to keep the if if we want to
know

448
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
know
 

449
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,509
know
if we want to know which number which w

450
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
if we want to know which number which w
 

451
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,389
if we want to know which number which w
or value which w and h when we get the

452
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
or value which w and h when we get the
 

453
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,550
or value which w and h when we get the
maximum so we can say look we can have

454
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
maximum so we can say look we can have
 

455
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,550
maximum so we can say look we can have
this and we want to try this h ui so we

456
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
this and we want to try this h ui so we
 

457
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,269
this and we want to try this h ui so we
have max x equals one and then look if w

458
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
have max x equals one and then look if w
 

459
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,949
have max x equals one and then look if w
times h

460
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
times h
 

461
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,630
times h
bigger than answer we we call the

462
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
bigger than answer we we call the
 

463
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,190
bigger than answer we we call the
maximum area and then we at the same

464
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
maximum area and then we at the same
 

465
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,630
maximum area and then we at the same
time we remember the max h

466
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
time we remember the max h
 

467
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,310
time we remember the max h
which is max h equals yeah that's right

468
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
which is max h equals yeah that's right
 

469
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,829
which is max h equals yeah that's right
does it make sense yeah yeah okay

470
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
does it make sense yeah yeah okay
 

471
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,910
does it make sense yeah yeah okay
okay now i'm going to teach you about

472
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
okay now i'm going to teach you about
 

473
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,670
okay now i'm going to teach you about
mathematics which is

474
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
mathematics which is
 

475
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,910
mathematics which is
very cool you you're surprised how how

476
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
very cool you you're surprised how how
 

477
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,910
very cool you you're surprised how how
useful is this okay

478
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
useful is this okay
 

479
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,630
useful is this okay
i will not say what okay so first of all

480
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
i will not say what okay so first of all
 

481
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,110
i will not say what okay so first of all
i want to introduce a few english words

482
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
i want to introduce a few english words
 

483
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,269
i want to introduce a few english words
which one the first one is you might

484
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
which one the first one is you might
 

485
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,350
which one the first one is you might
have heard of this before yeah cool

486
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
have heard of this before yeah cool
 

487
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,910
have heard of this before yeah cool
what's called

488
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
what's called
 

489
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,509
what's called
quadratic

490
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519

 

491
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,150

one two two quadratic okay another

492
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
one two two quadratic okay another
 

493
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,269
one two two quadratic okay another
equation and then we have this one

494
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
equation and then we have this one
 

495
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,389
equation and then we have this one
three symmetric symmetric

496
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
three symmetric symmetric
 

497
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,110
three symmetric symmetric
hx6 what does it mean symmetric the

498
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
hx6 what does it mean symmetric the
 

499
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,470
hx6 what does it mean symmetric the
magic i use is this thing you can fold

500
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
magic i use is this thing you can fold
 

501
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,630
magic i use is this thing you can fold
it yeah you can fold it okay good job

502
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
it yeah you can fold it okay good job
 

503
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,949
it yeah you can fold it okay good job
and how about this okay

504
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
and how about this okay
 

505
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:40,410
and how about this okay
oh

how we go
 

519
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,030
how we go
it's like look look how it goes like you

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
gravity yeah yeah the earthquake because
 

553
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,990
gravity yeah yeah the earthquake because
the gravity we have this gravity g and

554
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
the gravity we have this gravity g and
 

555
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,990
the gravity we have this gravity g and
then we're putting the things

556
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
then we're putting the things
 

557
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,910
then we're putting the things
[ __ ] f right okay so

558
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
[ __ ] f right okay so
 

559
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,910
[ __ ] f right okay so
there's a

560
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
there's a
 

561
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,750
there's a
this is the object this is the object

562
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
this is the object this is the object
 

563
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,910
this is the object this is the object
and then you have f right

564
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
and then you have f right
 

565
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,389
and then you have f right
and i now have a g and then that's why

566
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
and i now have a g and then that's why
 

567
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,470
and i now have a g and then that's why
you'll be something

okay so okay so
so uh so parabola is is is the

572
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
so uh so parabola is is is the
 

573
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,710
so uh so parabola is is is the
mathematic right like look

574
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
mathematic right like look
 

575
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,629
mathematic right like look
remember this x y right this is x

576
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
remember this x y right this is x
 

577
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,710
remember this x y right this is x
this is y

578
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
this is y
 

579
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,310
this is y
okay so

580
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
okay so
 

581
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,389
okay so
okay if i have a function y equals x

582
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
okay if i have a function y equals x
 

583
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,710
okay if i have a function y equals x
squared look square

584
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
squared look square
 

585
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,750
squared look square
x times x this is quadratic because it's

586
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
x times x this is quadratic because it's
 

587
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,150
x times x this is quadratic because it's
8 squared okay

588
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
8 squared okay
 

589
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,990
8 squared okay
what when x is 0 what's the value of y

590
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
what when x is 0 what's the value of y

when x is one what's the value of y

596
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
when x is one what's the value of y
 

597
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,310
when x is one what's the value of y
only one one ah this is one here okay

598
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
only one one ah this is one here okay
 

599
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,590
only one one ah this is one here okay
when x is two what's the value of y four

600
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
when x is two what's the value of y four
 

601
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,430
when x is two what's the value of y four
okay so that's one

602
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
okay so that's one
 

603
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,470
okay so that's one
two

604
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480

three
 

607
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,350
three
four so that's fine

00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
four so that's fine
 

609
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,710
four so that's fine
so look one two three four when x is two

610
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
so look one two three four when x is two
 

611
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,670
so look one two three four when x is two
y is four right so it should be here

612
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
y is four right so it should be here
 

613
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,110
y is four right so it should be here
five okay

five okay
 

615
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,069
five okay
so if you own actually three

616
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
so if you own actually three
 

617
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,509
so if you own actually three
so it's somewhere here so actually if

what is minus two it's also four so look
 

665
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,069
what is minus two it's also four so look
what this means symmetric axis yeah

666
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079

 

667
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,790

yeah it can be folded along these so

668
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
yeah it can be folded along these so
 

669
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,430
yeah it can be folded along these so
what does measuring x is in this case y

670
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
what does measuring x is in this case y
 

671
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,670
what does measuring x is in this case y
equals x squared

672
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
equals x squared
 

673
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,389
equals x squared
y equals y equals x squared what's

674
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
y equals y equals x squared what's
 

675
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,710
y equals y equals x squared what's
which one is the symmetric axis

676
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
which one is the symmetric axis
 

677
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,470
which one is the symmetric axis
come on so this which one is the

678
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
come on so this which one is the
 

679
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,470
come on so this which one is the
semester x

680
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
semester x
 

681
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,350
semester x
um

682
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
um
 

683
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,550
um
these

684
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
these
 

685
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,910
these
symmetric

686
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
symmetric
 

687
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,790
symmetric
why are they floating too

688
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800

 

689
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,590

sorry okay so look
so

700
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
so
 

701
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,949
so
what value

702
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
what value
 

703
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,750
what value
so this this this function every

704
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
so this this this function every
 

705
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,069
so this this this function every
function of this y uh so this is

706
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
function of this y uh so this is
 

707
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,910
function of this y uh so this is
conjecture function okay the quadratic

708
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
conjecture function okay the quadratic
 

709
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,870

yeah y equals that right
 

719
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,389
yeah y equals that right
what does it mean a b c are constant

720
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
what does it mean a b c are constant
 

721
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,790
what does it mean a b c are constant
okay so can you tell me y equals x

722
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
okay so can you tell me y equals x

of the of of the constant that
 

779
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,870
of the of of the constant that
comes before these quadratic terms right

780
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
comes before these quadratic terms right
 

781
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,749
comes before these quadratic terms right
and b is the linear term c is a constant

782

and b is the linear term c is a constant
 

783
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,350
and b is the linear term c is a constant
right

784
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
right
 

785
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,189
right
why is it useful

786
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
why is it useful
 

787
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,389
why is it useful
why is it useful because we control this

788
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
why is it useful because we control this
 

789
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,069
why is it useful because we control this
we can draw this

790
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
we can draw this
 

791
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,910
we can draw this
like that yeah this this uh

792
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
like that yeah this this uh
 

793
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,150
like that yeah this this uh
when c is zero what does it mean when c

794
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
when c is zero what does it mean when c
 

795
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,069
when c is zero what does it mean when c
is zero

796
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079
is zero
 

797
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,110
is zero
this function goes to the zero zero zero

798
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
this function goes to the zero zero zero
 

799
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,990
this function goes to the zero zero zero
right

800
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
right
 

801
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,870
right
yeah look if you put a zero in

802
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
yeah look if you put a zero in
 

803
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,470
yeah look if you put a zero in
this term will be zero p x will be zero

804
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
this term will be zero p x will be zero
 

805
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,269
this term will be zero p x will be zero
right

806
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
right
 

807
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,389
right
i want t is zero y is zero right

808
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
i want t is zero y is zero right
 

809
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,550
i want t is zero y is zero right
yeah yes

810
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
yeah yes
 

811
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,470
yeah yes
okay so if a is positive like a a is one

812
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
okay so if a is positive like a a is one
 

813
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,870
okay so if a is positive like a a is one
it will be like that how about a is

814
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
it will be like that how about a is
 

815
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,110
it will be like that how about a is
negative like minus

816
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
negative like minus
 

817
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,669
negative like minus
y equals minus x square so what does it

818
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:05,679
y equals minus x square so what does it
 

819
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,909
y equals minus x square so what does it
look like

820
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:07,919
look like
 

821
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,029
look like
can you imagine why what i told you i

822
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
can you imagine why what i told you i
 

823
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,429
can you imagine why what i told you i
you know y equals x square is here and

824
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
you know y equals x square is here and
 

825
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,230
you know y equals x square is here and
how about if i put the negative

826
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,240
how about if i put the negative
 

827
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,590
how about if i put the negative
still

828
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600

 

829
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,390

look when x equals one what what's the

830
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
look when x equals one what what's the
 

831
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,390
look when x equals one what what's the
you can you can have the value y equals

832
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
you can you can have the value y equals
 

833
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,669
you can you can have the value y equals
one minus one right one x equals two

834
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
one minus one right one x equals two
 

835
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,870
one minus one right one x equals two
what y equals one

836
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
what y equals one
 

837
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,510
what y equals one
four right yeah so it's on this side

838
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
four right yeah so it's on this side
 

839
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,909
four right yeah so it's on this side
why is mine i literally said that also

840
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
why is mine i literally said that also
 

841
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,750
why is mine i literally said that also
can you draw because i'm not sure what

842
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
can you draw because i'm not sure what
 

843
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,190
can you draw because i'm not sure what
do you mean

844
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
do you mean
 

845
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,430
do you mean
okay we're done can you draw

846
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
okay we're done can you draw
 

847
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:52,870
okay we're done can you draw
on which side i saw you mean

848
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880

 

849
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,590

so when when a is negative it will be

850
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
so when when a is negative it will be
 

851
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,830
so when when a is negative it will be
something like that right when a is

852
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
something like that right when a is
 

853
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,510
something like that right when a is
positive it will be something like that

854
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
positive it will be something like that
 

855
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,190
positive it will be something like that
right okay that's the first thing so

856
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
right okay that's the first thing so
 

857
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,230
right okay that's the first thing so
and if we find a symmetric axis we can

858
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
and if we find a symmetric axis we can
 

859
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,789
and if we find a symmetric axis we can
find that we can find the maximum and

860
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
find that we can find the maximum and
 

861
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,150
find that we can find the maximum and
mean or we can find the minimum right of

862
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
mean or we can find the minimum right of
 

863
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,590
mean or we can find the minimum right of
the function

864
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
the function
 

865
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,029
the function
at this point

866
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
at this point
 

867
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,430
at this point
yeah if a is particular or we can find

868
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
yeah if a is particular or we can find
 

869
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,789
yeah if a is particular or we can find
the maximum

870
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
the maximum
 

871
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,590
the maximum
value of this function if a is negative

872
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
value of this function if a is negative
 

873
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,390
value of this function if a is negative
right

874
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
right
 

875
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,909
right
right

876
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
right
 

877
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,789
right
and okay so what's this part okay

878
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
and okay so what's this part okay
 

879
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,870
and okay so what's this part okay
okay this part okay

880
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
okay this part okay
 

881
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,270
okay this part okay
this is the most important thing here

882
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
this is the most important thing here
 

883
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,390
this is the most important thing here
this axis symmetric axis is

884
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400
this axis symmetric axis is
 

885
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,549
this axis symmetric axis is
minus look

886
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
minus look
 

887
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,310
minus look
two times a b okay this is

888
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,320
two times a b okay this is
 

889
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,909
two times a b okay this is
yeah this is the symmetric

890
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
yeah this is the symmetric
 

891
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,430
yeah this is the symmetric
x value

892
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
x value
 

893
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,630
x value
so when x equals these

894
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
so when x equals these
 

895
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,190
so when x equals these
we have a minimum

896
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
we have a minimum
 

897
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,830
we have a minimum
or maximum value of this function

898
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:54,840
or maximum value of this function
 

899
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,070
or maximum value of this function
okay minus b divided by two times a for

900
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
okay minus b divided by two times a for
 

901
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,909
okay minus b divided by two times a for
example look

902
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
example look
 

903
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:00,789
example look
uh

904
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:00,799
uh
 

905
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,909
uh
a a and b look b is zero so so

906
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
a a and b look b is zero so so
 

907
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,590
a a and b look b is zero so so
when b is yellow this whole thing is

908
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
when b is yellow this whole thing is
 

909
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,029
when b is yellow this whole thing is
zero right

910
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
zero right
 

911
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,430
zero right
yeah and this whole thing is zero so the

912
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
yeah and this whole thing is zero so the
 

913
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,830
yeah and this whole thing is zero so the
symmetric axis is this yeah actually

914
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
symmetric axis is this yeah actually
 

915
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,830
symmetric axis is this yeah actually
goes zero correct

916
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
goes zero correct
 

917
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,150
goes zero correct
okay so look this whole thing can be

918
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160
okay so look this whole thing can be
 

919
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,549
okay so look this whole thing can be
shifted right shifted left or right

920
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
shifted right shifted left or right
 

921
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,110
shifted right shifted left or right
depending on this lump at least

922
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,120
depending on this lump at least
 

923
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,630
depending on this lump at least
right got it yeah yeah okay so now we

924
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
right got it yeah yeah okay so now we
 

925
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,310
right got it yeah yeah okay so now we
have this basics then we can come back

926
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
have this basics then we can come back
 

927
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,270
have this basics then we can come back
to solve the problem very very easy

928
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
to solve the problem very very easy
 

929
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,350
to solve the problem very very easy
very very easy okay how can we solve

930
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
very very easy okay how can we solve
 

931
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,390
very very easy okay how can we solve
this

932
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400

 

933
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,070

look at this thing last thing again okay

934
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
look at this thing last thing again okay
 

935
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,350
look at this thing last thing again okay
this is like

936
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
this is like
 

937
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,190
this is like
of the word

938
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
of the word
 

939
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,549
of the word
and the guy wants to build a new like

940
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
and the guy wants to build a new like
 

941
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,950
and the guy wants to build a new like
new fence okay let's go different this

942
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960
new fence okay let's go different this
 

943
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,710
new fence okay let's go different this
is h

944
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
is h
 

945
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,310
is h
this is w okay and we know w plus 2

946
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
this is w okay and we know w plus 2
 

947
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,950
this is w okay and we know w plus 2
times h equals 32 right

948
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:52,960
times h equals 32 right
 

949
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,630
times h equals 32 right
we already know that right

950
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
we already know that right
 

951
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,190
we already know that right
and we want to maximize the function y

952
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
and we want to maximize the function y
 

953
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,350
and we want to maximize the function y
equals w times h

954
00:19:59,350 --> 00:19:59,360
equals w times h
 

955
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,470
equals w times h
right so what's w

956
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
right so what's w
 

957
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,310
right so what's w
w equals 32 minus 2 times h i'm right

958
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320
w equals 32 minus 2 times h i'm right
 

959
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,190
w equals 32 minus 2 times h i'm right
yeah

960
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
yeah
 

961
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,990
yeah
w equals 32 minus 2 times x you moving

962
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,000
w equals 32 minus 2 times x you moving
 

963
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,590
w equals 32 minus 2 times x you moving
this term from left side to the right

964
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
this term from left side to the right
 

965
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,230
this term from left side to the right
side you have to

966
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240
side you have to
 

967
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,190
side you have to
neglect the sun right yeah

968
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200

 

969
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,270

okay so y equals 1 y equals this

970
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,280
okay so y equals 1 y equals this
 

971
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,590
okay so y equals 1 y equals this
32 minus 2 times h times h right

972
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
32 minus 2 times h times h right
 

973
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,669
32 minus 2 times h times h right
yeah

974
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
yeah
 

975
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,190
yeah
look at this

976
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
look at this
 

977
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,190
look at this
okay so how what's this

978
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
okay so how what's this
 

979
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,630
okay so how what's this
we can rewrite it as minus 2 h

980
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
we can rewrite it as minus 2 h
 

981
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,590
we can rewrite it as minus 2 h
square

982
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,600
square
 

983
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,310
square
plus 32 h

984
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,320
plus 32 h
 

985
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,789
plus 32 h
all right

986
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799

 

987
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,669

you see

988
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
you see
 

989
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,710
you see
minus 2 we have this minus 2 we take

990
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
minus 2 we have this minus 2 we take
 

991
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,070
minus 2 we have this minus 2 we take
this outside right minus 2h squared

992
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080
this outside right minus 2h squared
 

993
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,029
this outside right minus 2h squared
plus 32 h right all right this is the

994
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
plus 32 h right all right this is the
 

995
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,990
plus 32 h right all right this is the
function

996
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000

 

997
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,909

okay so what's what's it it's a

998
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
okay so what's what's it it's a
 

999
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,149
okay so what's what's it it's a
quadratic equation remember what's

1000
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
quadratic equation remember what's
 

1001
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,710
quadratic equation remember what's
what's the symmetric axis remember

1002
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
what's the symmetric axis remember
 

1003
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,830
what's the symmetric axis remember
what's a

1004
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
what's a
 

1005
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,310
what's a
a equals one

1006
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
a equals one
 

1007
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,549
a equals one
y is one what is one what what's this

1008
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
y is one what is one what what's this
 

1009
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,630
y is one what is one what what's this
two what's b

1010
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
two what's b
 

1011
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,430
two what's b
what's the constant before the linear

1012
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,440
what's the constant before the linear
 

1013
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,870
what's the constant before the linear
term

1014
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
term
 

1015
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,789
term
what's what's there right

1016
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:20,799
what's what's there right
 

1017
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,789
what's what's there right
anyway

1018
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:22,799
anyway
 

1019
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,470
anyway
okay what's c

1020
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480

 

1021
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,029

what's c is there any constant yeah no

1022
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
what's c is there any constant yeah no
 

1023
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,630
what's c is there any constant yeah no
so what's that

1024
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
so what's that
 

1025
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,190
so what's that
okay what's what's his axis

1026
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
okay what's what's his axis
 

1027
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,470
okay what's what's his axis
what's his axis

1028
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480

 

1029
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,190

this one

1030
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200

 

1031
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,590

what's that this value

1032
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
what's that this value
 

1033
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,789
what's that this value
32

1034
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:42,799
32
 

1035
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,710
32
minus

1036
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
minus
 

1037
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,590
minus
one

1038
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:47,600

 

1039
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,870

divided by

1040
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
divided by
 

1041
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,830
divided by
minus

1042
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:49,840
minus
 

1043
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,750
minus
minus four right

1044
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
minus four right
 

1045
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,830
minus four right
so we have

1046
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
so we have
 

1047
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,230
so we have
two times minus two is minus four we

1048
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
two times minus two is minus four we
 

1049
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,590
two times minus two is minus four we
have a negative

1050
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
have a negative
 

1051
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,390
have a negative
double negative makes positive though

1052
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:00,400
double negative makes positive though
 

1053
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,390
double negative makes positive though
so what's a what's

1054
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
so what's a what's
 

1055
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,430
so what's a what's
what's that

1056
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440
what's that
 

1057
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,630
what's that
what's h

1058
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:04,640
what's h
 

1059
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,750
what's h
so h when h equals

1060
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
so h when h equals
 

1061
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,110
so h when h equals
when h equals a we have a maximum value

1062
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
when h equals a we have a maximum value
 

1063
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,190
when h equals a we have a maximum value
am right

1064
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
am right
 

1065
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,909
am right
why is that because a is negative so the

1066
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
why is that because a is negative so the
 

1067
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,029
why is that because a is negative so the
sign

1068
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:17,039
sign
 

1069
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,230
sign
the sun is

1070
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
the sun is
 

1071
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,470
the sun is
like that right something like that

1072
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
like that right something like that
 

1073
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,549
like that right something like that
it's facing down the the

1074
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
it's facing down the the
 

1075
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,070
it's facing down the the
parallel

1076
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
parallel
 

1077
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,669
parallel
facing down

1078
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
facing down
 

1079
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,510
facing down
facing down we have a maximum value

1080
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
facing down we have a maximum value
 

1081
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,270
facing down we have a maximum value
right here correct

1082
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
right here correct
 

1083
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,070
right here correct
and

1084
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
and
 

1085
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,070
and
when is the x h this is h now s equals a

1086
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
when is the x h this is h now s equals a
 

1087
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,950
when is the x h this is h now s equals a
because it's in the symmetric axis right

1088
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
because it's in the symmetric axis right
 

1089
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,310
because it's in the symmetric axis right
good

1090
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
good
 

1091
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,190
good
so h is a we have a maxima so what when

1092
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
so h is a we have a maxima so what when
 

1093
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,750
so h is a we have a maxima so what when
h h is a what's the value of w

1094
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:45,760
h h is a what's the value of w
 

1095
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,470
h h is a what's the value of w
w equals one

1096
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,480
w equals one
 

1097
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,909
w equals one
when h is a

1098
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
when h is a
 

1099
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,390
when h is a
the way what's the value of it

1100
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
the way what's the value of it
 

1101
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,870
the way what's the value of it
two times a 16.

1102
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:54,880
two times a 16.
 

1103
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,270
two times a 16.
16 plus something equals 32 what's the

1104
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
16 plus something equals 32 what's the
 

1105
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,390
16 plus something equals 32 what's the
value of what what's what's the area w

1106
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
value of what what's what's the area w
 

1107
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,590
value of what what's what's the area w
16.

1108
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:01,600
16.
 

1109
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,390
16.
what's his size what's his area

1110
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
what's his size what's his area
 

1111
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,789
what's his size what's his area
w times h what's the area

1112
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
w times h what's the area
 

1113
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,149
w times h what's the area
these two times there 128 right this is

1114
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159
these two times there 128 right this is
 

1115
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,630
these two times there 128 right this is
the answer to the question

1116
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640
the answer to the question
 

1117
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,029
the answer to the question
on your book

1118
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039
on your book
 

1119
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,630
on your book
you see

1120
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,640
you see
 

1121
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,630
you see
it's very cool right

1122
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640
it's very cool right
 

1123
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,230
it's very cool right
instead of listing the value in the

1124
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,240
instead of listing the value in the
 

1125
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,390
instead of listing the value in the
tables one two three four five six seven

1126
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400
tables one two three four five six seven
 

1127
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,149
tables one two three four five six seven
eight until 15.

1128
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
eight until 15.
 

1129
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,070
eight until 15.
i i can calculate

1130
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
i i can calculate
 

1131
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,549
i i can calculate
when h equals eight

1132
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
when h equals eight
 

1133
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,470
when h equals eight
we have the maximum

1134
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:32,480
we have the maximum
 

1135
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,350
we have the maximum
because look this function is that

1136
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
because look this function is that
 

1137
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,470
because look this function is that
yeah so it's facing down when h is

1138
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480
yeah so it's facing down when h is
 

1139
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,630
yeah so it's facing down when h is
eight okay so

1140
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:40,640
eight okay so
 

1141
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,549
eight okay so
yeah when h is a here

1142
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
yeah when h is a here
 

1143
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,430
yeah when h is a here
it has the maximum

1144
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
it has the maximum
 

1145
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,590
it has the maximum
okay

1146
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
okay
 

1147
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,630
okay
uh

1148
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:48,640
uh
 

1149
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,470
uh
any questions so far

1150
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480

 

1151
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,310

no

1152
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320

no no
okay so what have we learned yesterday

1156
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
okay so what have we learned yesterday
 

1157
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,549
okay so what have we learned yesterday
what have we learned today

1158
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:00,559
what have we learned today
 

1159
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:08,230
what have we learned today
to sum up um

1160
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,240

 

1161
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,909

we call it

1162
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
we call it
 

1163
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,830
we call it
we call it y equals a times x times x to

1164
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:13,840
we call it y equals a times x times x to
 

1165
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,549
we call it y equals a times x times x to
the look this is calculated all right

1166
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
the look this is calculated all right
 

1167
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,909
the look this is calculated all right
plus b times x plus c

1168
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:19,919
plus b times x plus c
 

1169
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,510
plus b times x plus c
where a

1170
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:21,520
where a
 

1171
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,630
where a
is not equal to zero yeah if a if a is

1172
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640
is not equal to zero yeah if a if a is
 

1173
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,470
is not equal to zero yeah if a if a is
zero then it's it what's b x plus c

1174
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
zero then it's it what's b x plus c
 

1175
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,850
zero then it's it what's b x plus c
if a is zero what happens

1176
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:33,860

 

1177
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,029

1178
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039

 

1179
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,830

and what's this this is a line

1180
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
and what's this this is a line
 

1181
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,310
and what's this this is a line
this is a line okay

1182
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,320
this is a line okay
 

1183
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,950
this is a line okay
and if a is not equal to zero

1184
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,960
and if a is not equal to zero
 

1185
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,190
and if a is not equal to zero
b c can be zero

1186
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,200
b c can be zero
 

1187
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,590
b c can be zero
so this is a quadratic it's a parabola

1188
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600

 

1189
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,669

right

1190
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:57,679
right
 

1191
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,830
right
and it's a symmetric axis you know

1192
00:24:59,830 --> 00:24:59,840
and it's a symmetric axis you know
 

1193
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,230
and it's a symmetric axis you know
floating when you fold it it's magic

1194
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
floating when you fold it it's magic
 

1195
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,870
floating when you fold it it's magic
axis minus two times a

1196
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
axis minus two times a
 

1197
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,630
axis minus two times a
b right

1198
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,640
b right
 

1199
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,470
b right
and when a

1200
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
and when a
 

1201
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,269
and when a
a is bigger than zero right

1202
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
a is bigger than zero right
 

1203
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,830
a is bigger than zero right
when a is bigger than zero the

1204
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:13,840
when a is bigger than zero the
 

1205
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,029
when a is bigger than zero the
is facing

1206
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
is facing
 

1207
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:20,470
is facing
facing up or facing down

1208
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480

 

1209
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,149

facing out come on facing up with

1210
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:22,159
facing out come on facing up with
 

1211
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,669
facing out come on facing up with
something like when a is smaller than

1212
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:23,679
something like when a is smaller than
 

1213
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,510
something like when a is smaller than
zero

1214
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:25,520
zero
 

1215
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,510
zero
it's the opposite right

1216
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,520
it's the opposite right
 

1217
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,870
it's the opposite right
so when a is bigger than zero

1218
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:30,880
so when a is bigger than zero
 

1219
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,590
so when a is bigger than zero
and when x is at

1220
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
and when x is at
 

1221
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,950
and when x is at
this point when x is this one

1222
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:36,960
this point when x is this one
 

1223
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,110
this point when x is this one
does this paragraph have a maximum or

1224
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
does this paragraph have a maximum or
 

1225
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,110
does this paragraph have a maximum or
minimum value

1226
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120

 

1227
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,110

this one when a is bigger than zero and

1228
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
this one when a is bigger than zero and
 

1229
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,909
this one when a is bigger than zero and
one x is at this point there's symmetric

1230
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:47,919
one x is at this point there's symmetric
 

1231
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,230
one x is at this point there's symmetric
axis so that they have a big a maximum

1232
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
axis so that they have a big a maximum
 

1233
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,870
axis so that they have a big a maximum
value on a minimum a

1234
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:52,880
value on a minimum a
 

1235
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,149
value on a minimum a
max

1236
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:54,159
max
 

1237
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,950
max
this point is maximum minimum come on

1238
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
this point is maximum minimum come on
 

1239
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,630
this point is maximum minimum come on
you look at this all other points are

1240
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
you look at this all other points are
 

1241
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,310
you look at this all other points are
bigger than this this is the lower point

1242
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
bigger than this this is the lower point
 

1243
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,390
bigger than this this is the lower point
so and up how about this when a is

1244
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
so and up how about this when a is
 

1245
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,110
so and up how about this when a is
negative and zero maximum yeah when you

1246
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
negative and zero maximum yeah when you
 

1247
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,870
negative and zero maximum yeah when you
are x at this point you will have

1248
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:06,880
are x at this point you will have
 

1249
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,350
are x at this point you will have
maximum weight right is it that's the

1250
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,360
maximum weight right is it that's the
 

1251
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,190
maximum weight right is it that's the
important takeaway so you can use these

1252
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
important takeaway so you can use these
 

1253
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,190
important takeaway so you can use these
techniques to solve those

1254
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
techniques to solve those
