00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
but we talked about this the merge two
 

19
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,150
but we talked about this the merge two
link list

20
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
link list
 

21
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,589
link list
starting increase like one two

22
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
starting increase like one two
 

23
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,950
starting increase like one two
four and there's two three five

24
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
four and there's two three five
 

25
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,590
four and there's two three five
remember yeah you want to merge these

26
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
remember yeah you want to merge these
 

27
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,549
remember yeah you want to merge these
two assaulted

28
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
two assaulted
 

29
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,470
two assaulted
linked list or this you know if it's the

30
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
linked list or this you know if it's the
 

31
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,709
linked list or this you know if it's the
least it's the same algorithm okay

32
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
least it's the same algorithm okay
 

33
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,150
least it's the same algorithm okay
so look we have we have a

34
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
so look we have we have a
 

35
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,310
so look we have we have a
tummy head this is tummy head so what we

36
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
tummy head this is tummy head so what we
 

37
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,990
tummy head this is tummy head so what we
do

38
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
do
 

39
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,510
do
that means we don't use it for the

40
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
that means we don't use it for the
 

41
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,150
that means we don't use it for the
moment

42
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160

 

43
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,310

okay so now we have two pointers it's

44
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
okay so now we have two pointers it's
 

45
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,430
okay so now we have two pointers it's
one smaller than

46
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
one smaller than
 

47
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,750
one smaller than
two yes so i point i i take these

48
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
two yes so i point i i take these
 

49
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,790
two yes so i point i i take these
put it here okay now

50
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
put it here okay now
 

51
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,710
put it here okay now
it's two smaller than two it doesn't

52
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
it's two smaller than two it doesn't
 

53
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,149
it's two smaller than two it doesn't
matter so i think the two

54
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
matter so i think the two
 

55
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,070
matter so i think the two
so i can link i can take this

56
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080

 

57
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,190

it's two smaller than three yes so i'm

58
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
it's two smaller than three yes so i'm
 

59
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,990
it's two smaller than three yes so i'm
i take this here and put it here yeah

60
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
i take this here and put it here yeah
 

61
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,710
i take this here and put it here yeah
okay

62
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
okay
 

63
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,429
okay
is it sweeter than four other than four

64
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
is it sweeter than four other than four
 

65
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,950
is it sweeter than four other than four
smaller than four yes

66

smaller than four yes
 

67
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,429
smaller than four yes
so i put a three here and i take it off

68
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
so i put a three here and i take it off
 

69
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:23,990
so i put a three here and i take it off
is four

70
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
is four
 

71

00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
smaller than five yes i put a four here
 

73
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,190
smaller than five yes i put a four here
then pop then i need to take the

74
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
then pop then i need to take the
 

75
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,950
then pop then i need to take the
remainder yeah five okay

76
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
remainder yeah five okay
 

77
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,109
remainder yeah five okay
so now this line is assaulted like this

78
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
so now this line is assaulted like this
 

79
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:33,990
so now this line is assaulted like this
yes

80
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
yes
 

81
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,990
yes
okay got it yes the complexity

82
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
okay got it yes the complexity
 

83
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,950
okay got it yes the complexity

00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
oh we can call it o n if n is the number
 

101
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,070
oh we can call it o n if n is the number
of the linked list

102
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
of the linked list
 

103
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,110
of the linked list
in the final sorted

104
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
in the final sorted
 

105
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,229

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
no no n so yeah
 

113
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,229
no no n so yeah
if we have k how can we do it if we have

114
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
if we have k how can we do it if we have
 

115
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,589
if we have k how can we do it if we have
one line can we do it how can we do it

116
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
one line can we do it how can we do it
 

117
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,949
one line can we do it how can we do it
can we look look we can three pointers

118
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
can we look look we can three pointers
 

119
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,229
can we look look we can three pointers
we can merge it one by one right yeah

120
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
we can merge it one by one right yeah
 

121
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,430
we can merge it one by one right yeah
so let's define merge

122
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
so let's define merge
 

123
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,550
so let's define merge
okay list and let's do a list

124
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
okay list and let's do a list
 

125
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,670
okay list and let's do a list
here here is list okay and then

126
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
here here is list okay and then
 

127
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,949
here here is list okay and then
we can do this the answer

128
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
we can do this the answer
 

129
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,190
we can do this the answer
the first first answer is let's do it

130
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200
the first first answer is let's do it
 

131
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,990
the first first answer is let's do it
first answer

132
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
first answer
 

133
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,270
first answer
is okay so now look if length

134
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
is okay so now look if length
 

135
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,869
is okay so now look if length
of the list is dialog

136
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
of the list is dialog
 

137
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,070
of the list is dialog
then we return nothing right right

138
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
then we return nothing right right
 

139
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,309
then we return nothing right right
yeah return the list all nothing it

140
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
yeah return the list all nothing it
 

141
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,229
yeah return the list all nothing it
depends on what you want to return okay

142
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
depends on what you want to return okay
 

143
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,110
depends on what you want to return okay
and now we

144
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
and now we
 

145
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,190
and now we
we can set this answer equals list

146
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
we can set this answer equals list
 

147
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,589
we can set this answer equals list
zero from the first list first link list

148
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
zero from the first list first link list
 

149
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,309
zero from the first list first link list
yes

150
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
yes
 

151
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,670
yes
and then for i in

152
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
and then for i in
 

153
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,670
and then for i in
rent one start from one to

154
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
rent one start from one to
 

155
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,509
rent one start from one to
lens list yeah and then

156
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
lens list yeah and then
 

157
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,550
lens list yeah and then
we can say answer equals

158
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
we can say answer equals
 

159
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,830
we can say answer equals
much

160
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840

 

161
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,869

162
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
answer list
 

163
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,550
answer list
i right yeah we are actually merging

164
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
i right yeah we are actually merging
 

165
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,630
i right yeah we are actually merging
these this one by one yeah

166
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
these this one by one yeah
 

167
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,070
these this one by one yeah
and then return what return

168
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
and then return what return
 

169
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,830
and then return what return
match the answer yeah so basically we

170
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
match the answer yeah so basically we
 

171
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,149
match the answer yeah so basically we
have

172
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
have
 

173
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,309
have
filtering we have a list of linked lists

174
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
filtering we have a list of linked lists
 

175
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,309
filtering we have a list of linked lists
yes we have a list of languages and then

176
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
yes we have a list of languages and then
 

177
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:06,630
yes we have a list of languages and then
we

178
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
we
 

179
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,390
we
we take the first one we mulch it to the

180
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
we take the first one we mulch it to the
 

181
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,990
we take the first one we mulch it to the
second one and we must keep merging

182
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
second one and we must keep merging
 

183
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,550
second one and we must keep merging
until

184
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
until
 

185
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,430
until
all of it yeah what's the complexity

186
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:16,440

198
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
yeah merging each one takes n
 

199
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,270
yeah merging each one takes n
for complexities are okay and okay so

200
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
for complexities are okay and okay so
 

201
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,909
for complexities are okay and okay so
can we

202
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
can we
 

203
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,749
can we
can we do you see in a way

204
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759

 

205
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,790

how about you look if these are if there

206
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
how about you look if these are if there
 

207
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,830
how about you look if these are if there
are like a list

208
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
are like a list
 

209
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,830
are like a list
yeah if i can look like like

210
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
yeah if i can look like like
 

211
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,590
yeah if i can look like like
list like this there if therefore okay

212
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
list like this there if therefore okay

they look like lollipops
look can we can we merge these four

222
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
look can we can we merge these four
 

223
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,590
look can we can we merge these four
divide it into half small to these four

224
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
divide it into half small to these four
 

225
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,870
divide it into half small to these four
and model these four yeah

226
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
and model these four yeah
 

227
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,950
and model these four yeah
yeah and for this four i can merge this

228
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
yeah and for this four i can merge this
 

229
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,790
yeah and for this four i can merge this
for two and only these two

230
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
for two and only these two
 

231
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,790
for two and only these two
and here we know it's number of two then

232
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
and here we know it's number of two then
 

233
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,990
and here we know it's number of two then
we can merge it

234
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
we can merge it
 

235
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,870
we can merge it
do we get it so so we divide it into

236
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
do we get it so so we divide it into
 

237
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,150
do we get it so so we divide it into
half

238
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
half
 

239
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,310
half
and then we every time we merge much

240
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
and then we every time we merge much
 

241
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,230
and then we every time we merge much
keep merging and there is smaller one

242
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
keep merging and there is smaller one
 

243
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,990
keep merging and there is smaller one
and here we know okay so how can we do

244
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
and here we know okay so how can we do
 

245
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,230
and here we know okay so how can we do
this look

246
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
and then right and we want to merge
 

347
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,029
and then right and we want to merge
another half

348
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039

this meat meat and column yeah

352
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
this meat meat and column yeah
 

353
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,230
this meat meat and column yeah
that's that so that basically you have

354
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
that's that so that basically you have
 

355
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,990
that's that so that basically you have
you know the meat here yeah this is the

356
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
you know the meat here yeah this is the
 

357
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,430
you know the meat here yeah this is the
meat yeah

358
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
meat yeah
 

359
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,869
meat yeah
and you want to imagine it is calling

360
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
and you want to imagine it is calling
 

361
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,710
and you want to imagine it is calling
itself to merge this path and calling

362
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
itself to merge this path and calling
 

363
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,469
itself to merge this path and calling
itself the merchant of this half

itself the merchant of this half
 

365
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,309
itself the merchant of this half
that's why it does wherever and then we

366
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
that's why it does wherever and then we
 

367
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,230
that's why it does wherever and then we
have the left here

368
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
have the left here
 

369
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,029
have the left here
and we have the uh right here so what

370
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
and we have the uh right here so what
 

371
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,189
and we have the uh right here so what
should we do now the last last sentence

372
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
should we do now the last last sentence
 

373
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:24,950
should we do now the last last sentence
return what

374
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960

 

375
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,309

much left left last one

376
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
much left left last one
 

377
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,589
much left left last one
yes left between and what

378
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
yes left between and what
 

379
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,790
yes left between and what
left left and right yeah yeah

380
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
left left and right yeah yeah
 

381
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,230
left left and right yeah yeah
you see it makes sense yeah yeah so we

382
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
you see it makes sense yeah yeah so we
 

383
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,870
you see it makes sense yeah yeah so we
because you're dividing into two how to

384
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
because you're dividing into two how to
 

385
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,829
because you're dividing into two how to
list

386
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
list
 

387
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,870
list
and then we're calling itself to

388
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
and then we're calling itself to
 

389
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,030
and then we're calling itself to
deal with a smaller problem right and

390
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
deal with a smaller problem right and
 

391
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,990
deal with a smaller problem right and
here

392
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
here
 

393
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,070
here
the length is zero one or two then we

394
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
the length is zero one or two then we
 

395
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,590
the length is zero one or two then we
know how to deal with it

396
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
know how to deal with it
 

397
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,829
know how to deal with it
and after we get this left and right in

398
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:53,839
and after we get this left and right in
 

399
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,829
and after we get this left and right in
english then how can we merge it

400
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
english then how can we merge it
 

401
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,389
english then how can we merge it
we know how can we how we can merge it

402
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
we know how can we how we can merge it
 

403
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,170
we know how can we how we can merge it
the complexity

404
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:01,180
the complexity
 

405
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,710
the complexity
[Music]

406
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
[Music]
 

407
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,790
[Music]
okay

408
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800

 

409
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,870

okay it's the okay and why is it still

410
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
okay it's the okay and why is it still
 

411
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,990
okay it's the okay and why is it still
okay because

412
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
okay because
 

413
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,949
okay because
it also needs the k times look look if

414
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
it also needs the k times look look if
 

415
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,630
it also needs the k times look look if
like i have one two three four

416
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
like i have one two three four
 

417
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,310
like i have one two three four
five six let's say i want to

418
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
five six let's say i want to
 

419
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,949
five six let's say i want to
oh how many times i need to merge look i

420
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
oh how many times i need to merge look i
 

421
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,470
oh how many times i need to merge look i
tell you look

422
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
tell you look
 

423
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,030
tell you look
maybe seven eight okay now that at least

424
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
maybe seven eight okay now that at least
 

425
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,910
maybe seven eight okay now that at least
how how many

426
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
how how many
 

427
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,949
how how many
times we want to merge three

428
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
times we want to merge three
 

429
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,509
times we want to merge three
one time two times three times four

430
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
one time two times three times four
 

431
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,949
one time two times three times four
times yeah

432
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
times yeah
 

433
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,949
times yeah
five times six times seven times

434
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
five times six times seven times
 

435
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,310
five times six times seven times
you see it's actually k minus one time

436
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
you see it's actually k minus one time
 

437
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,590
you see it's actually k minus one time
do you get it

438
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
do you get it
 

439
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,389
do you get it
yeah even we divide it into two but

440
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
yeah even we divide it into two but
 

441
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,670
yeah even we divide it into two but
still we need to

442
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
still we need to
 

443
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,310
still we need to
merge these ones yeah merge these ones

444
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
merge these ones yeah merge these ones
 

445
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,430
merge these ones yeah merge these ones
yeah

446
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
yeah
 

447
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,670
yeah
and merge these two ones much less one

448
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
and merge these two ones much less one
 

449
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,590
and merge these two ones much less one
more this one much less one and the

450
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
more this one much less one and the
 

451
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,310
more this one much less one and the
multi ones

452
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
multi ones
 

453
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,269
multi ones
and i think we get at least that so it's

454
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
and i think we get at least that so it's
 

455
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,070
and i think we get at least that so it's
still

456
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
still
 

457
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,269
still
even it looks like you divide into two

458
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
even it looks like you divide into two
 

459
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,829
even it looks like you divide into two
but still you need k times k minus one

460
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
but still you need k times k minus one
 

461
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,590
but still you need k times k minus one
time but we drop the constant so it's

462
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
time but we drop the constant so it's
 

463
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,550
time but we drop the constant so it's
okay

464
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
okay
 

465
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,310
okay
yeah okay yes why is that because we

466
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
yeah okay yes why is that because we
 

467
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,069
yeah okay yes why is that because we
need to merge the k list

468
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
need to merge the k list
 

469
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,030
need to merge the k list
it's not like divide it's not like the

470
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
it's not like divide it's not like the
 

471
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,670
it's not like divide it's not like the
log and

472
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
log and
 

473
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,590
log and
binary search what will we divide it

474
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
binary search what will we divide it
 

475
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,030
binary search what will we divide it
know how we don't need to consider the

476
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
know how we don't need to consider the
 

477
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,310
know how we don't need to consider the
other half right

478
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
other half right
 

479
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,630
other half right
yes we make we click a number and always

480
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
yes we make we click a number and always
 

481
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,069
yes we make we click a number and always
we divide into

482
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
we divide into
 

483
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,509
we divide into
let in that case the complexity is what

484
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
let in that case the complexity is what
 

485
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,590
let in that case the complexity is what
again yeah we are done okay do you make

486
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
again yeah we are done okay do you make
 

487
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,430
again yeah we are done okay do you make
sense yeah does it make sense

488
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
sense yeah does it make sense
 

489
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,949
sense yeah does it make sense
yeah so today can you sum up what's

490
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
yeah so today can you sum up what's
 

491
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,389
yeah so today can you sum up what's
what have you learned today just one

492
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
what have you learned today just one
 

493
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,870
what have you learned today just one
sentence another people

494
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
sentence another people
 

495
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,829
sentence another people
in the world know okay can you tell me

496
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
in the world know okay can you tell me
 

497
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,230
in the world know okay can you tell me
about

498
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
about
 

499
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,310
about
magically okay salty list yes yes

500
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
magically okay salty list yes yes
 

501
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,949
magically okay salty list yes yes
and what is right eric can you tell can

502
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
and what is right eric can you tell can
 

503
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,230
and what is right eric can you tell can
you tell people what have you learned

504
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
you tell people what have you learned
 

505
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,069
you tell people what have you learned
today

506
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079

 

507
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,069

how many saltines

508
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079

 

509
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,590

what's the function name this bit

510
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
what's the function name this bit
 

511
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,710
what's the function name this bit
yeah merge k sorted list list has to be

512
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
yeah merge k sorted list list has to be
 

513
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,790
yeah merge k sorted list list has to be
merged yeah we land the merge two sorted

514
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
merged yeah we land the merge two sorted
 

515
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,790
merged yeah we land the merge two sorted
list and we apply this to neg

516
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
list and we apply this to neg
 

517
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,829
list and we apply this to neg
technique to merge cases what's the

518
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839
technique to merge cases what's the
 

519
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:21,710
technique to merge cases what's the
complexity

520
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:21,720

 

521
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,720

okay
