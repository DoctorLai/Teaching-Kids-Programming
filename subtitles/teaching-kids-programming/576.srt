1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
right

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,460
okay so today

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,679
let's look at these simple questions we

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,200
are given an integer right four three

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,039
seven five positive integer non-negative

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,340
integer and we want to find out the

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,820
minimum sum of splitting it into two

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,880
non-negative integers so we achieve the

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,220
minimum sum so using these digits we

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,380
want to split into two

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,100
number one

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,399
and number two these are non-negative

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,600
numbers which can contain

14
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,059
ddlers we want to find out the minimum

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,800
sum of number one plus them two okay so

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,300
for example this one how many ways can

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,300
you split into two integers

18
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:55,800
you can split 47 and 75 you place it

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:01:00,020
together that's 118 right you can split

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,800
into four three seven and five number

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,400
right

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:10,860
this adds up to four four two way you

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:14,100
can split into 35 Plus 47 these

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,540
is 82. okay so we want to find out the

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,439
minimum okay

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:23,040
so yeah yeah the minimum sum so for

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,560
example the minimum sum I guess is 30.

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,240
is it thirty five okay you already done

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,730
that that's the minimum yeah is it the

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,040
minimum

31
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,299
[Music]

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:38,420
let's try a few other examples like

33
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:43,380
75 no I always down like that 74 plus 53

34
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:47,880
equals 127. okay so any idea how we get

35
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,700
this minimum so so there's two things

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,680
so we can so we want the minimum so

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,740
we're not obviously not gonna have a

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,619
three digit plus a one digit so we got a

39
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,079
two two digit and two digit so if we

40
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,659
want to find the smallest tens and and

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,719
then we can leave a bigger digits to

42
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,459
develop uh ones yeah that's a very good

43
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,380
thinking so how about you say the two

44
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,360
and two how about three digits like one

45
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,239
two three what's the minimum

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,040
you can't split evenly right but in this

47
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,900
case what's the minimum you can speak

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,000
one two plus three you can speak one

49
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,819
three plus two this is

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,940
okay you can speed with two three plus

51
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:32,760
one or two one plus three

52
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:36,900
this is first 15 this goes the 24.

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,580
I obviously this is the minimum so for

54
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,300
the minimum

55
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,300
Digi you uh put it as like the biggest

56
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:49,440
place value so you can put like

57
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,019
the tens so when you put one on tens

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,280
okay so what's your schedule you said

59
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,280
Put it on Wednesday put

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,569
[Music]

61
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,879
will be the minimum one

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,580
the

63
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,580
[Music]

64
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:32,519
two so we put it into five five I'm not

65
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,099
saying one two three

66
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,860
um I'm saying wait can we put the zero

67
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:43,400
in at the front of course yes so so we

68
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,400
put zero and one and yes

69
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,720
two three like

70
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,720
uh-huh okay

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,340
yeah okay okay so this is the optimal

72
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,280
yes you're right yes so we always keep

73
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,319
the smallest smallest and the biggest

74
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,959
number is going at the end that's right

75
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,239
so one at a time right another and it

76
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,000
doesn't matter if there's a odd number

77
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,400
so we just have one more extra for one

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,160
application because because the bigger

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,919
digits if you put the biggest they get

80
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,780
it as like the ones in the ones place

81
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,139
the first three is like eight and nine

82
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,479
it'll be as as less value if it if you

83
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:30,240
could have a like front like well done

84
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,100
okay so for any arbitrary Lumber right a

85
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,840
big number what's your strategy the

86
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,820
first step you need to tell me how we

87
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,360
designed this algorithm right so first

88
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,360
step is

89
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,220
so what do we do with this okay

90
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,540
I don't know so for this digit how would

91
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,740
you do it

92
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,740
so first step is

93
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,360
salty that's the thing I'm looking for

94
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,780
keywords sort it so we sold it so let's

95
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:09,540
zero zero one two two three six seven

96
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,919
eight nine nine right okay and then we

97
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,560
started what's next

98
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:18,120
and then and then we put the first two

99
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,580
the first two yeah as as the first to

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,380
get as a this is the first digit uh

101
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,000
first digit this is the second digit

102
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,800
second number okay so so

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,660
how we describe this process

104
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,940
zero or one

105
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,180
one

106
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,180
two two

107
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,699
[Music]

108
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:43,199
three

109
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:44,940
six seven eight nine nine suppose I have

110
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
another nine here I just can just put it

111
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,680
there yeah it doesn't matter doesn't

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,860
matter put it here out here no actually

113
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,500
it matters right yeah so yeah we want to

114
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,960
put it here right so we always pick in

115
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,520
turn there are a couple ways of solving

116
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,380
these questions all right so today we're

117
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,000
just going to one and the next one we

118
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,900
talk about the second solution and the

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,900
next lesson nine on the

120
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:12,240
if it's old and you have one spare

121
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,440
when it's bad do you put it on the

122
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,259
smallest

123
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,180
we just take in ten right because the

124
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,680
first number is always we pick this

125
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,039
number this is the smallest right yes

126
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,039
yes

127
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,360
remember that's right yes we just take

128
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,660
digit in turn right take it in turn

129
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,400
right make sense and then okay so as I

130
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,400
said there are a couple ways of doing

131
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,660
this okay the first way is sorting the

132
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,759
digit

133
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,740
sorted the digit right

134
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
the second way is we use the package

135
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,880
stop we should we are going to talk

136
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,759
about like sorting why we can use the

137
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,340
bakkie stop remember we have a limited

138
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,460
digit right that only 10 buckets all

139
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,460
right

140
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,139
you can imagine there are 10 buckets

141
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,300
yellow this is color number zero one two

142
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,759
right so we go through this number and

143
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,139
we count how many digits of zero how

144
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,000
many this is the one right okay we'll

145
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,860
talk about that in the next lesson the

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,520
Third Way is using the parallel Cube or

147
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:21,000
hip right so the idea is that we peel

148
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,120
the hip and particle right every time we

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,460
take a digit the next smallest digit

150
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,800
for the first number and the next model

151
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,800
digit if there is for the second number

152
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,840
and we take these digits internal okay

153
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,860
but today we focus on this sorting the

154
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,080
digit

155
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,680
so it's actually quite simple right so

156
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,680
let's give a digit is uh individual time

157
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,960
right so minimum sum

158
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,419
so we're given this n which is the

159
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,940
integer type and we want to return the

160
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:53,460
integer the minimum sum I

161
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,340
okay so this is the integer why we want

162
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,900
to get that digit so it's we want to

163
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,380
solve the digit so we convert it to a

164
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,840
string right okay so Str converted the

165
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,539
string but we want to

166
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,300
sort it right converting a string how do

167
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:12,660
we saw that string

168
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:16,500
string is immutable right so we can

169
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:20,940
ah we can convert it to an array of

170
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:24,720
digits right and then we sort it

171
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,620
sort it so this is a

172
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,560
okay

173
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,919
so after this what's a look if this is

174
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,560
one two three okay str123

175
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,640
back to the code to make it string type

176
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,880
least

177
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,320
if we do like this three it will be one

178
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,940
two

179
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,039
three right

180
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,980
array of teaching and sort it it's

181
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:50,100
already insulted so after that we want

182
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:53,339
to pick in turn right so look one

183
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,200
two three four five six seven so for the

184
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:59,399
first number for the first number we

185
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,279
want to pick these these this this life

186
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:04,500
for the second number we want to take

187
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,360
this this okay

188
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,580
[Music]

189
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,720
and then it plays the a here I want to

190
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,519
pick here right

191
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,540
so how do we put it this way so the

192
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,320
first number

193
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,880
S1 equals a is least right so we want to

194
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,000
do this a

195
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,440
dash dash two jumped

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,959
step two right

197
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,060
this is a list we want to convert it to

198
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,040
uh convert it to a string and then

199
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,360
convert it to an integer so how do we

200
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,300
convert a

201
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,700
array to a string

202
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,399
split what's the opposite of split join

203
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,740
yeah we want to join with empty join

204
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,600
and then now this is a string and I will

205
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,839
convert it to the integer right

206
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,100
okay and then S2 equals in this is the

207
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,440
same

208
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,540
The Joy but there's a slight difference

209
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,420
a

210
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,880
Bata two what should I put here

211
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,279
what should I put here

212
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,680
one way you don't put anything here this

213
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,779
is zero but for the second number we

214
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,540
want to start from yes one exactly we're

215
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:10,380
done okay and that's it no no yeah

216
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:13,019
actually 10 S1 plus s2y this is the

217
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,060
minimum so this is called the python the

218
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,100
least comprehension so for at least

219
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,760
right interval you can entice and you

220
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:25,200
can do listen this is the least one you

221
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:28,260
can do I column J column k

222
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:33,000
so it means that from I to J not

223
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:36,060
including the J step K when I is omitted

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,820
is equal to zero When J is emitted is

225
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,580
default to length of the a when K is

226
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,040
omitting is defaulted to one column

227
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,899
column minus one what does it mean

228
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,380
reverse so it's the same as look it's

229
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,380
the same as

230
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,420
which is if this is a and then minus one

231
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,399
okay so it means that from left to the

232
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,220
right but I want to step minus one going

233
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,920
backwards so let's reverse

234
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,579
okay so the time complexity for this one

235
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:12,420
right if there are n digits if this is n

236
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:15,540
digit uh Pick N digit then we obviously

237
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,920
we need to solve it so o and log begin

238
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,420
okay

239
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,420
okay so what have you learned today

240
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,040
about a thousand splitting

241
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,959
minimum what number sum okay so what's

242
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,600
your strategy today what's the algorithm

243
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:37,700
we talked about today

244
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:41,459
yeah so we thought it so what what

245
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,260
do you call it a number the number the

246
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,060
digits right the digit of these numbers

247
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,920
and we need to First convert it to a

248
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,060
string right we started the string right

249
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,519
yeah

250
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,040
and then what's the strategy of picking

251
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,519
them

252
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:59,220
into spaces yeah so we take the digit

253
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,380
for two numbers we take the digit uh the

254
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,860
smaller digit in term right we construct

255
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:08,339
the smallest number we take turn to take

256
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,540
the digit and right yes okay that's it

257
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,540
for today bye

258
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,540
bye
