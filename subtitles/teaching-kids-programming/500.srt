1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,279
and waited

2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,640
and waited because the cost between

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,199
vertex

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
is the same right if i put the numbers

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,880
here like one two then let's weight it

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,039
right because the cost

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,560
from zero to three is one from three to

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
four is two

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,680
you can treat it and weight it as the

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,719
cross between the vertex is all one even

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,200
as the edge okay the given is directed

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,600
and weighted graph also given a list of

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,480
the star and stops for example like two

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,800
four one three okay what's the sum

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,480
of the shortest paths

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,559
between all the pairs for example like

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,600
two and four the shortest path between

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,199
two and four

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,039
look two to go to zero three and four

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,879
that's the only one that's only where

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,359
distance is three right because three

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,400
hops one two three okay

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,640
three

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
plus one two three

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,960
one

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,840
two three another three if i add another

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,960
edge then you'll take this edge instead

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,439
so that'll be one got it

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,400
yeah if there's no such uh

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,439
path right so for example if one

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,960
cannot go to five right if i put a one

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
to five

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,640
if one there's no path between one to

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,159
five and we turn zero that's zero okay

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,479
because

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,479
yeah yeah it's it's not connected right

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,520
even it's connected sometimes there's no

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,040
path because it's directed so look one

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,560
two two

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,520
and then

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,399
uh three so there's no path between one

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,399
to three right

43
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,159
can

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,159
canvas

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,799
if there is no path so this bit the cost

46
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,040
would be the distance would be zero so

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,360
we just need to sum up it but

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,360
pretty simple just consider this graph

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,080
directly anointed graph we want to find

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,560
out the shortest path between

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,879
any two vertex so what kind of algorithm

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,800
comes to your mind

53
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,640
um breakfast

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,040
breakfast search yes staff assessing may

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,400
work but you need to explore all the

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,080
paths that's not very efficient remember

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,120
we also talked about the iterative

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,959
deepening

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,400
iterative difference

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,920
such meaning that when we set the max

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,319
mass steps equals to one and uh we do

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,840
this dfs and we stop and match that's

63
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,519
one and now we increment the math steps

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
to two right and then we do this

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,200
definite search and the definition will

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,080
stop when

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,440
the distance is it sees the mass step

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,840
okay so that's the way of using the

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,319
depth search in iterative deepening

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,800
search to find out the shortest distance

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,560
between two vertex right okay but

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,200
breakfast search is more straightforward

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,040
right because it's directed

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,280
and weighted because the thing is

75
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,440
unweighted if it's unweighted it means

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,519
that we can use the breakfast right but

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,680
if it's weighted

78
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,440
then we can't use the preferences if

79
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,840
it's weighted we probably need to use

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,760
the uniform because she has a uniform

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,640
concealer should we talk about that

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,560
yeah

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,200
this truck

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,840
okay we will talk about that all right

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
thick strap and then

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,040
floyd we talked about that yesterday

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,599
remember we mentioned that

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,319
floyd what's up okay the

89
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,959
most important thing about this a floyd

90
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,000
warsaw agreement is that it's a dynamic

91
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,040
programming

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,319
so

93
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,640
remember we talked about this i to j

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,680
we want to calculate the shortest path

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,519
between i to j and at some point we find

96
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,480
the k vertex

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,720
and then we find out that i

98
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,000
distance i to k

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,680
plus distance k to j

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,280
is smaller than distance i took i to j

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,120
so what does it mean look

102
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,680
we want to find a distance shortest

103
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,799
distance between i to j and then somehow

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,880
we find out that i to k plus k to j is

105
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,959
shorter right don't look at this

106
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,120
triangle triangle

107
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,199
any triangle

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,320
we have the sum of any two sides is

109
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,160
bigger than

110
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,120
the third one right yeah for any

111
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,040
triangle look any triangle any two sides

112
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,040
the sum of any two sides is bigger than

113
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,759
the other side i'm right look any two

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,400
sides the sum of triangles any time

115
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,280
the sum of two sides is bigger

116
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,680
a b plus ac is bigger than bc it cannot

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,600
be smaller than bc right because the

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
distance the shortest distance between

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,199
two points two point a and b the

120
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,199
shortest distance the stroke is

121
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,960
different between a and b can you find

122
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,759
the path that

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,680
connects a and b and it's the shortest

124
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,360
a straight line a straight line yes

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,720
perfect a straight line so this is the

126
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,960
shortest right and this c is somehow you

127
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,320
know not always a b to make it a

128
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,800
triangle right

129
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,240
you just say this is the shortest so ac

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,560
plus cb must be bigger than a b am right

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,840
what is c

132
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,080
if you see it's there that's a good

133
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,600
question then it's not a finger it's a

134
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,919
straight line

135
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,680
but here this is not triangle right what

136
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,560
i'm saying is that the cost between i

137
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
and j

138
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,320
right we can find the shorter path by

139
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,360
jumping to k so i plus k that cost maybe

140
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,639
look

141
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
a hundred

142
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,120
now

143
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,919
it takes a from to travel from i to j

144
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,759
the cost to travel from i to k is 50 and

145
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,080
k to j is 20.

146
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,080
so which one is shorter from i to j

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,960
yeah you take this yeah because look 50

148
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,160
plus 20 is smaller than 100 right this

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,919
is what it means

150
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,240
yeah yeah yeah but so yeah i've got this

151
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,080
supposed to be shorter no no no don't

152
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,919
confuse with it i'm saying this is not a

153
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,560
triangle this is you know yeah but

154
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,160
that's not that's shorter but and this

155
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,199
is longer

156
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,520
but

157
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,960
but this one these profits should be

158
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,280
considered

159
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,039
yeah yeah consider traffic

160
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,039
can see the traffic look um

161
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,280
[Music]

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,639
20 is not the same as 50 though

163
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,440
yeah but

164
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,039
these are basically the damn same thing

165
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,199
yeah just let's say

166
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,080
i'm saying look it take a take 100

167
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,160
minutes

168
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,360
if we go the straight way to london

169
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,280
right but you might travel to i know i

170
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,600
don't know maybe what's this what's the

171
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,000
city you know island kimberjee and

172
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
london

173
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,440
edinburgh

174
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,870
okay okay this is the edinburgh okay

175
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,319
anyway so look

176
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,479
[Music]

177
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,680
with the cambridge

178
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,319
dude

179
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,160
but it's so much longer than london oh

180
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,680
something like but

181
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,560
in tokyo

182
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,880
fine tokyo

183
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,880
okay

184
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,840
and besides tokyo is not even in united

185
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,120
kingdom yeah it could be something like

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,919
liverpool or liverpool okay so cambridge

187
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,400
we want to travel to

188
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,560
manchester okay manchester

189
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,639
all right so if we directly travel to

190
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,479
manchester yeah it's 100 minutes but now

191
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,039
i'm telling you it's not manchester

192
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,319
united

193
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,639
it can be each

194
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,240
maybe 15 minutes like 80 watts of

195
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,520
manchester 20

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,520
[Music]

197
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
to minutes

198
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,199
you could change engine bro

199
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,240
like something like that

200
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,560
what's the

201
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,280
name any city between cambodia and

202
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,280
manchester um

203
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,599
uh i but i thought liverpool was a

204
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,039
football team no liverpool well the

205
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,879
liverpool play and and there is

206
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,720
uh

207
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,759
sheffield

208
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,080
yeah

209
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,080
okay cool

210
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,640
okay but anyway coming back to this the

211
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,039
core idea of this uh flowing water

212
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,440
shortest part is that we can replace the

213
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,039
distance with the shorter one if we find

214
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,760
a third vertex i plus kj is smaller than

215
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,160
i j okay so at least this aggregate

216
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,120
provides us this uh o and

217
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,440
o and qp or ov cubic n is the number of

218
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,640
vertex right but it's a multi-source

219
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,959
shortest

220
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,959
path

221
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,560
means that if we perform this aggregate

222
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:08,000
we can find any pair is too far away any

223
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,720
pairs distance b i b j we can find the

224
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,640
shortest path between vertex i and

225
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,399
vertex j okay so

226
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,720
we talked about this we infinitely say

227
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,720
yesterday so we just need to uh

228
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,440
implement this again

229
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,440
so we are given this graph is a adjacent

230
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,440
list okay attraction list what

231
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,959
suggestion is look one

232
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,399
two two

233
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,800
one two three

234
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,519
and one to four and the adjacent is

235
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,399
instead dictionary right so look one

236
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,000
energy three yeah one

237
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,680
uh maybe two two three here the one is

238
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,279
has the

239
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,360
vertex edges two two three four five

240
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,160
so look at the key inside the vertex the

241
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,440
values is the list of vertex that it has

242
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,440
connected to

243
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,160
right and then vertex two connects to

244
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,040
three okay so what that's what it is and

245
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,120
we want to convert it to adjacent metric

246
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,800
adjacent matrix adjacently if we want to

247
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,760
convert it to adjacent measurement with

248
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,079
this accurate we need to assess this dij

249
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,160
the cost right so it's better we convert

250
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,640
it to addition magic right so we're

251
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,160
using these two dimensional array two

252
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,959
dimensional array to to store the cost

253
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,360
between vertex i and vertex string so we

254
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,320
given this and we know this n vertex

255
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,000
here and

256
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
vertex

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,760
this is the rotation list then we need

258
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:34,320
to convert it to these adjacent metric

259
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,440
so if gl is i equal equal j

260
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,959
ers

261
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,839
infinity

262
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,720
for

263
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,800
i

264
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,600
in range

265
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,560
and n is the number of vertex right then

266
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,200
for

267
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,360
j in range

268
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
n

269
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,519
okay

270
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,720
so adjacent list we convert it to

271
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:00,079
adjacent matrix so it's like zero uh

272
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:04,000
you know one zero zero one zero zero

273
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,839
zero one zero zero uh zero zero one one

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,920
zero one

275
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,480
like something like that right something

276
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,880
like this it's a magic and the diagonal

277
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,600
the value on the diagonal is all one

278
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,880
because because when we consider the

279
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,600
vertex i can travel to vertex i okay

280
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,120
right so for example like this value

281
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,880
this value is zero one two three

282
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,880
this way we want to access this value

283
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,320
this value is d

284
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,880
row 3

285
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,200
column 0 1 2 right so it means that

286
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,480
there's a path between 3 the vertex 3 to

287
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,880
vertex 2 so vertex 3 to vertex 2.

288
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,640
okay and how about this one this is

289
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,000
this is d

290
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,920
zero

291
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,680
three right

292
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,160
zero one two three so it means that

293
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,720
there's a path between gl to three

294
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,399
okay so this is d d is the adjacent

295
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,480
matrix we're converting the adjacent

296
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,399
list to adjacent matrix four

297
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,399
k in range n

298
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,360
for

299
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,360
i in range n

300
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,040
for

301
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,680
j in range n

302
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:16,800
d i j

303
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:20,720
is minimum of t i j

304
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,720
and d i k

305
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,160
plus d k

306
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,040
j okay let me draw again i

307
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,279
j

308
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,440
and we have a k here right

309
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,440
so

310
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,760
if we find out

311
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,240
i to k plus k to j smaller than i to j

312
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,959
then we replace the shortest path d i j

313
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,920
with d i k plus k i j that's what it

314
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,839
means great very simple

315
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,320
very simple idea the time conduction if

316
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,880
you look at this

317
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,959
o and q b right we talked about the

318
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,000
product yeah cartesian product yesterday

319
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,880
remember we can replace this with one

320
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,920
for k i j

321
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,480
in

322
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,480
product

323
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,279
range

324
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,040
and

325
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,639
repeat

326
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,639
equals three okay so range end

327
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,399
cartesian product is by itself three

328
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,519
times and then we get this topper kij

329
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,200
which serves the purpose of this one

330
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
okay and then we want to calculate the

331
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,399
sum of these return

332
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,279
sum

333
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,240
d

334
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,320
i

335
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,320
j

336
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,440
if d i j right if d i j not equals to

337
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,120
infinity

338
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,120
if there is a task otherwise

339
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:45,440
s 0 and 4 i j in

340
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,440
in i don't know in array okay

341
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,040
and i'll be what have you learned today

342
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,160
given a

343
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,000
directive

344
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,720
a direct unweighted graph we want to

345
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,199
find out the shortest path the idea of

346
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,040
this agreement is that

347
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,760
it's based on dynamic programming so we

348
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,120
want to program okay listen

349
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,720
just listen

350
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,959
d i j

351
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,600
is the value of the shortest path

352
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,920
between vertex i to vertex 3. so

353
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,480
we want to calculate the shortest path

354
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,560
between i to j the cost and at any point

355
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,279
if you find the vertice k and then we

356
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,240
find out that i to k the shortest path

357
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,160
the the cost between i to k and plus i k

358
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,440
to j is shorter than i suggest and we

359
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:31,720
can replace this bit with i plus k k

360
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,720
plus j okay so anyway

361
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,079
you can replace the

362
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,120
that

363
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,120
distance between r to j with r to the j

364
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,160
it but anyway can you summarizing using

365
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,399
our let's ryan did a good job now your

366
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,120
turn

367
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,320
okay so you find out the cost

368
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,160
yeah we want to find out the cost

369
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,519
between adjacent

370
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:19,440
so i took a plus k k k today uh e if

371
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,399
it's uh what uh becoming bigger i just i

372
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,600
plus

373
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,240
i to k

374
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,040
plus i okay

375
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,000
uh

376
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,839
this is it

377
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,839
yeah we also basically we want to find

378
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,320
out the minimum yeah okay

379
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,639
the minimum of these parts i to j and i

380
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,720
take a to j okay so for example in a

381
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,120
later we have another t

382
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,320
right i to t t to j

383
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,839
so we can

384
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,430
get these parts instead okay 100 yeah

385
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,759
yeah

386
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,720
[Music]

387
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,279
yeah yeah exactly let's that's it okay

388
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,440
the time for next o n q the space

389
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,480
complexity

390
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,199
r n square right because we're using the

391
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,279
adjacent matrix to store dehydrated

392
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,519
shortest paths between

393
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,800
any pairs the this is a multi-source

394
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,880
shortest task

395
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,040
d i j so it means the shortest path

396
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,160
between vertices i and vertex 3

397
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,160
okay that will be it for today bye-bye
