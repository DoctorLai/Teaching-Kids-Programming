1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,120
yes

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,920
and you mentioned what's title Circle

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,460
decorations like the wheels on the bus

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,460
go round

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:27,859
he said we all know the and we like put

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,340
the milk powder I'll I'll

7
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:33,719
smile look at this one

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,840
out though we learned you to call them

9
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,120
one two one two three okay so in eat a

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,360
two US python provides this eater to us

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:47,700
it has a one cycle function okay so what

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,700
does it do g equals psycho

13
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,660
one two three yeah and then I can do

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,840
this why uh two

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:02,600
wire two means that in definitely do

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,600
enter this Loop and I can say point

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,539
next

18
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,200
G

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,700
okay so guess what happened after

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,119
executing this piece of code three line

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,400
okay what happened LD operate one two

22
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,060
three one two three one two three four

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,000
two three yes exactly look g equals

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,640
cycle you know a parameter one two three

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,860
and Y true white room is integration

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,500
Point keep going so basically this is

27
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,979
the busy dupe uh keep going it never

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,680
ends next G because G is an iterator

29
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,280
next move to the next year next will be

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,920
one next will be two three and then

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,960
you go back to one two three okay so

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,600
without this cycle if we change it to

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,119
iterator and this will stop after three

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,380
iteration because one two three the next

35
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,320
one is

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,299
no elements when you stop we can use the

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,939
second parameter next iterator right

38
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,460
this is iterator and then by default

39
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,219
for example minus one so if we went out

40
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,280
of elements from the iterator if there

41
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,160
is no such next element we pretend the

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,260
default okay so without that it will

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,900
stop it will stop it will just say that

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,360
it will stop so that cycle makes it end

45
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,860
this iterator so in other words cycle

46
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,379
look cycle

47
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,720
cycle one two three is basically means

48
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,520
this one so one two three one two three

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,160
one two three keep going keep going keep

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,720
going okay

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,459
iterator iterator

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,540
makes it possible

53
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:38,280
to point to uh and the list list okay so

54
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,800
there's no such thing as and delete

55
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,680
please and right and this list

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,720
in computer because what's endless what

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,180
does it mean it never stops but you were

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,000
talking about this this is the concrete

59
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,819
thing it's impossible to put endless

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,940
element in the computer

61
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:00,420
am I right if you're asking for Endless

62
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,580
list give me a endless list

63
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,160
so the computer can do it why is that

64
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,400
because computer can put endless element

65
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,040
in the list and okay so this is endless

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,680
with all elements here we go the

67
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,540
computer can do it right okay but with

68
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,540
the iterator computer can do it okay

69
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,580
computer say Okay imagine just imagine I

70
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,260
have an endless list but I can't give

71
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,800
you at once

72
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,620
all right instead you ask me using next

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,599
I give you one you ask me again I give

74
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,239
you two you ask me again I give you

75
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,220
three you ask me again one two three

76
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,440
just imagine this is the end of this

77
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,879
list but I can't give you all at once

78
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,739
all right that's the difference between

79
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,019
list and iterator

80
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,480
okay so with the iterator you can do it

81
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,180
this way so with the internet how do I

82
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,220
give you one when you ask what's the

83
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,159
word sound with why

84
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,379
you'd Yeah well yeah yeah means give it

85
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,140
okay so that's what it means okay okay

86
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:01,140
so how do we implement this uh Exciter

87
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,599
how do we implement

88
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:08,000
so usually

89
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm giving the one two three this is not

90
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,320
how can I turn this into an endless

91
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,220
iterator now let me Define this title

92
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,740
title X okay so look X is one two three

93
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,120
if you ask me three times and I will run

94
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,520
out of it

95
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,860
so after I'd ran out of it what happened

96
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,960
you asked me the fourth time I don't

97
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,180
have element for you when we go through

98
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,720
the anime we need to save copy of it

99
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,900
right save I have a saved which is an

100
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,800
empty this now so for if you ask me for

101
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:47,280
it I in X Y this is iterator I hear the

102
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,259
first I give you the element first and

103
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,580
now what's next I need to put this in

104
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,259
here okay

105
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,280
save

106
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,280
got a pen

107
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,360
all right okay so what does it mean look

108
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,040
if you hear to me if you give me you've

109
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,520
asked me three times I'll give you one

110
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,680
two three but after that that's fine one

111
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,419
two three I put it in safe and yield it

112
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:17,880
right so wire safe why we have any minus

113
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:20,160
eight four I in saved yeah

114
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,160
I this is how we implement the cycle

115
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,500
this is actually very neat beautifully

116
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,900
written look just a few lines of code

117
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,300
defines the cycle it does it's not

118
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,100
really beautiful okay so can you tell me

119
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,680
can you tell me what are we trying to do

120
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,440
here why this can work what does this

121
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,759
mean why do we need to save here here do

122
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,960
you understand this title thing let me

123
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,820
write it again g equals cyta

124
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,860
one two three

125
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,740
Parts yeah okay good question yeah yeah

126
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,320
what's ear remember what I talk about

127
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,979
the end of this thing right yeah you

128
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,800
give it and the little and this and this

129
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:01,680
list you can ask computer for our entry

130
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,840
list this is concrete tangible give me a

131
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,520
list of 100 elements the computer will

132
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,500
feel it at least with one two three four

133
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,840
up to 100 give it to you

134
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,560
I I like computer has memory yeah the

135
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,800
memory the brand when memory

136
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,759
computer memory is called Ram

137
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,979
read excess memory okay so you can put

138
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,380
in these elements in your brain right

139
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:27,360
you can't remember like an animated

140
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,740
number of elements in your brain all

141
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,860
right nobody can do that no computer

142
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:36,479
they can do that instead computer can

143
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:39,900
say imagine I have an end list list you

144
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,419
know it keeps growing it never ends but

145
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,479
I can't give you all these elements to

146
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:48,600
you at once right instead you can ask me

147
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:51,180
one by one okay one two three and you

148
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,639
ask me again one two three one two three

149
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:58,500
remember the cycling one two three okay

150
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,919
yeah one two three okay let's mean one

151
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,199
element in the end this uh this iterator

152
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,520
okay one I'll give you one you ask me

153
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,520
again two

154
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,880
ask me again three ask me again one two

155
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,660
three one two three so when you ask it

156
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:19,919
I give it to you yeah that's what it is

157
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:22,139
list in in in like a circle like one two

158
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,780
three one two the thing is the end of

159
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,819
this how do you put it in my list

160
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,539
as long as you stop it's not end of this

161
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,720
okay so the thing is that here is an

162
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:36,180
endless it never ends yeah but

163
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,180
apparently you're giving one one number

164
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,280
at the time yeah yeah and you said you

165
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,080
can't give it all that's right but I

166
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,840
want to give you one okay so this is the

167
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,460
one way of doing it yeah look you ask me

168
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,099
look G cycle and then I can say four I

169
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,620
in range ten

170
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,139
give me 10 numbers in this end of this

171
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,060
list and I can say print

172
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,240
next

173
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:06,240
G okay look

174
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,639
because in the next G right next GG is

175
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,039
the iterator and then what he does here

176
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,500
yeah once yet happens

177
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,599
it gives back the number to print and

178
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,419
then the next time you call the next

179
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,160
then here will continue to give the next

180
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,500
number

181
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,560
what have you learned today

182
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:29,120
nothing about this cycle yeah focusing

183
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,740
yield

184
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,740
yes you're trying to

185
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:50,279
so you have to give one family each time

186
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,380
each time you ask the computer

187
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,019
because look once I go through this x

188
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,000
once I go through this x I can't go back

189
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:59,820
for the iterator thing is that you know

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,560
you can't go back so if this is a

191
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,560
iterator next G

192
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,500
and you give the one next G give the two

193
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,300
next gives the three next G then you

194
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,880
will be stopping here because there is

195
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,459
no such element after iterator just one

196
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,980
way how do we produce Our Endless

197
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:19,200
iterator the trick is that the first

198
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,200
time we go through the iterator we saved

199
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,800
it in a copy and look because look one

200
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,080
two three after I finish the first e one

201
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,120
two three I know we have one two three

202
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,760
and then the next time

203
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,740
we just look why say why we have element

204
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,440
in the list we just keep doing this keep

205
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,660
returning this yeah keep returning here

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,820
okay it never ends here it never ends

207
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,399
here right it never ends here yeah yeah

208
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,140
why this endless thing is useful okay

209
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,720
just imagine you know that they are

210
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,519
unlimited number of prime numbers right

211
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,040
all right how to improve these are

212
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,980
unlimited look if the first number prime

213
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,240
number is P1 second prime number is P2

214
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,920
and prime number needs to be P3 if they

215
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,100
are limited number of prime numbers

216
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,560
let's say PN right up to pm

217
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,800
and how about if we can't sleep together

218
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,899
that's limited I know I know I'm proving

219
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,940
that it's unlimited so let's assume the

220
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:19,019
opposite it's limited and there are n

221
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:22,500
prime numbers P1 p2p3 up to PN and that

222
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:26,459
comes it together plus one obviously

223
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,660
this number is not divisible by any of

224
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,360
these right

225
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,180
am I right so this is also a prime

226
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,700
number we just assume there are n prime

227
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,580
numbers but now we found another one

228
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,320
so what does it mean the assumption is

229
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,480
wrong the Assumption what's the

230
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,880
Assumption there are n prime numbers

231
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,160
this assumption is wrong

232
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,680
okay so what does it mean it means we

233
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,180
have unlimited number of prime numbers

234
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:56,040
okay

235
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:58,800
okay so but you're saying B1 btp3 but

236
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,899
you only have n two times together and

237
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,180
plus one that's right and this number is

238
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,040
the prime number yeah you only have an N

239
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,740
to multiply by

240
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,980
yes and that's limited because you only

241
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,660
have n yes sir my assumption is that

242
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,120
okay let's assume they are in term

243
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,800
numbers yeah I know that's a small out

244
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,019
of this number plus one comes together

245
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,060
plus one is also a prime number yeah

246
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,240
that's only one more one more okay so

247
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,800
there's only one more so it contracted

248
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,620
it conflicts with the assumption that

249
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,180
only n actually n plus one and I can

250
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,000
keep doing this keep adding this keep

251
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,660
adding it so that means that keeps

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,880
adding

253
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,220
okay I'm assuming they're n prime

254
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,440
numbers but now I found another one

255
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,779
which is not part of this end

256
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,820
okay so I have one more number here

257
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,920
which is the prime number yeah but how

258
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,260
do you add another one

259
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,140
this is another one this is another one

260
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:55,620
yeah so you times that another one where

261
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:58,440
the other end yes so this this number

262
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,000
this number is a new prime number but

263
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,160
when you

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,160
in our first cry number times

265
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,160
number what about number one free look

266
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,740
look two times three it equals six plus

267
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,680
one equals seven you missed a five

268
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,200
that's okay okay so let's assume that

269
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,240
only two prime numbers right let's

270
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,519
assume okay we want to prove there are

271
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,560
only two that they are Limited Brand

272
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,240
number which is two and three now I'm

273
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,459
telling you two times three plus one

274
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,339
this is obviously a prime number

275
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:34,200
seven and then two times three times

276
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,820
seven okay so we found another prime

277
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,519
number which is seven

278
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,560
so the original assumption is wrong they

279
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,320
are not just two prime number because

280
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,260
seven is another prime number

281
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,120
my origin assumptions they are only n

282
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,399
prime numbers now I found another one

283
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,399
number which is point number so it's

284
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,220
contracted the original assumption

285
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,620
so the origin assumption is wrong

286
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,839
the opposite is correct which is there

287
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,600
are unlimited number of prime numbers

288
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,800
this is actually one beautifully proved

289
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,740
mathematic proof of uh beautiful it's

290
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:15,200
not like it's colorful it's literally

291
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:17,820
black meat I'm saying Need need

292
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,019
Okay neither true okay do you understand

293
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,700
yeah

294
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:25,260
yeah it depends if it's neat okay okay

295
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,260
let's coming back to this prime number

296
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,700
thing okay yeah unlimited number of

297
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,200
prime numbers give me the next prime

298
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,360
number

299
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
okay and they are unlimited number of

300
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,260
prime numbers I can't give you all at

301
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,180
once but instead you can ask me okay now

302
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,220
I give you two what's my next one number

303
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,620
three what's the next number five what's

304
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,620
nice number seven what's the number 11.

305
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,660
that's very good let's hand shooting a

306
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,399
very uh you know not trivial and

307
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,279
remember we talk about how do we get a

308
00:13:53,399 --> 00:14:00,959
prime number up to a hundred one two

309
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:04,440
three four five this is uh numbers uh

310
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,360
tier 100 right how do we get all the

311
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,519
numbers prime numbers up to 100 we talk

312
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,959
about that right so one is obviously not

313
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,260
a problem number two it's a prime number

314
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:16,260
right I cross all the duplicates four

315
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:19,339
six eight right financially the prime

316
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:22,459
number I cross all the duplicates six

317
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:25,079
they're just in that time table yeah

318
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:27,720
those are just multiples yeah yeah

319
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:30,480
multiple okay I cross it loud and I can

320
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,040
keep doing this and then remaining uh

321
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,480
the prime numbers I well we talk about

322
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,060
it right you do you still remember this

323
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,800
one but how do you know if two is a

324
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,040
prime number what's the definition of

325
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,839
prime number

326
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,839
divided by one in itself okay one is

327
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,720
yeah yeah yes start with this one so you

328
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,459
have to work it out okay so two two is

329
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,199
the prime number we because it's

330
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:56,579
multiple yeah so you have to work out

331
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:59,699
four two six a etc and then three is a

332
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:02,100
prime number or cosine is uh yeah you

333
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,839
have to work out two and three so and

334
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,360
then we walk through okay this is kind

335
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,100
of the equivalent okay uh do you get

336
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,899
enough and do you learn something new

337
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,540
today

338
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:15,720
if you come from the actual prime number

339
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:19,139
you have to test if it is that's good

340
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,300
yeah how do we tax uh like a 97 is it a

341
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,639
prime number how do we test it well it

342
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,320
is obviously

343
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,260
what what's obvious the computers don't

344
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,060
know what's obviously so how do we test

345
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,760
it we start with two

346
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,940
and then we start with three and then we

347
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,260
test the five

348
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:41,940
seven nine

349
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:43,760
eleven until Nine's not okay until I

350
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,320
know until

351
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,420
square root of 97 right we talk about

352
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,399
that we just have to check all the

353
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:56,279
factors up to square root of N and if 97

354
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,699
cannot be divided by the factor then

355
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:02,040
it's a prime number okay make sense

356
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:05,160
yeah instead of checking though remember

357
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:08,639
we talked about half right 97 so we need

358
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:12,600
to check from number one up to 48. why

359
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,680
do you only need to check uh the square

360
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,899
root

361
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,000
oh yeah you were asking this question

362
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:22,019
means you're thinking yes look 30.

363
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,100
what's the factors 2 times 15. 3 times

364
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:28,139
10. five times six

365
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,220
times five

366
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,220
ten times three

367
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,600
what's next up to half right three times

368
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,100
ten ten times three five times six six

369
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,420
times five

370
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,100
do you see

371
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,459
it's impaired

372
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,839
so if I have n if I have a square root

373
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,940
of n the other one is square root of the

374
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,459
N I just have to check up to

375
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,860
half right the other one three times ten

376
00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:00,779
if it's divided by three it must be

377
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,160
divided by ten right so I don't need to

378
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,679
check this these two are actually

379
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,839
duplicate right so they go into the

380
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,579
middle which is

381
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,579
how is that a square root

382
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,559
100 100

383
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:22,860
20 times five five times twenty ten

384
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,319
times ten ten times ten and then the

385
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,179
next actually in minerals at 10 times 10

386
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,919
right

387
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,480
yeah make sense

388
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,760
does it make sense now

389
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,340
okay yeah that's a very good question

390
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,880
that's a very very good question means

391
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:43,340
you're thinking yeah okay okay so let's

392
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,340
see for today bye bye bye bye

393
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,400
foreign
