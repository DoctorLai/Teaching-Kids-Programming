you got the idea so this square root is

24
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
you got the idea so this square root is
 

25
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,470
you got the idea so this square root is
also you can also write it as

26
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
also you can also write it as
 

27
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,990
also you can also write it as
as half yeah yeah to the power

28
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
as half yeah yeah to the power
 

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,549
as half yeah yeah to the power
of half yeah it's the same thing yeah or

30
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
of half yeah it's the same thing yeah or
 

31
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,270
of half yeah it's the same thing yeah or
sometimes

32
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
sometimes
 

33
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,549
sometimes
you can do it 0.5 so it's the same thing

34
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
you can do it 0.5 so it's the same thing
 

35
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,990
you can do it 0.5 so it's the same thing
yeah do you get it yes yeah

36
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
yeah do you get it yes yeah
 

37
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,350
yeah do you get it yes yeah
so now we are going to write a function

38
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
so now we are going to write a function
 

39
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,790
so now we are going to write a function
to calculate the value

to calculate the value
 

41
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,110
to calculate the value
for example why are we doing this look

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
for example why are we doing this look
 

43
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,030
for example why are we doing this look
this is

44
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
this is
 

45
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,710
this is
what's this triangle

46
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
what's this triangle
 

47
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,070
what's this triangle
and if i tell you this is 90 degrees

48
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
and if i tell you this is 90 degrees
 

49
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,230
and if i tell you this is 90 degrees
this is the right triangle right with

50
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
this is the right triangle right with
 

51
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,469
this is the right triangle right with
the right angle triangle

52
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
the right angle triangle
 

53
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,230
the right angle triangle
how about if i tell you this is three

54
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
how about if i tell you this is three
 

55
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,510
how about if i tell you this is three
this is four and

56
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
this is four and
 

57
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,230
this is four and
what's the length of this side do you

58
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
what's the length of this side do you
 

59
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,749
what's the length of this side do you
still remember

60
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759

 

61
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,109

no if this is right angle okay and if

62
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
no if this is right angle okay and if
 

63
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,550
no if this is right angle okay and if
this is a this is b and this is c so

64
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
this is a this is b and this is c so
 

65
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,630
this is a this is b and this is c so
it must certify let alone

66
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
it must certify let alone
 

67
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,109
it must certify let alone
a squared plus b squared equals c

68
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
a squared plus b squared equals c
 

69
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:43,830
a squared plus b squared equals c
squared

70
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
squared
 

71
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,030
squared
is it easy look this is three it is four

72
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
is it easy look this is three it is four
 

73
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,710
is it easy look this is three it is four
so three squared plus four

74
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
so three squared plus four
 

75
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,910
so three squared plus four
squared equals five squared this is nine

76
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
squared equals five squared this is nine
 

77
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,109
squared equals five squared this is nine
plus 16 equals 25. okay

78
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
plus 16 equals 25. okay
 

79
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,190
plus 16 equals 25. okay
if it is a triangle and this is right

80
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
if it is a triangle and this is right
 

81
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,109
if it is a triangle and this is right
angle it must certify that

82
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
angle it must certify that
 

83
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,429
angle it must certify that
do you get it yeah yeah

length of this side
 

105
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,670
length of this side
it's one square plus one square equals

106
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
it's one square plus one square equals
 

107
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,190
it's one square plus one square equals
this side yeah let's try

108
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
this side yeah let's try
 

109
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,430
this side yeah let's try
c square so that's two square equals c

110
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
c square so that's two square equals c
 

111
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,830
c square so that's two square equals c
square c squared

112
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
square c squared
 

113
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,550
square c squared
yes no no no what once

and this is one and this is one and then
 

143
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,710
and this is one and this is one and then
what's

144
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
what's
 

145
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,070
what's
this side uh

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
this side uh
 

147
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,229
this side uh
it's gonna be square root of two

148
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
it's gonna be square root of two
 

149
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,350
it's gonna be square root of two
what square root of two yeah what's the

what square root of two yeah what's the
 

151
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,869
what square root of two yeah what's the
square root of two

152
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
square root of two
 

153
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,430
square root of two
it's a number between one and two right

154
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
it's a number between one and two right
 

155
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:25,910
it's a number between one and two right
and

156
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
and
 

157
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,149
and
it then how about we taking at least

158
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
it then how about we taking at least
 

159
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,830
it then how about we taking at least
value what

160
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
value what
 

161
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,190
value what
is it it must be between 1 and 2 right

162
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
is it it must be between 1 and 2 right
 

163
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,990
is it it must be between 1 and 2 right
yes because 1 square is 1 right 2

164
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
yes because 1 square is 1 right 2
 

165
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,750
yes because 1 square is 1 right 2
squared is 4 right

166
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
squared is 4 right
 

167
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,670
squared is 4 right
yes if we square it it's 2 so

168
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
yes if we square it it's 2 so
 

169
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,589
yes if we square it it's 2 so
how about e and precisely is between

170
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
how about e and precisely is between
 

171
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,830
how about e and precisely is between
one and one point five because one point

172
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
one and one point five because one point
 

173
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,110
one and one point five because one point
five square

174
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
five square
 

175
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,470
five square
equals one fifteen square equals one

176
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
equals one fifteen square equals one
 

177
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,910
equals one fifteen square equals one
uh 225 i know one point five is two

178
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
uh 225 i know one point five is two
 

179
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,990
uh 225 i know one point five is two
two point two point five right yeah one

180
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
two point two point five right yeah one
 

181
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,990
two point two point five right yeah one
point five square equals two

182
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
point five square equals two
 

183
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,270
point five square equals two
dot two point five look c square equals

184
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
dot two point five look c square equals
 

185
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,750
dot two point five look c square equals
two

186
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
two
 

187
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,550
two
okay and i say one point five square

188
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
okay and i say one point five square
 

189
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,830
okay and i say one point five square
equals two

190
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
equals two
 

191
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,869
equals two
to twenty-five one square equals one

192
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
to twenty-five one square equals one
 

193
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,110
to twenty-five one square equals one
so c is the value between one and one

194
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
so c is the value between one and one
 

195
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,629
so c is the value between one and one
point five all right

196
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
point five all right
 

197
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,830
point five all right
yes it's because it's the middle so so

198
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
yes it's because it's the middle so so
 

199
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,110
yes it's because it's the middle so so
that's very interesting because we know

200
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
that's very interesting because we know
 

201
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,830
that's very interesting because we know
this function square root y equals

202
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
this function square root y equals
 

203
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,870
this function square root y equals
square root x

204
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
square root x
 

205
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,070
square root x
is monotone remember the word

206
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
is monotone remember the word
 

207
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,110
is monotone remember the word
monotone

208
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120

 

209
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,550

monitor increasing it means the bigger

210
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
monitor increasing it means the bigger
 

211
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,870
monitor increasing it means the bigger
of

212
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
of
 

213
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,629
of
x and the figure of

214
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
x and the figure of
 

215
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,990
x and the figure of
y right if x is increasing y is also

216
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
y right if x is increasing y is also
 

217
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,430
y right if x is increasing y is also
increasing right

218
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
increasing right
 

219
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,430
increasing right
all right yeah so if we plot this

220
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
all right yeah so if we plot this
 

221
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,990
all right yeah so if we plot this
function

222
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
function
 

223
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,710
function
right n this is going to be interesting

224
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
right n this is going to be interesting
 

225
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,670
right n this is going to be interesting
this is x

226
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
this is x
 

227
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,710
this is x
this one x is zero

228
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
this one x is zero
 

229
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,150
this one x is zero
actually one x is zero y is one when x

230
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
actually one x is zero y is one when x
 

231
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,790
actually one x is zero y is one when x
is zero

232
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
is zero
 

233
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,629
is zero
y is zero yeah we're done when x is y

234
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
y is zero yeah we're done when x is y
 

235
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,909
y is zero yeah we're done when x is y
y is what what do you say when x is one

236
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
y is what what do you say when x is one
 

237
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,110
y is what what do you say when x is one
one one yes one square of one is one

238
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
one one yes one square of one is one
 

239
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,870
one one yes one square of one is one
yeah so this here

240
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
yeah so this here
 

241
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,990
yeah so this here
one x is four fifteen

242
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
one x is four fifteen
 

243
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,189
one x is four fifteen
no no no actually small four square

244
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
no no no actually small four square
 

245
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,909
no no no actually small four square
square root of okay yeah we're done two

246
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
square root of okay yeah we're done two
 

247
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,430
square root of okay yeah we're done two
so this is one

248
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
so this is one
 

249
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,950
so this is one
uh this is two three four four here

250
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
uh this is two three four four here
 

251
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,029
uh this is two three four four here
and then there will be two right two

252
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
and then there will be two right two
 

253
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,150
and then there will be two right two
here yeah

254
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
here yeah
 

255
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,270
here yeah
two here okay so

256
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
two here okay so
 

257
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:45,990
two here okay so
when x is nine x is nine

258
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000

 

259
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,749

approximately here yeah it's

260
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
approximately here yeah it's
 

261
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,990
approximately here yeah it's
approximately here so you push it

262
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
approximately here so you push it
 

263
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,950
approximately here so you push it
so you if you plot this line you'll be

264
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
so you if you plot this line you'll be
 

265
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,629
so you if you plot this line you'll be
something like that right

266
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
something like that right
 

267
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,749
something like that right
something like that okay

268
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759

 

269
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,309

it looks a bit weird yeah yeah yeah

270
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
it looks a bit weird yeah yeah yeah
 

271
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,830
it looks a bit weird yeah yeah yeah
actually it's it's a curve

272
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
actually it's it's a curve
 

273
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,830
actually it's it's a curve
i i didn't draw it properly so it's a

274
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
i i didn't draw it properly so it's a
 

275
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,309
i i didn't draw it properly so it's a
curve okay it's a curve like a

276
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
curve okay it's a curve like a
 

277
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,510
curve okay it's a curve like a
monotony increasing curve now

278
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
monotony increasing curve now
 

279
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,309
monotony increasing curve now
okay okay yeah yeah i'm very bad at

280
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
okay okay yeah yeah i'm very bad at
 

281
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,830
okay okay yeah yeah i'm very bad at
drawing but you you kind of

282
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
drawing but you you kind of
 

283
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,950
drawing but you you kind of
meaning now so when x when x is

284
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
meaning now so when x when x is
 

285
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,230
meaning now so when x when x is
increasing

286
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
increasing
 

287
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,270
increasing
the y is also increasing yeah

288
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
the y is also increasing yeah
 

289
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,230
the y is also increasing yeah
okay so now look where's two when x is

290
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
okay so now look where's two when x is
 

291
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,110
okay so now look where's two when x is
two

292
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
two
 

293
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,029
two
yeah yeah yeah x x two here

294
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
yeah yeah yeah x x two here
 

295
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,990
yeah yeah yeah x x two here
and this is two this is two yeah one x

296
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
and this is two this is two yeah one x
 

297
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,110
and this is two this is two yeah one x
is four this is two

298
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
is four this is two
 

299
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,870
is four this is two
so here is between one and two right

300
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
so here is between one and two right
 

301
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,350
so here is between one and two right
yeah so this uh square root of two

302
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
yeah so this uh square root of two
 

303
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,430
yeah so this uh square root of two
here is somewhere here right yeah we

304
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
here is somewhere here right yeah we
 

305
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,270
here is somewhere here right yeah we
don't know yeah so we

306
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
don't know yeah so we
 

307
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,430
don't know yeah so we
we can you how can we calculate this

308
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
we can you how can we calculate this
 

309
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,350
we can you how can we calculate this
value

310
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
value
 

311
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,749
value
interesting i give you a hint final

312
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
interesting i give you a hint final
 

313
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,589
interesting i give you a hint final
research

314
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
research
 

315
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,550
research
yeah look if this moment is increasing

316
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
yeah look if this moment is increasing
 

317
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,230
yeah look if this moment is increasing
let's get the value right

318
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240

 

319
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,510

if if uh let's get some value like the

320
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
if if uh let's get some value like the
 

321
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,870
if if uh let's get some value like the
the left left low left bound is zero

322
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
the left left low left bound is zero
 

323
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,670
the left left low left bound is zero
right it can't be

324
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
right it can't be
 

325
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,070
right it can't be
smaller than zero right yeah and the

326
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
smaller than zero right yeah and the
 

327
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,790
smaller than zero right yeah and the
right bound if it's more than one we

328
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
right bound if it's more than one we
 

329
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,029
right bound if it's more than one we
we say it's x now we find a denominator

330
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
we say it's x now we find a denominator
 

331
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,670
we say it's x now we find a denominator
and now we do this a s square to check

332
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
and now we do this a s square to check
 

333
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:30,710
and now we do this a s square to check
if it's bigger than the value 1.7

334
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720

 

335
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,550

one point something yeah one point and

336
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
one point something yeah one point and
 

337
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,710
one point something yeah one point and
then if it's smaller than we cut into

338
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
then if it's smaller than we cut into
 

339
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,510
then if it's smaller than we cut into
half remember

340
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
half remember
 

341
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,909
half remember
one point okay so no

342
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
one point okay so no
 

343
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,070
one point okay so no
i show you the value later okay if

344
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
i show you the value later okay if
 

345
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,270
i show you the value later okay if
you're interested okay

346
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
you're interested okay
 

347
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,430
you're interested okay
let's do this define final square root

348
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
let's do this define final square root
 

349
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,430
let's do this define final square root
definitely close

350
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
definitely close
 

351
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,029
definitely close
x okay left column

352
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
x okay left column
 

353
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,749
x okay left column
okay so if x is smaller than zero we

354
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
okay so if x is smaller than zero we
 

355
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,589
okay so if x is smaller than zero we
return now because there's no

356
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
return now because there's no
 

357
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,430
return now because there's no
such value why because

358
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
such value why because
 

359
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,909
such value why because
you can't find any real number okay

360
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919

 

361
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,270

let me check it yeah you cannot find

362
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
let me check it yeah you cannot find
 

363
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,510
let me check it yeah you cannot find
any negative you cannot find any real

364
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
any negative you cannot find any real
 

365
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,110
any negative you cannot find any real
number like square

366
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
number like square
 

367
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,670
number like square
equals negative all right what i'm

368
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
equals negative all right what i'm
 

369
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,830
equals negative all right what i'm
talking about is real number

370
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
talking about is real number
 

371
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,670
talking about is real number
okay you will have you will learn

372
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
okay you will have you will learn
 

373
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,230
okay you will have you will learn
other numbers other than real numbers

374
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
other numbers other than real numbers
 

375
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,230
other numbers other than real numbers
imaginary numbers later

376
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
imaginary numbers later
 

377
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,869
imaginary numbers later
but these these the numbers we use daily

378
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
but these these the numbers we use daily
 

379
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,350
but these these the numbers we use daily
like

380
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
like
 

381
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,949
like
one two three two two and a half yeah

382
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
one two three two two and a half yeah
 

383
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,509
one two three two two and a half yeah
yeah square root of two are real numbers

384
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
yeah square root of two are real numbers
 

385
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,790
yeah square root of two are real numbers
okay these are the numbers yeah

386
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
okay these are the numbers yeah
 

387
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,909
okay these are the numbers yeah
we know okay so look if x is

388
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
we know okay so look if x is
 

389
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,509
we know okay so look if x is
smaller than zero we return now okay

390
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
smaller than zero we return now okay
 

391
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,829
smaller than zero we return now okay
yeah yeah that makes sense okay now

392
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839

 

393
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,389

if x

394
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
if x
 

395
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,750
if x
is smaller than one

396
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
is smaller than one
 

397
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,910
is smaller than one
left right if it's smaller than one

398
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
left right if it's smaller than one
 

399
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,230
left right if it's smaller than one
left and right left is zero always the

400
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
left and right left is zero always the
 

401
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,949
left and right left is zero always the
right bound

402
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:04,959
right bound
 

403
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,750
right bound
we set it to one right because if it's

404
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
we set it to one right because if it's
 

405
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,990
we set it to one right because if it's
actually smaller than one

406
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
actually smaller than one
 

407
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,230
actually smaller than one
square root of x is also smaller than

408
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
square root of x is also smaller than
 

409
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,070
square root of x is also smaller than
one yeah

410
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
one yeah
 

411
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,430
one yeah
yeah so we set it to we set it to one

412
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
yeah so we set it to we set it to one
 

413
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,949
yeah so we set it to we set it to one
okay ah otherwise if if x is bigger than

414
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
okay ah otherwise if if x is bigger than
 

415
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,350
okay ah otherwise if if x is bigger than
one the left is zero

416
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360

 

417
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,990

why we set it to x because when what x

418
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
why we set it to x because when what x
 

419
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,070
why we set it to x because when what x
is bigger than one

420
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
is bigger than one
 

421
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,630
is bigger than one
the when x is bigger than one square

422
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
the when x is bigger than one square
 

423
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,590
the when x is bigger than one square
root of x

424
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
root of x
 

425
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,070
root of x
is smaller than x right when x is bigger

426
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
is smaller than x right when x is bigger
 

427
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,190
is smaller than x right when x is bigger
than one okay

428
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
than one okay
 

429
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,389
than one okay
got it got it yeah

430
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
got it got it yeah
 

431
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,990
got it got it yeah
yeah so now we we said after we

432
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
yeah so now we we said after we
 

433
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,710
yeah so now we we said after we
then we have at least

434
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720

 

435
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,430

now we we need to have this meter value

436
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
now we we need to have this meter value
 

437
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,310
now we we need to have this meter value
that we set it to

438
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
that we set it to
 

439
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,110
that we set it to
counter value let's say we cut the value

440
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
counter value let's say we cut the value
 

441
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,230
counter value let's say we cut the value
and

442
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
and
 

443
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,070
and
middle value and let's all set it to

444
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
middle value and let's all set it to
 

445
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,509
middle value and let's all set it to
zero because the middle value is the

446
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
zero because the middle value is the
 

447
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,870
zero because the middle value is the
initial value yeah

448
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
initial value yeah
 

449
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,550
initial value yeah
then we can have y it's zero at the

450
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
then we can have y it's zero at the
 

451
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,430
then we can have y it's zero at the
beginning

452
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
beginning
 

453
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,630
beginning
we guess this this number is the number

454
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
we guess this this number is the number
 

455
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,310
we guess this this number is the number
we guess

456
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
we guess
 

457
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,470
we guess
okay we guess it's the square root of

458
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
okay we guess it's the square root of
 

459
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,509
okay we guess it's the square root of
anything is

460
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
anything is
 

461
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,030
anything is
zero this guess is not right right

462
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
zero this guess is not right right
 

463
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,190
zero this guess is not right right
don't worry we made the guess the result

464
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
don't worry we made the guess the result
 

465
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,190
don't worry we made the guess the result
is the current is the

466
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
is the current is the
 

467
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,389
is the current is the
mid times me to the power of to me times

468
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
mid times me to the power of to me times
 

469
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,949
mid times me to the power of to me times
multiplied by mean so now why

470
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
multiplied by mean so now why
 

471
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,990
multiplied by mean so now why
abs do we still remember abs

472
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
abs do we still remember abs
 

473
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,910
abs do we still remember abs
absolute value right yeah that's the

474
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
absolute value right yeah that's the
 

475
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,269
absolute value right yeah that's the
real value if this current value

476
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,279
real value if this current value
 

477
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,790
real value if this current value
corr minus x yeah

478
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
corr minus x yeah
 

479
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,990
corr minus x yeah
is b still bigger than an arrow arrow we

480
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
is b still bigger than an arrow arrow we
 

481
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,630
is b still bigger than an arrow arrow we
set it to

482
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
set it to
 

483
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,110
set it to
one e minus five so it's zero point zero

484
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
one e minus five so it's zero point zero
 

485
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,470
one e minus five so it's zero point zero
zero zero one it's a very small

486
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
zero zero one it's a very small
 

487
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,509
zero zero one it's a very small
difference right

488
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
difference right
 

489
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,230
difference right
when it's bigger than that then we we do

490
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
when it's bigger than that then we we do
 

491
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,910
when it's bigger than that then we we do
this meet

492
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
this meet
 

493
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,670
this meet
equals left plus y equals

494
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
equals left plus y equals
 

495
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,590
equals left plus y equals
then what meter meter how do you get the

496
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
then what meter meter how do you get the
 

497
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,350
then what meter meter how do you get the
meter from left and right

498
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
meter from left and right
 

499
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,190
meter from left and right
left cross right what divided by

500
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
left cross right what divided by
 

501
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,509
left cross right what divided by
two two yeah that's the meter we get the

502
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
two two yeah that's the meter we get the
 

503
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,710
two two yeah that's the meter we get the
middle

504
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
middle
 

505
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,310
middle
right which is misu

506
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
right which is misu
 

507
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,990
right which is misu
and current would be meat times meat

508
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
and current would be meat times meat
 

509
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,949
and current would be meat times meat
yeah this is the main

510
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
yeah this is the main
 

511
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,389
yeah this is the main
value we get is

512
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
value we get is
 

513
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,790
value we get is
carbon is bigger than the x

514
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
carbon is bigger than the x
 

515
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,630
carbon is bigger than the x
right so if this is bigger than x

516
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
right so if this is bigger than x
 

517
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,430
right so if this is bigger than x
so it means that it's in the lower half

518
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
so it means that it's in the lower half
 

519
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,990
so it means that it's in the lower half
right

520
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
right
 

521
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,790
right
because the gas value is bigger than

522
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
because the gas value is bigger than
 

523
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,310
because the gas value is bigger than
bigger than the

524
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
bigger than the
 

525
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,110
bigger than the
guess value guess value is meet me

526
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
guess value guess value is meet me
 

527
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,630
guess value guess value is meet me
transmit is bigger than x

528
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
transmit is bigger than x
 

529
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,790
transmit is bigger than x
it means that we get a value which is

530
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
it means that we get a value which is
 

531
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,310
it means that we get a value which is
larger right so now then we can we can

532
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
larger right so now then we can we can
 

533
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,710
larger right so now then we can we can
search in the lower half which is which

534
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
search in the lower half which is which
 

535
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,269
search in the lower half which is which
we need to say right

536
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
we need to say right
 

537
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,829
we need to say right
equals meat right else

538
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
equals meat right else
 

539
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,509
equals meat right else
as well not as economy what

540
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
as well not as economy what
 

541
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,110
as well not as economy what
if it's smaller than x what does it mean

542
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
if it's smaller than x what does it mean
 

543
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,790
if it's smaller than x what does it mean
it's on the upper side yeah so we say

544
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
it's on the upper side yeah so we say
 

545
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,670
it's on the upper side yeah so we say
the left

546
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
the left
 

547
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,110
the left
equals one mid

548
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
equals one mid
 

549
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,670
equals one mid
right yeah because look left left and

550
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
right yeah because look left left and
 

551
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,470
right yeah because look left left and
right

552
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
right
 

553
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,670
right
left right and then let's meet yeah

554
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
left right and then let's meet yeah
 

555
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,230
left right and then let's meet yeah
if current is bigger than x then it

556
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
if current is bigger than x then it
 

557
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,269
if current is bigger than x then it
means that

558
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
means that
 

559
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,670
means that
the value is not in the upper part it's

560
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
the value is not in the upper part it's
 

561
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,509
the value is not in the upper part it's
in the lower bound so we said

562
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
in the lower bound so we said
 

563
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,310
in the lower bound so we said
right equals mean yeah if it's in the

564
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
right equals mean yeah if it's in the
 

565
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,990
right equals mean yeah if it's in the
upper bound and we said left equals

566
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
upper bound and we said left equals
 

567
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,389
upper bound and we said left equals
mid right so every time we cut into half

568
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
mid right so every time we cut into half
 

569
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,670
mid right so every time we cut into half
cut into half

570
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
cut into half
 

571
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,790
cut into half
right yes and after this what should we

572
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
right yes and after this what should we
 

573
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,750
right yes and after this what should we
do return what

574
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760

 

575
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,629

return what return meat or current

576
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
return what return meat or current
 

577
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,590
return what return meat or current
current

578
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
current
 

579
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,150
current
mid mid return means because myth is the

580
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
mid mid return means because myth is the
 

581
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,870
mid mid return means because myth is the
value

582
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
value
 

583
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,350
value
of the square root current is the square

584
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
of the square root current is the square

587
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,550
root
times square root right is the it's the

588
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
times square root right is the it's the
 

589
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,550
times square root right is the it's the
variable result we are comparing to x

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
variable result we are comparing to x
 

591
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,880

okay let's do this look
 

605
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,870
okay let's do this look
what one means

606
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880

 

607
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,750

yeah yeah yes enough okay let's define

608
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
yeah yeah yes enough okay let's define
 

609
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,750
yeah yeah yes enough okay let's define
square root yeah

610
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
square root yeah

none yes if x is smaller than one
 

617
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,629
none yes if x is smaller than one
let's write equals zero one right

618
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
let's write equals zero one right
 

619
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,350
let's write equals zero one right
because they

620
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
because they
 

621
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,350
because they
if it's smaller than one its upper bound

622
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
if it's smaller than one its upper bound
 

623
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,470
if it's smaller than one its upper bound
should be one

624
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
should be one
 

625
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,910

small error which is we we allow the

638
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
small error which is we we allow the
 

639
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,069
small error which is we we allow the
error like

uh error okay

648
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160

00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
divided by what two okay
 

659
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,790
divided by what two okay
then current equals mid one

660
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
then current equals mid one
 

661
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,230
then current equals mid one
times meter right you can also do this

662
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
times meter right you can also do this

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,870
two okay it's the same thing
if current is bigger than x

668
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:32,880
if current is bigger than x
 

669
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,269
if current is bigger than x
so what should we change

670
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279

 

671
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:53,030

right equals one

672
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040

 

673
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,550

let's do this for i in range 10 okay

674
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
let's do this for i in range 10 okay
 

675
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,990
let's do this for i in range 10 okay
let's do this

676
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
let's do this
 

677
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,269
let's do this
then print square root

678
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
then print square root
 

679
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,110
then print square root
of square root of

680
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
of square root of
 

681
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,870
of square root of
i is

682
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880

 

683
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,069

square root of i okay

684
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
square root of i okay
 

685
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,069
square root of i okay
let's print it let's see if it works

686
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
let's print it let's see if it works
 

687
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,949
let's print it let's see if it works
okay tyson

688
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:17,959
okay tyson
 

689
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:21,990
okay tyson
sqrt does it make sense can you make a

690
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
sqrt does it make sense can you make a
 

691
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,790
sqrt does it make sense can you make a
can you check if

692
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
can you check if
 

693
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,670
can you check if
the values are all right the square root

694
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
the values are all right the square root
 

695
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,949
the values are all right the square root
of zero

696
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
of zero
 

697
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,470
of zero
is zero yes square root of one yeah

698
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
is zero yes square root of one yeah
 

699
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,069
is zero yes square root of one yeah
because computer hyphen uh look

700
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
because computer hyphen uh look
 

701
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,030
because computer hyphen uh look
because look the fight one two three

702
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
because look the fight one two three
 

703
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,350
because look the fight one two three
four

704
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
four
 

705
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,310
four
five yeah if if we change this error

706
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
five yeah if if we change this error
 

707
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,030
five yeah if if we change this error
okay

708
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
okay
 

709
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,269
okay
if we change the error by default to

710
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
if we change the error by default to
 

711
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,550
if we change the error by default to
uh to a and

712
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
uh to a and
 

713
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,230
uh to a and
and you can see what's the difference

714
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
and you can see what's the difference
 

715
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,230
and you can see what's the difference
okay

716
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
okay
 

717
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,629
okay
okay so you see they're more nice yeah

718
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
okay so you see they're more nice yeah
 

719
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,670
okay so you see they're more nice yeah
they're more nice

720
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
they're more nice
 

721
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,150
they're more nice
right so this is because computer

722
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
right so this is because computer
 

723
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,670
right so this is because computer
calculated and

724
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
calculated and
 

725
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,749
calculated and
using this floating point there's always

726
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
using this floating point there's always
 

727
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,030
using this floating point there's always
a small mistake but this

728
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
a small mistake but this
 

729
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,069
a small mistake but this
this value is very close to one and look

730
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
this value is very close to one and look
 

731
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,909
this value is very close to one and look
square root of two yeah the value you

732
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:07,919
square root of two yeah the value you
 

733
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,309
square root of two yeah the value you
want to know is one point four one yeah

734
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
want to know is one point four one yeah
 

735
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,429
want to know is one point four one yeah
all right so

736
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
all right so
 

737
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,350
all right so
we can click and look at seven and let's

738
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
we can click and look at seven and let's
 

739
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,990
we can click and look at seven and let's
try the number between one and zero okay

740
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
try the number between one and zero okay
 

741
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,909
try the number between one and zero okay
let's try let's try uh

742
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919
let's try let's try uh
 

743
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,029
let's try let's try uh
let's verify okay print you want to know

744
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
let's verify okay print you want to know
 

745
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,350
let's verify okay print you want to know
that

746
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
that
 

747
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,230
that
one point four one yeah times one point

748
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
one point four one yeah times one point
 

749
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,870
one point four one yeah times one point
four one

750
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
four one
 

751
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,470
four one
four i think it's 1.454 let's let's just

752
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
four i think it's 1.454 let's let's just
 

753
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:32,950
four i think it's 1.454 let's let's just
uh

754
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
uh
 

755
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,190
uh
come sleep twice so you can do this

756
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
come sleep twice so you can do this
 

757
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,310
come sleep twice so you can do this
square

758
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
square
 

759
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,750
square
yeah print sqrt

760
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
yeah print sqrt
 

761
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,669
yeah print sqrt
sqlt let's say 0.5

762
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
sqlt let's say 0.5
 

763
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,029
sqlt let's say 0.5
okay and print sqrt

764
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:48,039
okay and print sqrt
 

765
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,789
okay and print sqrt
0.01

766
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
0.01
 

767
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,150
0.01
okay let's see if what does it come to

768
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
okay let's see if what does it come to
 

769
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,750
okay let's see if what does it come to
look look yes you see that its value is

770
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
look look yes you see that its value is
 

771
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,590
look look yes you see that its value is
very close to 2 so it means that the

772
00:17:59,590 --> 00:17:59,600
very close to 2 so it means that the
 

773
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,190
very close to 2 so it means that the
value

774
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
value
 

775
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,510
value
because we what we just do is one point

776
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
because we what we just do is one point
 

777
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,750
because we what we just do is one point
four five one four times itself

778
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
four five one four times itself
 

779
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,230
four five one four times itself
is is equal to one point nine nine so

780
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
is is equal to one point nine nine so
 

781
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,070
is is equal to one point nine nine so
it's very close to two right

782
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
it's very close to two right
 

783
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,470
it's very close to two right
so the square root of two is that it

784
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
so the square root of two is that it
 

785
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,990
so the square root of two is that it
means it's correct

786
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
means it's correct
 

787
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,870
means it's correct
0.70 this is the square root of 0.01

788
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:18,880
0.70 this is the square root of 0.01
 

789
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,350
0.70 this is the square root of 0.01
uh yes square root of 0.01 yes because

790
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
uh yes square root of 0.01 yes because
 

791
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,270
uh yes square root of 0.01 yes because
0.1 times 0.1 is 0.001 okay

792
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
0.1 times 0.1 is 0.001 okay
 

793
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,630
0.1 times 0.1 is 0.001 okay
so this is correct yeah so let's let's

794
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
so this is correct yeah so let's let's
 

795
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,210
so this is correct yeah so let's let's
check if this you know no none is one

796
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:34,220
check if this you know no none is one
 

797
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,750
check if this you know no none is one
[Music]

798
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760

 

799
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,350

so let's go through this again square

800
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
so let's go through this again square
 

801
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,870
so let's go through this again square
root with this arrow

802
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
root with this arrow
 

803
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,029
root with this arrow
and smaller than one we set the range

804
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
and smaller than one we set the range
 

805
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,310
and smaller than one we set the range
from we

806
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
from we
 

807
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,710
from we
basically this left and right is define

808
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
basically this left and right is define
 

809
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,390
basically this left and right is define
the range we are searching the value so

810
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,400
the range we are searching the value so
 

811
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,870
the range we are searching the value so
we define the range between zero and one

812
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
we define the range between zero and one
 

813
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,029
we define the range between zero and one
we search the value between zero and one

814
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
we search the value between zero and one
 

815
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,070
we search the value between zero and one
at least left

816
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,080
at least left
 

817
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,750
at least left
if x is bigger than one we search the

818
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
if x is bigger than one we search the
 

819
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,190
if x is bigger than one we search the
value between zero and x

820
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
value between zero and x
 

821
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,190
value between zero and x
do you get it yeah yeah

822
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
do you get it yeah yeah
 

823
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,990
do you get it yeah yeah
if it's x is bigger than one actually we

824
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,000
if it's x is bigger than one actually we
 

825
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,150
if it's x is bigger than one actually we
can search the value between one and x

826
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,160
can search the value between one and x
 

827
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,590
can search the value between one and x
right i'm right yeah so so actually you

828
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
right i'm right yeah so so actually you
 

829
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,950
right i'm right yeah so so actually you
can you can

830
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
can you can
 

831
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,070
can you can
uh you can change this point because

832
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
uh you can change this point because
 

833
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,470
uh you can change this point because
it can't be less than one right all

834
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
it can't be less than one right all
 

835
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,350
it can't be less than one right all
right

836
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360
right
 

837
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,230
right
so if you if you run it again it still

838
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
so if you if you run it again it still
 

839
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,470
so if you if you run it again it still
finds the value right you see

840
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
finds the value right you see
 

841
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,909
finds the value right you see
yeah yeah it's still i still get it

842
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
yeah yeah it's still i still get it
 

843
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,630
yeah yeah it's still i still get it
so and then when we find when these

844
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
so and then when we find when these
 

845
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,470
so and then when we find when these
errors current value is

846
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
errors current value is
 

847
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,350
errors current value is
bigger than uh and x is bigger than the

848
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
bigger than uh and x is bigger than the
 

849
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,510
bigger than uh and x is bigger than the
difference then we find the meter

850
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
difference then we find the meter
 

851
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,230
difference then we find the meter
and then we calculate the value and if

852
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
and then we calculate the value and if
 

853
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,710
and then we calculate the value and if
the

854
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
the
 

855
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,990
the
x if the current value is bigger than x

856
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
x if the current value is bigger than x
 

857
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,470
x if the current value is bigger than x
then we know it's not in the upper bound

858
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
then we know it's not in the upper bound
 

859
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,230
then we know it's not in the upper bound
we search in the first half right

860
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
we search in the first half right
 

861
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,150
we search in the first half right
otherwise we search in the second half

862
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,160
otherwise we search in the second half
 

863
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,590
otherwise we search in the second half
do you get it

864
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
do you get it
 

865
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,270
do you get it
yes so you always repeat repeat wt until

866
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
yes so you always repeat repeat wt until
 

867
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,750
yes so you always repeat repeat wt until
find a

868
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
find a
 

869
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,190
find a
very very close to very closely

870
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
very very close to very closely
 

871
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,150
very very close to very closely
this abs current minus x this is

872
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
this abs current minus x this is
 

873
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,110
this abs current minus x this is
calculated

874
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
calculated
 

875
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,750
calculated
difference between these two values

876
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
difference between these two values
 

877
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,470
difference between these two values
current and

878
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
current and
 

879
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,350
current and
x right and then if it's bigger than the

880
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
x right and then if it's bigger than the
 

881
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,990
x right and then if it's bigger than the
error

882
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
error
 

883
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,549
error
then we always repeat repeat until we

884
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
then we always repeat repeat until we
 

885
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,430
then we always repeat repeat until we
find a value which is very close to x

886
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
find a value which is very close to x
 

887
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,190
find a value which is very close to x
when we find the current which is very

888
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,200
when we find the current which is very
 

889
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,789
when we find the current which is very
close x what does it mean

890
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
close x what does it mean
 

891
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,110
close x what does it mean
it means that the middle value is the

892
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
it means that the middle value is the
 

893
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,710
it means that the middle value is the
square root of

894
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
square root of
 

895
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,870
square root of
x then we return the mean okay

896
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
x then we return the mean okay
 

897
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,230
x then we return the mean okay
