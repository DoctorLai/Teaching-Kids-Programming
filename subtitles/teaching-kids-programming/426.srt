1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,359
go hello hello guys hello hi you've been

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,759
playing rubik's cube for a while yeah so

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,760
today with our surgeries is to count how

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,920
many different possibilities

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,360
for the configuration of lubricant

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,279
so look that's one a little bit cute

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,880
how it looks like inside you see it

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,840
looks like so how many of these how many

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,000
colors

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,039
yeah how many of these

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,920
um they're six six so no matter how i

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,679
change they they don't change right so

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,480
the positions don't they don't change

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,040
the

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,399
yellow the opposite will be

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,680
white yeah it doesn't change right so so

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
the different

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,239
the different permutation of the

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,800
logic cube is just basically i put these

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,039
pieces back in yeah i put it back right

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,039
yeah so the first question is how many

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,840
of these hq how many of energy cubes

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,719
energy cube 12

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,559
yeah so hq these these are executed

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,440
three four in the top

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,199
four in a meter and four in the bottom

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,320
that's 12 yes and how many corner kills

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,799
eight

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,880
yeah eight four in the

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,520
top then none in the middle and four in

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,720
a

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,799
in in in a bottom okay

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,960
so for example let's

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,680
put the corner cubes first yes so if i

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,799
have like four cubes there are three uh

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,840
three

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,600
so which one is the

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,040
corner yeah you see these like confused

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,759
cubes so i can

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,520
i can the first how many possibilities i

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,200
can put the first

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,000
corner cube in

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,799
how many oh hey yeah i put let's say i

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,119
put it somewhere here right yeah and

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,759
then i pick another one

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,159
yeah how many possibilities i can put in

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,799
seven seven etcetera yeah okay so how

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,600
many possibilities if i put it on a

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,200
uh

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,880
eight uh lubricant right corner cube

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,399
is it a times seven times six times

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,560
what's this

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,040
i need to think what's this no no you

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,040
don't need to give me a number but this

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,640
is actually bacteria remember this

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,520
bacteria yeah

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,800
okay so the same thing for the education

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,920
h cubes how many possibilities

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,520
is the same yeah the first one is

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,720
yeah how many how many possibilities for

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,920
the adjective if we want to put the

62
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,000
execute i pick the hq yeah take the add

63
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,160
cue

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,760
and if i put the attitude

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,920
this one's poisonous

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,920
i am to put it in one of the 12

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,720
positions and then the second one will

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,920
be 11 right and the third one will be 10

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,800
right yeah so that would be

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,000
1 that would be 12 factorial yeah

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,840
okay so

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,720
so

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,360
so

74
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,599
but the thing here okay there's less one

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,239
more thing is when i put a corner cube

76
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,000
how many possibilities i can twist it

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,519
how many possibilities look i put the

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
corner how many possibilities i can

79
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,480
twist this okay three where that and how

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,120
many possibilities i can twist uh

81
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,599
two way done so so

82
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,599
so for each one right so for each one

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,560
for for each corner cube i can have

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,000
three

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
uh three

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,920
twisting three three configurations so

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,120
that would be

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,040
how many of

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,360
how many of the corner that will be 8 so

90
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,720
that will be 3 2 to the power of a right

91
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,840
and at least this age each edge has two

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,760
right

93
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,200
because look at you can just twist it

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,560
simply simply do this look this is yeah

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,720
twisted

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,280
so that would be two possibilities so i

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,720
time i multiply 2 to the power of 12.

98
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,519
make sense

99
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,480
yeah

100
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,400
okay so

101
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,599
this is the number

102
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,680
that

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,560
this is the total number of different

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,920
ways

105
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,239
i can reassemble this ruby cube

106
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,280
right right you got it

107
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,120
you get it okay so here let me let me

108
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,879
talk about it again okay so this is the

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
number of ways i can assemble this

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,200
lubricant by putting these pieces back

111
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,360
for for this one

112
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,439
square factorial is the number of ways

113
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,360
we can put the hq

114
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,879
a factorial is the number of ways we can

115
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,519
put a

116
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,920
corner cubes but for each corner cube we

117
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,919
can have three twists right that's the

118
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,519
level three to the power of a

119
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,160
for each

120
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,720
for each uh h cube there will be two two

121
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,720
possibilities i can twist the edge

122
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
yeah one way around that'll be two to

123
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,040
the power of two so this is the number

124
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,520
of the total different ways i can

125
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,600
assemble the loop cube but

126
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,680
these are not sometimes it's not

127
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
resolvable yeah do you know what's

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,280
solvable ruby cube and the other one is

129
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,560
not solvable yeah

130
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,560
and only like if you twist the corner

131
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,160
you can't really solve it well done okay

132
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,600
sir

133
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,560
that's here

134
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,160
yeah if i twist it look this one

135
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,440
yeah this bread is supposed to be here

136
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,440
if i twist it

137
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,520
you can't solve it right there's no way

138
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,240
to solve it so

139
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,120
so how many possibilities so how many

140
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,759
these one have three three uh

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,720
twists only one of them yeah only one of

142
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,880
them can be solvable right

143
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,080
this one let's look over here this edge

144
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,080
if i twist the edge

145
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,039
i know but if i this is the complete

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,919
soft softball and then if this is

147
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,240
already soft and i twist twist the edge

148
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,800
it becomes not stoppable right yeah

149
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,800
doesn't make sense

150
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,880
yeah i know but

151
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,400
this is the same thing

152
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,680
right so like only

153
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,240
half of it

154
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,880
is not solvable how is solvable okay but

155
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,880
this one look this one is more tricky

156
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,639
i swap i need to

157
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,160
add this cube

158
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,120
right

159
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,400
back

160
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,360
yeah i put it back

161
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,240
so look i swapped the two edges cube uh

162
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,240
alright this is the this is the thing i

163
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,880
so from a song of a loop cube i i took i

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,759
so what do we do from a song of software

165
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,560
look here we we swap any two pieces and

166
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,720
then let's not becomes an unsolvable why

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,199
is that why is that

168
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,240
so from a silverback do you have a

169
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,639
uh

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,440
ruby cube yeah i mean it's a soft

171
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,080
already and then if we twist if we swap

172
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,560
any two to edge pieces it becomes

173
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,639
unsolvable why is that because you you

174
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,000
can't just walk two

175
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,960
uh two pieces without

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,120
uh without affecting other silver pieces

177
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,120
yeah okay so let's halfway so we need to

178
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,880
divide this by

179
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,080
by 12 right yeah so if we divide this by

180
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,440
12 all right this is the number of

181
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,039
solver

182
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,000
solve the rubik's

183
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,919
state permutation look three of them uh

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,919
one one with us

185
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,080
is solvable because we can't just twist

186
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,199
that we can't we can't just twist the

187
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,800
corner cube

188
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,120
half of it

189
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,400
is solvable because we can't just talk

190
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,240
we can't just solve this uh h cube

191
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,039
and half of these

192
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,000
is unsolvable because we can't just work

193
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,680
yeah

194
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,479
we can't just swap any two pieces

195
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,720
without affecting other pieces

196
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,440
okay so v this number look how do you

197
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,039
pronounce this number a big number

198
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,199
quintillion

199
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,240
this is this number if you calculate

200
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,639
this number

201
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,520
that will give this yeah so what's this

202
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,639
number

203
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:35,199
quantile 43 container 255

204
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:40,759
quadrillion yeah and three

205
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:44,240
trillion 274 billion 489 million

206
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:46,560
850 thousand thousand okay so this is

207
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,520
the number of different states

208
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,160
for

209
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,639
of different possible solvable states

210
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,720
for a lubricant why speak right

211
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,400
can can we use the computers

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,400
to prove us this big number

213
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,400
no right because it's so big yeah look

214
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,400
it's 43 followed by how many digits

215
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,400
oh how many digits

216
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,120
18 digits okay so it's four point

217
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,520
actually four point is around four point

218
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,840
three times ten to the power of eight

219
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,639
nineteen yeah four four four point three

220
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,560
okay

221
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,639
so this is actually quite big number

222
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,919
it's not um

223
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,759
it's not proof possible okay yeah

224
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,039
yeah so okay so what have you learned

225
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,479
today come on mess

226
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,800
a little bit cube how many different

227
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,519
states yeah this is the number okay so

228
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:45,440
queen queen queen yeah

229
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:47,440
4.3 43 companion possible states okay

230
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,320
yeah that'll be for today

231
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,320
good job bye-bye

232
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,040
bye-bye
