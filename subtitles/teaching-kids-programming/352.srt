1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
oh

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,880
hello misery are you right

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,240
yes okay

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,200
so

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:14,639
you know the gene human gene g-e-n-e

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,639
genome human genome

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,480
yeah you must be heard of this before

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,119
genome and dna yeah these keywords

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,119
cumbersome

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,960
okay

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,720
yeah yeah yes

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,239
so

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,399
our human

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,160
you know you know how different people

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,160
look different they have different hair

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,920
colors different eyes right these

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,680
controls by gene right and then we human

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,160
have 23 pairs of chromosomes okay 23

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,680
pairs of tongue each chromosome

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,879
has hundreds of genes right

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,920
yeah hundreds of genes gene pairs okay

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,559
so 23 pairs and one online controls the

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,400
sex the gender right

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,680
for example the boys are ex-wife

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,920
the girls are xx okay

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,840
the girls okay

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,799
the

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,119
boy

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,720
so mommy and daddy

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,920
if mommy and daddy going to have one

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,320
more kid yeah one more one more baby

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,240
so what's the probability of these kids

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,400
being a boy and what's the probability

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,680
of that being a girl remember how do we

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,720
calculate this out we take

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,799
50

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,799
yeah how do we we take one of these and

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,840
we combine with one of these okay so

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,560
what's the probability of x x

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,759
look if we take x

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,960
yeah look at x i pick this x x x x x

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,560
there

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,159
pick this y

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,920
y x

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:55,439
y x right yeah yeah y x y okay so they

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,560
look any x y yeah y x x y is the same

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,200
okay

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,920
okay x y okay so look these two there

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,799
are two four two out of four boys two

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,079
out of four girls okay so

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,680
boy

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,959
boy girls

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,280
50 50 yeah 50 50.

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,480
yeah 23 chromosomes

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,720
one of them

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,680
is controllers

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,080
yeah the sex the gender

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,440
okay so each as i said each chromosome

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,080
has had a thousand you know many many

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,680
uh human genes yeah human genes and the

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,760
genes are

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,480
there there are four types of

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,959
you know you know the dna of dna that is

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,879
the two string two string

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,160
two stranded so you will have these two

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,640
pairs

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,920
jean pairs yeah same pairs

68
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,800
gym pairs

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,080
so it's like a two chain uh two you know

70
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,319
twenty eight pairs

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,400
yeah right i'm just drawing a few okay

72
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,959
it's only a few so

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,200
the these

74
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,200
they we have they only have four types

75
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,040
of gene which is a c g t okay you don't

76
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
need to worry about

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,000
how it pronounced it's just different

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,480
symbol to represent there only four

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,360
types of genes and a always pair with t

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,840
c always pair with z okay so here if it

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,159
is a i just

82
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,959
wanna see what it stands for

83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,799
it's a very very very long you know the

84
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,840
biology terms you know which you

85
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,840
probably don't remember

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,959
yeah we can we can google it later okay

87
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,440
yeah yeah it may be more than 10

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,040
letters okay look if this is a what's

89
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,760
going is going to be

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,319
t

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,720
okay if this is g what's going on is b

92
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,040
c okay exactly so

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,640
what so look it comes with pairs that

94
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,439
means that the dna this dna can be

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,920
can can be easily repelling itself right

96
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,959
right if 109 is broken right this is

97
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,120
broken

98
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,280
right a human body knows because this is

99
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
g so he knows this is c

100
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,200
okay so that's why your human body is

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,720
repairing itself right he knows how to

102
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,040
debate dna right yeah and he cannot take

103
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,720
care not because easily right with least

104
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,759
so it's very uh you know secure way of

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,919
chain right it's match yeah

106
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,079
okay

107
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,639
okay so yeah i'm not an expert on this

108
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,280
biology okay just these these things is

109
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,720
just the basic okay so now

110
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,199
coming back to today's problem we have a

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,080
a gene uh a gene

112
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,240
group okay so look a if i have this one

113
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,199
well let's consider only one side of it

114
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:46,000
there yeah if it is a c c t okay

115
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,360
therefore right if let's consider four

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,639
players

117
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,680
okay that

118
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,360
okay

119
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,960
i write the acct so you know

120
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,000
automatically no no the pair f t g g a

121
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,479
right

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,680
yeah automatically so let's say at least

123
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,080
let's just use the left hand okay

124
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,479
dna comes two pairs you know you might

125
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,840
have other words which is called rna and

126
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,680
rna is only one single

127
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,440
singular okay

128
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,479
so let's say a c c t

129
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,880
and two genes if they belong to the same

130
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,320
group if they only differ

131
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,000
one

132
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,280
one gene for example a c c t and

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,360
a

134
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,050
let's say

135
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
a g

136
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,479
[Music]

137
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,400
c t

138
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,960
that belongs to the same group why is

139
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,960
that because they only differ one yeah

140
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,520
make sense yeah

141
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,039
okay so now if i give i give you a list

142
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,680
of the gene

143
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,600
yeah gene mutation group okay let's say

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,840
gene mutation because they only differ

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
by one and we say that belongs to the

146
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,960
same

147
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,120
gene mutation because look if you change

148
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,039
these to here there will be a mutation

149
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,600
and mutation that belongs to the same

150
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,440
mutation group because it says one step

151
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,560
one difference

152
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,319
makes sense

153
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,280
now okay so i have to give i give you a

154
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,199
look i give you this a c c t

155
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,560
a g c t

156
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,400
and i have given t t c c

157
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,360
how many groups how many

158
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,840
how many gene mutation groups are there

159
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,919
how

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,000
many two right two two yeah because

161
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,000
these two belong to the same these two

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,880
is different so there are two groups

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,080
make sense okay so today's task is this

164
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,160
given a list of genes with the same

165
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,560
length we want to find out how many

166
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
groups are there the mutation group

167
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,759
yeah

168
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,120
make sense

169
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,120
yeah

170
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,840
any idea how can we do it

171
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,440
i mean this is this problem may be a bit

172
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,080
you know think about it

173
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,080
think about it

174
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,039
so look if we can see the leaves as a

175
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,919
note

176
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,880
as no you know grass yes graph

177
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,000
graph

178
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,680
graph graph is the collection of vertex

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,840
and edges

180
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,599
right so if i can have this

181
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,560
acct

182
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,880
as a

183
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,160
node as a vertex

184
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,599
and

185
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,400
a g c t as a vertex

186
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,720
so

187
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,080
and here is another one so i can

188
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,080
consider each gene

189
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,280
is a vertex

190
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,080
right

191
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,280
so is there an edge between these two

192
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
yeah

193
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,319
yeah because they belong to the same

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,199
group right yeah so i i can add an edge

195
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,400
right

196
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,880
right and then there's no edge right so

197
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,280
the problem becomes what we want to find

198
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,440
the number of

199
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,120
number of components the goods for the

200
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,960
graph

201
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,840
make sense

202
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,319
yeah

203
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,639
so our task is to find given this graph

204
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,240
yeah we know how to we given this a list

205
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,319
of genes we know this graph we can

206
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,440
represent the genes in this kind of

207
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,680
graph

208
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,680
and the edges

209
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,680
the edges connected to different

210
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,080
different genes

211
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,919
who are belong to same

212
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,319
mutation group right for example i can

213
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,720
have another one which is what

214
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,039
c g gt right because

215
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,240
these and this only differs by the first

216
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,400
one right

217
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,840
what's this

218
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,440
yeah so

219
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,520
so we can look at the white ball and

220
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,320
then say okay we have two

221
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,159
two components right yeah

222
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,360
make sense

223
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,519
yeah

224
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,880
okay so now we are asking computers to

225
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,880
do it remember

226
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,680
what kind of deck algorithm can we use

227
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
to

228
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,440
translate a

229
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,720
graph

230
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,480
you know we want to find the number of

231
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,040
components

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,000
yeah buffer search and differences here

233
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,240
definite

234
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
you yeah we can do this episode easily

235
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,720
today okay or you can talk about

236
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,519
breakfast therapy and also we can use

237
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,760
the

238
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,600
union fan disjoint graph right there

239
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,120
this joint set remember

240
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,360
this joint set

241
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,640
yeah we could talk about that someday

242
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,160
disjointed union friend so look

243
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,800
for this journal said we have this

244
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,560
vertex we have this statics we find out

245
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,480
they belong to the severity scopes and

246
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,519
we merge these two

247
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,800
right

248
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,360
and then later we find out this and this

249
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,200
belongs to several schools

250
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,480
mutation group

251
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
we merge it

252
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,640
and then we find out and then later we

253
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,560
find out we can just say okay how many

254
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,160
groups how many

255
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,880
connected components are there and then

256
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,600
you can easily tell us that there too

257
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,760
okay so for the default search

258
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,120
for the default search

259
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,360
we try here

260
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,440
we start with any one any node if it's

261
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,160
not being connected right we start from

262
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,360
this one and then we try to visit

263
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,120
and mark

264
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
all the

265
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,680
vertex

266
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,640
yeah

267
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
right

268
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,200
and then we

269
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,600
we mark it and we implement the

270
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,000
answer which is one right look here i'm

271
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
here answer equals one right and the

272
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,160
mark of the connected

273
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,360
okay this is being marked

274
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,120
i skip this is bing mark i skip and here

275
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,720
this is not being marked

276
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,640
not being visited

277
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,279
right and there might be some other

278
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,120
group here which is what ptca okay okay

279
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,839
right and then now i increment the

280
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,120
concept which is two and i mark it you

281
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,959
see that's different yeah

282
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,560
make sense

283
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
all right you're right okay

284
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,640
okay so let's let's do this definite

285
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,720
search today and we talk about breakfast

286
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,959
search this june said some other day

287
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,000
okay because i think deficit is most

288
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,560
easy

289
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,760
to understand today

290
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,680
so define we want to find the number of

291
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,959
groups yeah let's say

292
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,560
five

293
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,600
number

294
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,760
of

295
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,040
groups

296
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,040
and we're given these genes

297
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,839
so in order look for the graph deficit

298
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,839
we need a kind of data structure

299
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,399
remember that nodes we have visited

300
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,800
right what what is it called

301
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,320
that is the the thing

302
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,000
what are the data structure what is the

303
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,160
data structure we use to keep tracking

304
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,680
of the nodes we have visited

305
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,680
so we can remember

306
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,320
yeah loop set okay

307
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,160
so we can say seeing equals

308
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,079
set

309
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,680
uh set will be nothing at the beginning

310
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,680
and then we let's say i have a let's

311
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,640
have a g which is the

312
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,120
uh the gene let's say we put it in in a

313
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,959
set so we can easily find uh

314
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,480
find if a gene

315
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,880
is in the

316
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,760
input

317
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,160
in

318
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,760
by using this hash set lookup which is

319
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,839
one constant right

320
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,399
and now we can do this this define

321
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,880
define step first search and then we

322
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,959
starting with a right

323
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,800
we are now here so and now

324
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,959
here i want to i wanted to say answer

325
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,839
equals link zero okay i know i can say

326
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,720
for

327
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,760
i

328
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,760
in gene

329
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,839
what

330
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,040
if i

331
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,600
not

332
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,560
in sin

333
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,120
and i i need to answer plus equals one

334
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,959
and then that first search

335
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
difference search i okay and then i

336
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,800
write an answer

337
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,240
okay so look

338
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,079
here i i

339
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,800
if i write it here then there will be a

340
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,639
standard template for performing the

341
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,200
definition on the graph right on the

342
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,519
graph look i'm going through this gene

343
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,320
yeah yeah i know i haven't finished yet

344
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,320
for gene genes you can consider it as a

345
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,680
vertex right it's the same thing here as

346
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,519
the vertex

347
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,360
right i'm doing through the vertex i

348
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,560
check if this vertex is not being

349
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,800
visited

350
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,720
then i increment one answer

351
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,399
and therefore search from these right

352
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,639
favorite search

353
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,800
okay so now after this determinants and

354
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,680
that will be the number of the connected

355
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,680
groups now that's research a and then

356
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,600
first first thing i want to add it to

357
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,440
the scene right scene

358
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,160
dot add okay i have visited this a right

359
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,480
and i need to okay so now i have this

360
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,839
gene c c

361
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,320
a a

362
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,160
what's its neighbor what does it what's

363
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,399
what's it connect to

364
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,480
remember we talk about the mutation

365
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,360
group right so the only difference by

366
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,079
one character right so it could be what

367
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,079
c

368
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,360
c will be could be one character would

369
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,440
be one

370
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,920
it could be this could be a this could

371
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,959
be g right this could be t

372
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,000
right

373
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,560
so

374
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,360
so then it's neighbor it's connecting

375
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,800
the vertex it could be a c a a

376
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,920
g c a a

377
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,279
t c a a okay or it could be different by

378
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,399
a here

379
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,279
it could be another one c a c

380
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:07,360
the second character yeah c-a-a-a

381
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,839
c-g-a-a yeah you see c-d-a-a-m-i yeah

382
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,240
because they say look this this one

383
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,000
connects to

384
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,440
which which one the only difference by

385
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,040
one character yeah so we can blue

386
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,120
forcing these because like we only have

387
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,320
four kinds of diff uh

388
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,199
four times of possibility for each

389
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,680
you know gene right so we can

390
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,839
bring forth all its possible neighbors

391
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,880
and then check if it's in the original

392
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,959
team

393
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,399
so let's say for i

394
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
in

395
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,240
range

396
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,240
length a

397
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,320
and then for

398
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,760
x in okay so therefore possibility a

399
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,120
t

400
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,560
c

401
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
g

402
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,839
so what's current c

403
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,800
that's the neighbor the name will be

404
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:04,240
what neighbor neighbor will be

405
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:06,639
a up to i right plus x plus a i plus 1

406
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,560
okay so this this is the neighbor look i

407
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,519
try

408
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,920
i enrange these i try each partition

409
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,880
instead of using the original character

410
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,440
i use the previous one i use the

411
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,079
next and then for this one i brought

412
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,959
forth all four possibilities

413
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,839
yeah

414
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,120
are you okay eric what happened to your

415
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,519
eyes okay yeah

416
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:34,240
and then look if and not even seen right

417
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,279
if this note is not being visited and

418
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,360
also we need to do this end also this

419
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,399
end in already

420
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,120
original

421
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,120
when we do this one left massage

422
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,839
and why

423
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,639
yeah this is the type of search

424
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,639
you see hey

425
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,160
i i i i say it again okay we go through

426
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,639
the genes equals to the vertex okay g

427
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,880
equals vertex g

428
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,199
is the vertex

429
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,079
we go through that vertex

430
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,880
if we haven't visited this vertex we

431
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,120
increment our answer right we have one

432
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,800
more component and we try to mark the

433
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,120
neighbors

434
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,880
we try to visit i definitely search from

435
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,360
i from terminal

436
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,959
so for the first thing we visit this

437
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,079
vertex we have to put it a civilization

438
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,880
in a notebook so so next time we know

439
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,440
right

440
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,480
so next time if it's not if it's

441
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,240
visited it doesn't go in again right

442
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,959
and then we go through like each each

443
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,959
character we try to replace it with all

444
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,079
four possibilities

445
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,240
right and n is the neighbor right and

446
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,360
neighbor is not in sin it's not being

447
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,279
visited and also it's already

448
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
in original

449
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,920
g

450
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,240
and in g right look you can say n in

451
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,839
genes but you if you want to look it

452
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,160
look up find

453
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,040
find the item in a list it takes one

454
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,480
time right so that's why i converted the

455
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,039
list into the

456
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,959
set so that will give me a one to

457
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,559
finding a number in a set time

458
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,600
complexity

459
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,160
a one finding a number in the list time

460
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,559
complexity

461
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,760
it's y above it sorry

462
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,160
um

463
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,640
yeah that's why we convert it to set

464
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,400
right to the test table so if you

465
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,679
provide us okay

466
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,000
yeah so let's let's just search

467
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,280
we can do this another way which is what

468
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,919
so instead of seeing we can go up we can

469
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,080
have a left right so we want to find out

470
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,679
the number of

471
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,679
we want to find out

472
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,360
so this thing is allow us to keep

473
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,440
tracking of the nodes we have visited

474
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,679
and how about let's say we have the

475
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,480
vertex and every time we visit the

476
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,640
vertex we just remove it right remove it

477
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,960
so let's say we can have this

478
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,400
left equals

479
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,280
left equal set gene okay jeans and then

480
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,799
we don't need this uh scene

481
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,039
and then different cells you know we

482
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,400
instead of scene.air we can do what we

483
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,440
can say

484
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,480
left dot remove a

485
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,280
remove a yeah at least it's the same

486
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,679
if then we can say if n not in left

487
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,919
instead of long e c we can combine these

488
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,919
two into one which is if

489
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,400
and not in

490
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,559
if n in left right

491
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,200
okay this is the opposite okay

492
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,200
so look

493
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,400
with the scene

494
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,200
it's is we checking even note

495
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,240
if it's visited if not

496
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,720
then we do the different search which

497
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,799
the left is that if the left

498
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,400
if the note is still in the left then we

499
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,559
do the default search and then here

500
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,679
again if i'm not in scene we change it

501
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,240
if i in left okay

502
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,880
i'm going to do the default search make

503
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,880
sense all right

504
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,840
any questions i mean i mean this is a

505
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,440
little bit too much for you to digest

506
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,559
right

507
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,000
all right

508
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,720
kind of but when you understand the

509
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,720
principle right how how do we do it

510
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,039
okay so how do we do it look

511
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,960
i have a c c t

512
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,720
i have uh

513
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,919
g c c t

514
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,960
i have

515
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,559
t c

516
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,440
a a i have another one c-c-a-a so how

517
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,609
many groups are there

518
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,609
[Music]

519
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,520
so this is the genes of vertex and then

520
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,360
i need to find out which which two are

521
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,080
belong to the same group by differing

522
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,799
one

523
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:45,360
threw at one edge yeah one and this two

524
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,520
yeah dc a8 yeah

525
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,919
right okay so how many groups are there

526
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,799
yeah easy so how do we do it

527
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,520
we start with any vertex if it's not

528
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,240
invisible we incremental answer equals

529
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,960
one

530
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,240
plus one answer and then what do we do

531
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,400
we mark it

532
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,240
visit it visit it

533
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,360
if it's written we skip and then we go

534
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,320
to here

535
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,080
we increment our counter and then we

536
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,120
do the default search

537
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,640
yeah

538
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,080
visit it visit it simple as that

539
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,159
this is the template for the default

540
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,640
search look yeah forget about the genes

541
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:24,960
whatever right the genes the vertex now

542
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,880
the difficulty here is that the graph it

543
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,919
doesn't give you the graph directly

544
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,080
right

545
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,360
all right the difficulty is that it

546
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,280
doesn't give you the

547
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,280
edge directly you need to figure out the

548
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,360
edge right and how do we figure out the

549
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,640
edges here

550
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,480
we try to go through each letter

551
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,320
and then try to replace it with four

552
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,360
possibilities

553
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,760
yeah

554
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,320
yeah if it's already if it's in a gene

555
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,320
now we added there's a edge

556
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,120
so what do we do with we equalize the

557
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,480
edge

558
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,480
what do we do if there is an edge

559
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,240
and then

560
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,000
therefore yeah so it's easy huh makes

561
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,760
sense

562
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,200
okay that's it for today good job bye

563
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,440
bye

564
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,440
bye bye
