problem which you may seem

8
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,760
problem which you may seem
 

9
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,470
problem which you may seem
familiar you know later which is called

10
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
familiar you know later which is called
 

11
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,709
familiar you know later which is called
climbing the stairs

12
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
climbing the stairs
 

13
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,950
climbing the stairs
we climb

14
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960

 

15
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,429

okay so look how many stairs are there

16
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
okay so look how many stairs are there
 

17
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,310
okay so look how many stairs are there
can you count

18
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
can you count
 

19
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,870
can you count
how many steps one two three four seven

20
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:26,880
how many steps one two three four seven
 

21
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,349
how many steps one two three four seven
six

22
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
six
 

23
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:35,590
six
six okay one

24
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600

 

25
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,510

climbing stairs so listen carefully

26
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
climbing stairs so listen carefully
 

27
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,190
climbing stairs so listen carefully
okay so now you're here

28
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,200
okay so now you're here
 

29
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,990
okay so now you're here
[Music]

30
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000

 

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,029

so every time you can climb one step or

32
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
so every time you can climb one step or
 

33
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,670
so every time you can climb one step or
two step

34
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
two step
 

35
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,709
two step
so you can first all nearly bigger

36
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
so you can first all nearly bigger
 

37
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,189
so you can first all nearly bigger
yeah that's okay you can jump here this

38
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
yeah that's okay you can jump here this
 

39
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,349
yeah that's okay you can jump here this
is one way and you can jump to two

40
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
is one way and you can jump to two
 

41
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,190
is one way and you can jump to two
here yeah okay got it

42
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
here yeah okay got it
 

43
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,590
here yeah okay got it
so you can jump here or jump here that's

44
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
so you can jump here or jump here that's
 

45
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,030
so you can jump here or jump here that's
it no more jump three if you want the

46
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
it no more jump three if you want the
 

47
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,550
it no more jump three if you want the
jumpsuit you have the jump here and jump

48
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
jumpsuit you have the jump here and jump
 

49
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,630
jumpsuit you have the jump here and jump
two or jump two and jump one

50
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
two or jump two and jump one
 

51
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,429
two or jump two and jump one
so basically you can jump maximum two

52
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
so basically you can jump maximum two
 

53
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,109
so basically you can jump maximum two
step at a time

54
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
step at a time
 

55
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,109
step at a time
okay so the question is to get to these

56
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
okay so the question is to get to these
 

57
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,590
okay so the question is to get to these
how many ways can you do it so for

58
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
how many ways can you do it so for
 

59
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,149
how many ways can you do it so for
example look here

60
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
example look here
 

61
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,630
example look here
uh maybe if six is a bit more let's do

62
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
uh maybe if six is a bit more let's do
 

63
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,069
uh maybe if six is a bit more let's do
it like uh

64
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
it like uh
 

65
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,190
it like uh
four okay if it's coming at these four

66
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
four okay if it's coming at these four
 

67
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,749
four okay if it's coming at these four
okay

68
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
okay
 

69
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,510
okay
so look you can do this one one

70
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
so look you can do this one one
 

71
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,870
so look you can do this one one
so it's one two three four okay

72
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
so it's one two three four okay
 

73
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,630
so it's one two three four okay
one two three four each time at the time

74
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
one two three four each time at the time
 

75
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,710
one two three four each time at the time
all you can do is one what what what

76
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
all you can do is one what what what
 

77
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,109
all you can do is one what what what
you can do one no you can do two

78
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
you can do one no you can do two
 

79
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,149
you can do one no you can do two
and four okay or you can do two three

80
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
and four okay or you can do two three
 

81
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,670
and four okay or you can do two three
four or you can do one three

82
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
four or you can do one three
 

83
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,870
four or you can do one three
four okay so how many ways

84
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
four okay so how many ways
 

85
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,830
four okay so how many ways
oh you can do i think four

86
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840

 

87
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,190

one two

88

one two
 

89
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,949
one two
four okay one two four yeah that's it

90
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
four okay one two four yeah that's it
 

91
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,869

four two three four
 

95
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,830
four two three four
right one three four okay so there are

96
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840
right one three four okay so there are
 

97
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,430
right one three four okay so there are
five

98
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440

 

99
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,670

so any idea how can we achieve this kind

100
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
so any idea how can we achieve this kind
 

101
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,630
so any idea how can we achieve this kind
of problem

102
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
of problem
 

103
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,430
of problem
remember yesterday we talked about what

104
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
remember yesterday we talked about what
 

105
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:33,750
remember yesterday we talked about what
what

106
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
what
 

107
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,270
what
what's that what did we talk about

108
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
what's that what did we talk about
 

109
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,589
what's that what did we talk about
yesterday dynamic programming to count

110
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
yesterday dynamic programming to count
 

111
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,670
yesterday dynamic programming to count
the number of ways to work in the grid

112
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
the number of ways to work in the grid
 

113
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,430
the number of ways to work in the grid
from the left top left corner to the

114
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
from the left top left corner to the
 

115
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,270
from the left top left corner to the
right bottom corner yeah

116
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
right bottom corner yeah
 

117
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,589
right bottom corner yeah
in order to reach the right bottom

118
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
in order to reach the right bottom
 

119
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,630
in order to reach the right bottom
column

120
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
column
 

121
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,030
column
corner and where could could it come

122
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
corner and where could could it come
 

123
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,309
corner and where could could it come
from is similar

124
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
from is similar
 

125
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,670
from is similar
where could it come from look in imagine

126
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
where could it come from look in imagine
 

127
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,229
where could it come from look in imagine
in a grid

128
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
in a grid
 

129
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,830
in a grid
this is the target this is a destination

130
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
this is the target this is a destination
 

131
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,869
this is the target this is a destination
so before the destination well how many

132
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
so before the destination well how many
 

133
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,790
so before the destination well how many
possibilities

134
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
possibilities
 

135
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,430
possibilities
the of these previous locations how many

136
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
the of these previous locations how many
 

137
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,470
the of these previous locations how many
uh if it's three by three yeah yeah

138
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
uh if it's three by three yeah yeah
 

139
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,990
uh if it's three by three yeah yeah
for example you are starting here

140
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
for example you are starting here
 

141
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,589
for example you are starting here
starting at this point you can only walk

142
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
starting at this point you can only walk
 

143
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,229
starting at this point you can only walk
south

144
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
south
 

145
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,270
south
walk east and work south and to reach

146
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
walk east and work south and to reach
 

147
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,030
walk east and work south and to reach
this destination what's what

148
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
this destination what's what
 

149
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,390
this destination what's what
possible location can it be

150
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
possible location can it be
 

151
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,830
possible location can it be
before reaching this destination

152
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840

 

153
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,869

um yes we're down

154
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
um yes we're down
 

155
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,750
um yes we're down
two okay so look this is the way to

156
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
two okay so look this is the way to
 

157
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,589
two okay so look this is the way to
think backwards

158
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
think backwards
 

159
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,149
think backwards
you see think backwards so in order to

160
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
you see think backwards so in order to
 

161
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,509
you see think backwards so in order to
reach this position you

162
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
reach this position you
 

163
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,789
reach this position you
you can reach here or here right so the

164
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
you can reach here or here right so the
 

165
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,149
you can reach here or here right so the
solution would be

166
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
solution would be
 

167
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,509
solution would be
the sum of these and these right

168
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
the sum of these and these right
 

169
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,910
the sum of these and these right
that's why we will roll a dynamic

170
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
that's why we will roll a dynamic
 

171
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,030
that's why we will roll a dynamic
programming equation

172
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
programming equation
 

173
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,390
programming equation
f and m equals f m minus

174
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
f and m equals f m minus
 

175
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,229
f and m equals f m minus
1 m plus f and m minus one

176
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
1 m plus f and m minus one
 

177
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,070
1 m plus f and m minus one
got it yeah so for this one i'm at stair

178
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
got it yeah so for this one i'm at stair
 

179
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,550
got it yeah so for this one i'm at stair
n

180
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
n
 

181
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,789
n
so where possibly the previous location

182
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
so where possibly the previous location
 

183
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,830
so where possibly the previous location
the one before or t button we're done

184
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
the one before or t button we're done
 

185
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,949
the one before or t button we're done
okay so suppose this is f n

186
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
okay so suppose this is f n
 

187
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,550
okay so suppose this is f n
so it could be coming from f n minus 1

188
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
so it could be coming from f n minus 1
 

189
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:18,870
so it could be coming from f n minus 1
or

190
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
or
 

191
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,189
or
f n minus 2 right and what's this

192
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
f n minus 2 right and what's this
 

193
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,350
f n minus 2 right and what's this
i what how many answers would be would

194
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
i what how many answers would be would
 

195
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,950
i what how many answers would be would
this be

196
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
this be
 

197
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,870
this be
so is it simply equals these plus this

198
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
so is it simply equals these plus this
 

199
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,150
so is it simply equals these plus this
all right yeah and what's this

200
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
all right yeah and what's this
 

201
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,430
all right yeah and what's this
uh what's this we we talked about this

202
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
uh what's this we we talked about this
 

203
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,550
uh what's this we we talked about this
before the one star

204
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
before the one star
 

205
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,749
before the one star
is f what's that fibonacci number

206
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
is f what's that fibonacci number
 

207
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,390
is f what's that fibonacci number
yes fibonacci number okay so look in

208
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
yes fibonacci number okay so look in
 

209
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,590
yes fibonacci number okay so look in
order to get here

210
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
order to get here
 

211
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,390
order to get here
you need to get here oh get here right

212
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
you need to get here oh get here right
 

213
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,350
you need to get here oh get here right
yeah

214
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
yeah
 

215
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,030
yeah
and then what's the terminal condition

216
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
and then what's the terminal condition
 

217
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,270
and then what's the terminal condition
which is f1

218
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
which is f1
 

219
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,350
which is f1
equals one right because in order to

220
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
equals one right because in order to
 

221
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,790
equals one right because in order to
reach one

222
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
reach one
 

223
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,469
reach one
only one way right yes f2

224
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
only one way right yes f2
 

225
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,260
only one way right yes f2
equals one uh

226
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,270
equals one uh
 

227
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,029
equals one uh

229
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,749
[Music]
before all the beginning yeah so how

230
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
before all the beginning yeah so how
 

231
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,510
before all the beginning yeah so how
many ways to come come here

232
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
many ways to come come here
 

233
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,510
many ways to come come here
you can jump two or you can jump one one

234
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
you can jump two or you can jump one one
 

235
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,950
you can jump two or you can jump one one
so it's two right yeah

236
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
so it's two right yeah
 

237
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,550
so it's two right yeah
okay so that's it f1 equals fn minus one

238
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
okay so that's it f1 equals fn minus one
 

239
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,870
okay so that's it f1 equals fn minus one
plus f of minus two which is dynamic

240
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
plus f of minus two which is dynamic
 

241
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,070
plus f of minus two which is dynamic

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
programming
 

243
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,590
programming
got it yeah yeah correct because we are

244
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
got it yeah yeah correct because we are
 

245
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,070
got it yeah yeah correct because we are
we we save this value we need to save

246
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
we we save this value we need to save
 

247
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,070
we we save this value we need to save
the value by implementation okay

248
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
the value by implementation okay
 

249
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,110
the value by implementation okay
so to get it right right to get it yeah

250
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
so to get it right right to get it yeah
 

251
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,270
so to get it right right to get it yeah
look in order to reach jump to this

252
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
look in order to reach jump to this
 

253
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,310
look in order to reach jump to this
point

254
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
point
 

255
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,870
point
you have to jump here or jump here yeah

256
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
you have to jump here or jump here yeah
 

257
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,029
you have to jump here or jump here yeah
because here is one step and here is two

258
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
because here is one step and here is two
 

259
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:39,749
because here is one step and here is two
steps

260
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
steps
 

261
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,950
steps
all right you think it backwards yes yes

262
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
all right you think it backwards yes yes
 

263
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,189
all right you think it backwards yes yes
and then look at n equals f n minus one

264
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
and then look at n equals f n minus one
 

265
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,390
and then look at n equals f n minus one
plus f of minus

266
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
plus f of minus
 

267
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,430
plus f of minus
what's that fibonacci number got it okay

268
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
what's that fibonacci number got it okay
 

269
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,350
what's that fibonacci number got it okay
so now we

270
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
so now we
 

271
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,830
so now we
we we can just implement it very easily

272
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
we we can just implement it very easily
 

273
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,350
we we can just implement it very easily
look one thing

274
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
look one thing
 

275
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,430
look one thing
be fine but but the starting point will

276
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
be fine but but the starting point will
 

277
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,950
be fine but but the starting point will
be a little bit different

278
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
be a little bit different
 

279
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,510
be a little bit different
because fibonacci number the first one

280
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
because fibonacci number the first one
 

281
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,430
because fibonacci number the first one
is zero one and then here

282
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
is zero one and then here
 

283
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,590
is zero one and then here
first one is one two okay so a little

284
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
first one is one two okay so a little
 

285
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,590
first one is one two okay so a little
bit shifting but it's basically the same

286
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
bit shifting but it's basically the same
 

287
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,309
bit shifting but it's basically the same
okay

288
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
okay
 

289
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,430
okay
f n what's missing

290
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
f n what's missing
 

291
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,350
f n what's missing
okay then look if n equals

292
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
okay then look if n equals
 

293
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,110
okay then look if n equals
one return what

294
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
one return what
 

295
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,790
one return what
what one okay if n equals

296
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
what one okay if n equals
 

297
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,870
what one okay if n equals
two between two

298
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880

 

299
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:40,070

otherwise return what

300
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080

 

301

303
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,430

okay so this is basically the fibonacci

304
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
okay so this is basically the fibonacci
 

305
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,430
okay so this is basically the fibonacci
number is that this

306
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:47,440
number is that this
 

307
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,550
number is that this
uh values are slightly different okay

308
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
uh values are slightly different okay
 

309
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,469
uh values are slightly different okay
this is recursion remember we talked

310
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
this is recursion remember we talked
 

311
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,830
this is recursion remember we talked
about recursion

312
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
about recursion
 

313
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,950
about recursion
this is in in efficient the

314
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
this is in in efficient the

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
look remember we talked about this and
 

319
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,510
look remember we talked about this and
the tree each one has two possibilities

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,670
f1 okay f2 equals
f1 plus f0 okay

338
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
f1 plus f0 okay
 

339
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,629
f1 plus f0 okay
look look f1 calculate multiple times

340
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
look look f1 calculate multiple times
 

341
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,510
look look f1 calculate multiple times
again and again

342
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
again and again
 

343
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,950
again and again
remember this three yeah yes

344
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
remember this three yeah yes
 

345
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,150
remember this three yeah yes
and a one square no no no because two

346
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
and a one square no no no because two
 

347
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,550
and a one square no no no because two
each

348
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
each
 

349
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,830
each
is it each end each n

350
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
is it each end each n
 

351
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,110
is it each end each n
chord spawns two so it's all to the

352
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
chord spawns two so it's all to the
 

353
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,749
chord spawns two so it's all to the
power of n

354
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
power of n
 

355
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,950
power of n
this is very in a very in

356
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
this is very in a very in
 

357
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,909
this is very in a very in
efficient but we can all we can put

358
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
efficient but we can all we can put
 

359
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:00,790
efficient but we can all we can put
something

360
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
something
 

361
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,990
something
to speed up to make it a win yeah what's

362
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
to speed up to make it a win yeah what's
 

363
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,029
to speed up to make it a win yeah what's
that

364
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
that
 

365
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,710
that
because we we want it must be slow

366
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
because we we want it must be slow
 

367
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,670
because we we want it must be slow
yeah so how can we speed it up

368
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
yeah so how can we speed it up
 

369
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,790
yeah so how can we speed it up
using a notebook yeah using notebook

370
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
using a notebook yeah using notebook
 

371
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,550
using a notebook yeah using notebook
remember we talked about this many times

372
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
remember we talked about this many times
 

373
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,749
remember we talked about this many times
no book yeah

374
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
no book yeah
 

375
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,430
no book yeah
no book okay and i now look up

376
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
no book okay and i now look up
 

377
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,270
no book okay and i now look up
if if end in notebook yeah

378
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
if if end in notebook yeah
 

379
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,390
if if end in notebook yeah
return notebook n right

380
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
return notebook n right
 

381
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,190
return notebook n right
otherwise value equals left and the

382
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
otherwise value equals left and the
 

383
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,630
otherwise value equals left and the

00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
n equals and put the value into the
 

387
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,029
n equals and put the value into the
notebook and then return what

388
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039

 

389
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,750

and look we don't need to please

390
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
and look we don't need to please
 

391
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,030
and look we don't need to please
implement this notebook

392
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
implement this notebook
 

393
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,750
implement this notebook
manually we can just erase it yeah look

394
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
manually we can just erase it yeah look
 

395
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,350
manually we can just erase it yeah look
we can just erase it

396
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
we can just erase it
 

397
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,310
we can just erase it
and remember the magic keyword remember

398
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
and remember the magic keyword remember

tyson 3.9

404
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
tyson 3.9
 

405
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,030
tyson 3.9
you can you can you can remember this

406
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
you can you can you can remember this
 

407
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,910
you can you can you can remember this
shorter one

408
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
shorter one
 

409
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,790
shorter one
add cache that's it

410
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
add cache that's it
 

411
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,230
add cache that's it
simple simple right so if you please

412
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
simple simple right so if you please
 

413
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,790
simple simple right so if you please
if you please in front of the function

414
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
if you please in front of the function
 

415
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,150
if you please in front of the function
and it tells the computer to memorize to

416
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
and it tells the computer to memorize to
 

417
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,910
and it tells the computer to memorize to
automatically use a notebook

418
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
automatically use a notebook
 

419
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,550
automatically use a notebook
to memorize these values given or n

420
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
to memorize these values given or n
 

421
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,190
to memorize these values given or n
right

422
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
right
 

423
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,389
right
so for example if you calculate f5

424
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
so for example if you calculate f5
 

425
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,509
so for example if you calculate f5
and the next time you're asking for f5

426
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
and the next time you're asking for f5
 

427
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,829
and the next time you're asking for f5
you will automatically retrieve it from

428
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
you will automatically retrieve it from
 

429
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,630
you will automatically retrieve it from
the cache

430
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
the cache
 

431
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,509
the cache
yeah yeah instead of calculating and

432
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
yeah yeah instead of calculating and
 

433
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:39,990
yeah yeah instead of calculating and
again

434
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
again
 

435
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,630
again
again right yeah okay so this complexity

436
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
again right yeah okay so this complexity
 

437
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,790
again right yeah okay so this complexity
is what

438
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
is what
 

439
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,870
is what
i just said it before oh and yeah

440
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
i just said it before oh and yeah
 

441
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,829
i just said it before oh and yeah
because for

442
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
because for
 

443
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,670
because for
if you want to calculate fnd

444
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
if you want to calculate fnd
 

445
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,550
if you want to calculate fnd
that's right if you want to calculate fn

446
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
that's right if you want to calculate fn
 

447
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,590
that's right if you want to calculate fn
and then

448
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
and then
 

449
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,030
and then
how many values you just need to

450
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
how many values you just need to
 

451
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,350
how many values you just need to
calculate f and f n minus one f of n

452
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
calculate f and f n minus one f of n
 

453
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,230
calculate f and f n minus one f of n
minus one each

454
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
minus one each
 

455
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,269
minus one each
f each n value each value each value

456
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
f each n value each value each value
 

457
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,069
f each n value each value each value
from zero

458
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
from zero
 

459
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,389
from zero
from one to n you only calculate once

460
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
from one to n you only calculate once
 

461
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,350
from one to n you only calculate once
right

462
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
right
 

463
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,829
right
yes so that's why that's how we make it

464
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
yes so that's why that's how we make it
 

465
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,750
yes so that's why that's how we make it
fm this is called top-down

466
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
fm this is called top-down
 

467
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,910
fm this is called top-down
dynamic programming yeah because we want

468
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
dynamic programming yeah because we want
 

469
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,509
dynamic programming yeah because we want
to calculate fn

470
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
to calculate fn
 

471
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,630
to calculate fn
so we calculate fn minus 1 and f n

472
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
so we calculate fn minus 1 and f n
 

473
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,949
so we calculate fn minus 1 and f n
minus 2. in order to calculate f of n

474
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
minus 2. in order to calculate f of n
 

475
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,230
minus 2. in order to calculate f of n
minus 1 i calculate f

476
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
minus 1 i calculate f
 

477
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,350
minus 1 i calculate f
minus 2 and f of n minus 3 okay

478
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
minus 2 and f of n minus 3 okay
 

479
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,990
minus 2 and f of n minus 3 okay
but f n minus 2 i have calculated so

480
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
but f n minus 2 i have calculated so
 

481
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,670
but f n minus 2 i have calculated so
this one i don't need to calculate it

482
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
this one i don't need to calculate it
 

483
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,790
this one i don't need to calculate it
again right

484
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
again right
 

485
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,750
again right
top down how about butter up yeah we

486
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
top down how about butter up yeah we
 

487
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,470
top down how about butter up yeah we
talked about that

488
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
talked about that
 

489
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,590
talked about that
as well

490
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600

 

491
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,750

so in order to calculate

492
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760

 

493
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,550

calculator fn right so i i i can

494
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
calculator fn right so i i i can
 

495
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,230
calculator fn right so i i i can
calculate f1

496
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
calculate f1
 

497
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,750
calculate f1
and then f2 and then i calculate f3

498
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
and then f2 and then i calculate f3
 

499
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,790
and then f2 and then i calculate f3
and here i get the fn right yes

500
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
and here i get the fn right yes
 

501
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,990
and here i get the fn right yes
yeah this is called what

502
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000

 

503
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,430

what's the opposite of top down bottle

504
