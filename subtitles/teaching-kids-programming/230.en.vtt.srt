1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,510

hello hello mr area

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,520
hello hello mr area
 

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,630
hello hello mr area
all right yeah okay so today we're going

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:06,640
all right yeah okay so today we're going
 

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,549
all right yeah okay so today we're going
to talk about the multiverse of three

6
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:08,559
to talk about the multiverse of three
 

7
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,470
to talk about the multiverse of three
and seven okay what does it mean

8
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
and seven okay what does it mean
 

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,910
and seven okay what does it mean
for example like if i give you a number

10
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920
for example like if i give you a number
 

11
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,910
for example like if i give you a number
13 and then you can choose

12
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
13 and then you can choose
 

13
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,310
13 and then you can choose
any number of multiple of three and n

14
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
any number of multiple of three and n
 

15
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,310
any number of multiple of three and n
plus any number of multiple seven so

16
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
plus any number of multiple seven so
 

17
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,150
plus any number of multiple seven so
basically we want to looking for

18
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,160
basically we want to looking for
 

19
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,189
basically we want to looking for
three a plus three

20
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
three a plus three
 

21
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:40,549
three a plus three
three four one b no seven plus

22
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559

 

23
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,950

so you can choose zero one two three

24
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
so you can choose zero one two three
 

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,069
so you can choose zero one two three
okay

26
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
okay
 

27
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,069
okay
so you can you need to tell me if it's

28
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
so you can you need to tell me if it's
 

29
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,830
so you can you need to tell me if it's
possible or not okay

30
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
possible or not okay
 

31
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,150
possible or not okay
if it's possible or not so another

32
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160
if it's possible or not so another
 

33
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,310
if it's possible or not so another
example like uh

34
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
example like uh
 

35
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,790
example like uh
eight can you do it with a

36
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800

 

37
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,869

no right that's right so if you tell me

38
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
no right that's right so if you tell me
 

39
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,990
no right that's right so if you tell me
it's false

40
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
it's false
 

41
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,670
it's false
how about nine you say okay

42
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
how about nine you say okay
 

43
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,750
how about nine you say okay
three times three yeah yeah but you

44
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
three times three yeah yeah but you
 

45
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,830
three times three yeah yeah but you
don't need b will be zero okay so you

46
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
don't need b will be zero okay so you
 

47
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,030
don't need b will be zero okay so you
got it

48
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
got it
 

49
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,990
got it
okay so how can we do it everything has

50
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
okay so how can we do it everything has
 

51
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,190
okay so how can we do it everything has
seven times

52
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
seven times
 

53
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,670
seven times
seven times tables or seven three times

54
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
seven times tables or seven three times
 

55
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,990
seven times tables or seven three times
table yeah and okay

56
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
table yeah and okay
 

57
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,749
table yeah and okay
okay how about the mix like ten

58
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759

 

59
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,190

um that's pretty obvious ten three and

60
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
um that's pretty obvious ten three and
 

61
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,670
um that's pretty obvious ten three and
seven

62
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
seven
 

63
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,910
seven
yeah you see so so eat either in three

64
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
yeah you see so so eat either in three
 

65
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,910
yeah you see so so eat either in three
time table or seven times table all the

66
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
time table or seven times table all the
 

67
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,789
time table or seven times table all the
mix

68
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
mix
 

69
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,149
mix
so how how do we check the mix yeah how

70
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
so how how do we check the mix yeah how
 

71
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,190
so how how do we check the mix yeah how
we're checking it so any idea

72
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
we're checking it so any idea
 

73
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,230
we're checking it so any idea
any idea oh if it's

74
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
any idea oh if it's
 

75
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,030
any idea oh if it's
if it's in the ten times table it's

76
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
if it's in the ten times table it's
 

77
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,310
if it's in the ten times table it's
possible

78
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
possible
 

79
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,149
possible
but it's not necessarily the ten times

80
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
but it's not necessarily the ten times
 

81
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,510
but it's not necessarily the ten times
table yes yes

82
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
table yes yes
 

83
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,310
table yes yes
you're right in ten twenty yes of course

84
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
you're right in ten twenty yes of course
 

85
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:52,950
you're right in ten twenty yes of course
yeah because

86
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
yeah because
 

87
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,429
yeah because
i got three and seven and i could i can

88
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
i got three and seven and i could i can
 

89
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,590
i got three and seven and i could i can
just times multiple yeah one two three

90
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
just times multiple yeah one two three
 

91
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,469
just times multiple yeah one two three
four each but

92
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
four each but
 

93
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,550
four each but
how about like the thirteen you know

94
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
how about like the thirteen you know
 

95
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,590
how about like the thirteen you know
thirteen is seven

96
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
thirteen is seven
 

97
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,630
thirteen is seven
plus three times two right yeah so

98
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
plus three times two right yeah so
 

99
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,630
plus three times two right yeah so
that's one that's two any idea

100
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
that's one that's two any idea
 

101
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,229
that's one that's two any idea
um this might not work

102
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
um this might not work
 

103
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,510
um this might not work
but um what but i think

104
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
but um what but i think
 

105
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,350
but um what but i think
it's using trying to do as much service

106
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
it's using trying to do as much service
 

107
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,750
it's using trying to do as much service
as you can

108
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
as you can
 

109
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,790
as you can
yes well i'll try doing as

110
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
yes well i'll try doing as
 

111
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,470
yes well i'll try doing as
seven as we can

112
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480

 

113
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,830

and then we can do another thing we do

114
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840

 

115
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,830

okay it might not work okay

116
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:37,840
okay it might not work okay
 

117
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,910
okay it might not work okay
so wait wait let me find an example yeah

118
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920

 

119
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,190

so are we we want to find the number of

120
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
so are we we want to find the number of
 

121
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,309
so are we we want to find the number of
so we we want to find the number of

122
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
so we we want to find the number of
 

123
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,750
so we we want to find the number of
three and if count

124
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760

 

125
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,509

example yeah i know what i know

126
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
example yeah i know what i know
 

127
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:16,470
example yeah i know what i know
okay example of 16 yeah

128
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480

 

129
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,110

okay so how what's your approach to to

130
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
okay so how what's your approach to to
 

131
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,710
okay so how what's your approach to to
do it it's given a

132
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
do it it's given a
 

133
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,670
do it it's given a
very big number what's your approach

134
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
very big number what's your approach
 

135
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,110
very big number what's your approach
such as

136
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
such as
 

137
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,789
such as
i don't know a hundred can you tell me a

138
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
i don't know a hundred can you tell me a
 

139
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,910
i don't know a hundred can you tell me a
hundred

140
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920

 

141
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,830

it's hard right um seven tens and

142
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
it's hard right um seven tens and
 

143
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,910
it's hard right um seven tens and
three ten easy things yeah yeah

144
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
three ten easy things yeah yeah
 

145
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,589
three ten easy things yeah yeah
okay okay i don't know i don't know okay

146
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
okay okay i don't know i don't know okay
 

147
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:41,990
okay okay i don't know i don't know okay
something

148
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
something
 

149
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,350
something
like something like um yeah

150
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
like something like um yeah
 

151
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,630
like something like um yeah
look now let me just write a recursion

152
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
look now let me just write a recursion
 

153
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:48,949
look now let me just write a recursion
right

154
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
right
 

155
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,710
right
we can check it with this theory you and

156
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
we can check it with this theory you and
 

157
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,589
we can check it with this theory you and
you tell me look eric

158
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
you tell me look eric
 

159
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,030
you tell me look eric
all right f s n if

160
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
all right f s n if
 

161
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,530
all right f s n if
n is smaller than zero will return

162
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:02,540

 

163
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:13,030

[Music]

164
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040

 

165
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,590

return one three

166
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600

 

167
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,789

if and multiple seven equals

168
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
if and multiple seven equals
 

169
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,990
if and multiple seven equals
zero return okay

170
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
zero return okay
 

171
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,990
zero return okay
okay so then you tell me what to do left

172
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
okay so then you tell me what to do left
 

173
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,070
okay so then you tell me what to do left
okay and

174
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
okay and
 

175
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,990
okay and
so the number the number

176
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000

 

177
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,629

so okay so what happened to the number

178
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
so okay so what happened to the number
 

179
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,110
so okay so what happened to the number
so

180
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
so
 

181
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,749
so
return we're done

182
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
return we're done
 

183
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,749
return we're done
we are working on this n so what's the

184
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
we are working on this n so what's the
 

185
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,870
we are working on this n so what's the
problem

186
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
problem
 

187
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,469
problem
so if any of these n minus three and n

188
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
so if any of these n minus three and n
 

189
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,510
so if any of these n minus three and n
minus seven

190
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520

 

191
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,870

is a it's a number a multiple of three

192
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
is a it's a number a multiple of three
 

193
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,590
is a it's a number a multiple of three
and seven

194
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
and seven
 

195
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,749
and seven
then this number must be a multiple of

196
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
then this number must be a multiple of
 

197
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,749
then this number must be a multiple of
three and seven so i'm right

198
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
three and seven so i'm right
 

199
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,870
three and seven so i'm right
right

200
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880

 

201
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,990

yeah look we don't know right all right

202
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
yeah look we don't know right all right
 

203
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,870
yeah look we don't know right all right
we don't know this n but if if this

204
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
we don't know this n but if if this
 

205
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,830
we don't know this n but if if this
number

206
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
number
 

207
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,110
number
all right if it's number is true

208
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
all right if it's number is true
 

209
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,510
all right if it's number is true
or if this number n minus seven is true

210
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
or if this number n minus seven is true
 

211
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,029
or if this number n minus seven is true
then this number is also true

212
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
then this number is also true
 

213
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,310
then this number is also true
i'm right so what

214
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
i'm right so what
 

215
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,749
i'm right so what
if f n minus 3 y f

216
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
if f n minus 3 y f
 

217
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,029
if f n minus 3 y f
minus 7 so what to do

218
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
minus 7 so what to do
 

219
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,870
minus 7 so what to do
what to do here come on

220
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
what to do here come on
 

221
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,350
what to do here come on
come on we should

222
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
come on we should
 

223
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,070
come on we should
what top down remember top down

224
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080

 

225
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,870

dynamic programming top down we are

226
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
dynamic programming top down we are
 

227
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,749
dynamic programming top down we are
working on this

228
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
working on this
 

229
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,469
working on this
number case end listen to me array

230
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
number case end listen to me array
 

231
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,110
number case end listen to me array
you're

232
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
you're
 

233
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,110
you're
losing focus if we are working on number

234
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
losing focus if we are working on number
 

235
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,469
losing focus if we are working on number
n

236
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
n
 

237
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,350
n
but if we know f n minus 3 or f of n

238
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
but if we know f n minus 3 or f of n
 

239
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,309
but if we know f n minus 3 or f of n
minus 7

240
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
minus 7
 

241
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,430
minus 7
if any of them is true then this must be

242
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
if any of them is true then this must be
 

243
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,749
if any of them is true then this must be
true all right

244
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
true all right
 

245
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:15,189
true all right
yeah oh yeah yeah so what's wrong here

246
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199

 

247
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,230

this is a true fourth question

248
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
this is a true fourth question
 

249
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,870
this is a true fourth question
if this is true all this is true so what

250
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
if this is true all this is true so what
 

251
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,909
if this is true all this is true so what
should i put here

252
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
should i put here
 

253
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,469
should i put here
oh come on does it make sense anyway

254
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479

 

255
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,070

that's it we turn this at least go there

256
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080

 

257
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,830

all right okay what's missing here

258
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
all right okay what's missing here
 

259
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,510
all right okay what's missing here
remember yeah cash

260
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520

 

261
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,150

all right listen up okay let me talk to

262
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
all right listen up okay let me talk to
 

263
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,350
all right listen up okay let me talk to
me

264
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
me
 

265
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,830
me
dynamic programming yeah look if n minus

266
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
dynamic programming yeah look if n minus
 

267
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,550
dynamic programming yeah look if n minus
seven

268
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
seven
 

269
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,309
seven
they what's this n minus six

270
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
they what's this n minus six
 

271
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,110
they what's this n minus six
and minus three minus seven right and

272
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
and minus three minus seven right and
 

273
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,390
and minus three minus seven right and
then what's that one three

274
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
then what's that one three
 

275
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,230
then what's that one three
n minus seven minus three and m minus

276
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
n minus seven minus three and m minus
 

277
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,390
n minus seven minus three and m minus
look seven minus seven so look

278
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
look seven minus seven so look
 

279
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,670
look seven minus seven so look
yeah duplicate calculation

280
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
yeah duplicate calculation
 

281
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,029
yeah duplicate calculation
minus different places but but this

282
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
minus different places but but this
 

283
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,469
minus different places but but this
is the same value it calculates

284
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
is the same value it calculates
 

285
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,309
is the same value it calculates
difference so we need a cash

286
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
difference so we need a cash
 

287
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,430
difference so we need a cash
right as long as we need the explanation

288
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
right as long as we need the explanation
 

289
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,029
right as long as we need the explanation
yeah what's the time conversion for this

290
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
yeah what's the time conversion for this
 

291
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,469
yeah what's the time conversion for this
one what's the time complexity

292
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
one what's the time complexity
 

293
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,309
one what's the time complexity
uh come on

294
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
uh come on
 

295
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,920
uh come on
stop stop saying that oh n o

296
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:30,930
stop stop saying that oh n o
 

297
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:39,990
stop stop saying that oh n o
[Music]

298
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000

 

299
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:55,830

it's fine okay this makes sense okay

300
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840

 

301
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,390

how about if we just going through the

302
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
how about if we just going through the
 

303
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,309
how about if we just going through the
number of multiples

304
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
number of multiples
 

305
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,150
number of multiples
very good define f and

306
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
very good define f and
 

307
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,189
very good define f and
look if we're going for i

308
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
look if we're going for i
 

309
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,950
look if we're going for i
in red

310
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960

 

311
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,029

let's say i is the multiple of three

312
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
let's say i is the multiple of three
 

313
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,710
let's say i is the multiple of three
okay yeah

314
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
okay yeah
 

315
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,990
okay yeah
multiple three so you will go to n

316
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
multiple three so you will go to n
 

317
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,469
multiple three so you will go to n
divided by three plus one right that's

318
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
divided by three plus one right that's
 

319
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,869
divided by three plus one right that's
the maximum you can get right

320
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
the maximum you can get right
 

321
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,189
the maximum you can get right
if n minus three times

322
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
if n minus three times
 

323
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,830
if n minus three times
i right if we approve using the i no

324
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
i right if we approve using the i no
 

325
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,750
i right if we approve using the i no
multiple three

326
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
multiple three
 

327
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,430
multiple three
if it can be modeled by what

328
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
if it can be modeled by what
 

329
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,430
if it can be modeled by what
if it can be the

330
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440

 

331
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,389

three

332
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:46,399

 

333
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,630

i is the multiple three if i minus

334
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
i is the multiple three if i minus
 

335
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,590
i is the multiple three if i minus
multiple three i

336
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
multiple three i
 

337
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,110
multiple three i
can modulate by one seven seven yeah

338
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
can modulate by one seven seven yeah
 

339
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,389
can modulate by one seven seven yeah
then we ten

340
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399

 

341
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,430

two

342
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440

 

343
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,030

and ten

344
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040

 

345
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,070

both okay

346
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
both okay
 

347
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,509
both okay
that's it what's the time frame let's

348
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
that's it what's the time frame let's
 

349
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,310
that's it what's the time frame let's
see i

350
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320

 

351
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,110

and what's the space convexity i

352
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
and what's the space convexity i
 

353
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,110
and what's the space convexity i
one yeah we can do at least

354
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
one yeah we can do at least
 

355
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,670
one yeah we can do at least
turning this into one none one none yeah

356
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
turning this into one none one none yeah
 

357
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,030
turning this into one none one none yeah
so we can just say

358
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
so we can just say
 

359
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,389
so we can just say
return any

360
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
return any
 

361
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,030
return any
any means any of these is true any

362
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040

469
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,750

minus ten right if you minus three minus

470
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
minus ten right if you minus three minus
 

471
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,350
minus ten right if you minus three minus
seven that would be minus ten okay

472
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
seven that would be minus ten okay
 

473
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,269
seven that would be minus ten okay
the right on the right yeah

474
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279

 

475
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,710

so you go to the left that would be

476
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
so you go to the left that would be
 

477
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,230
so you go to the left that would be
minus three go to the right that would

478
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
minus three go to the right that would
 

479
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,189
minus three go to the right that would
be minus seven

480
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
be minus seven
 

481
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,030
be minus seven
yeah you're already minus three and then

482
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
yeah you're already minus three and then
 

483
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,790
yeah you're already minus three and then
you go to the left will be minus six

484
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
you go to the left will be minus six
 

485
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,870
you go to the left will be minus six
that's correct if you minus three and go

486
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
that's correct if you minus three and go
 

487
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,550
that's correct if you minus three and go
to the right i'll be minus three minus

488
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
to the right i'll be minus three minus
 

489
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,550
to the right i'll be minus three minus
seven that will be minus ten right

490
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
seven that will be minus ten right
 

491
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,509
seven that will be minus ten right
okay minus ten so if you look at the

492
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
okay minus ten so if you look at the
 

493
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,069
okay minus ten so if you look at the
right

494
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
right
 

495
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,550
right
right note f sixteen minus seven that's

496
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:10,560
right note f sixteen minus seven that's
 

497
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,750
right note f sixteen minus seven that's
f nine right

498
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
f nine right
 

499
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,790
f nine right
and we obviously the nine can be

500
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:14,800
and we obviously the nine can be
 

501
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,189
and we obviously the nine can be
represented by three times three so what

502
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
represented by three times three so what
 

503
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,990
represented by three times three so what
does it mean

504
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000

 

505
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,670

um we can do it by doing that

506
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
um we can do it by doing that
 

507
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,790
um we can do it by doing that
dynamic programming thing yeah yeah yeah

508
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
dynamic programming thing yeah yeah yeah
 

509
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,550

and the cache is to avoid
 

511
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,829
and the cache is to avoid
duplicate numbers yes because we know f9

512
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:31,839
duplicate numbers yes because we know f9
 

513
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,310
duplicate numbers yes because we know f9
we can three times three and then any

514
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
we can three times three and then any
 

515
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,750
we can three times three and then any
number if we can

516
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
number if we can
 

517
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,550
number if we can
if n minus three can be represented

518
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
if n minus three can be represented
 

519
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,910
if n minus three can be represented
right using a multiple three

520
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
right using a multiple three
 

521
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,750
right using a multiple three
seven then this end must be represented

522
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
seven then this end must be represented
 

523
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,230
seven then this end must be represented
by multiple three or seven yeah either

524
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,240
by multiple three or seven yeah either
 

525
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,990
by multiple three or seven yeah either
of these that's why we said all right

526
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
of these that's why we said all right
 

527
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,829
of these that's why we said all right
i'm all right

528
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
i'm all right
 

529
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,069
i'm all right
yeah okay let's see what the time can

530
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079
yeah okay let's see what the time can
 

531
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,310
yeah okay let's see what the time can
practice

532
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
practice
 

533
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,829
practice
and space comes because we only won

534
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839
and space comes because we only won
 

535
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,069
and space comes because we only won
bye-bye

536
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
bye-bye
 

537
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,720
bye-bye
