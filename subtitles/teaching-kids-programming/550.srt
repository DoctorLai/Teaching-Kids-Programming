1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
right

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,220
so we given a list of words like Eric

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,660
rice

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,660
my Ryan

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,960
and and a

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,560
h

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,080
why okay just some random words right

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,960
okay

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,460
n-n-a-r-y is not a word and my name

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,520
needs a capital letter I'll buy the

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,820
small word

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,340
so all these words are in lowercase if

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,920
there are two words contains the same

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,579
characters okay some characters and we

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,059
call it similar Y and and these are

16
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,160
similar even though this has not end

17
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,820
right the lens is different because they

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,820
they are made

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,059
something I made up okay

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,379
and everything lies obviously what do

21
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,939
you call it

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,560
it is

23
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:13,400
I remember last time you tall chocolate

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,740
and it was and you gave the example like

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,360
listening and listen and silence yes

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,619
what do you call it I forgot something

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:26,180
within his a antonym anagram anagram yes

28
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,180
anagram yes good job

29
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:32,340
okay so anyway how do we compare to

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,240
string S1 S2 is Alucard that's a few

31
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:40,020
ways right we can say we can encounter

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:43,020
counter S1 e if it's equal to counter s

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,700
to Y because counter counts the

34
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,700
character and the frequency if there are

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,920
two counters the same then it's a it's

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,619
an angle another way is we'll sort it

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:58,040
right we can say we can sort it

38
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,040
so to S1 is equals to sorted as 2X

39
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,740
yeah for example Eric that's when we

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:10,080
started you become c e i r and this life

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:12,840
we solve it you become c e i r okay I

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,200
said sorry it's elegant when we started

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,000
this if the string is that is n then the

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,980
term lesson oh and okay but if we use

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,260
the counter that stays complexity and

46
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,840
time complexity is over okay so this is

47
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,819
in terms of the term complexity this

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,620
method is faster than less sorting

49
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,280
because o and

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,379
is better than o and again right

51
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,819
and the space complexity this one is

52
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:38,040
aligned because we're using the counter

53
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,620
but this one um told me to use the

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,280
additional space that's our one right so

55
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,980
in terms of space usage the o n is

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,019
worse than a one right when we compare

57
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,900
if the two strings are similar we don't

58
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:55,560
actually compare the frequency r one

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,900
times n one times a one times y

60
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,340
one time and this one

61
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,739
and two times a when times r one times y

62
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,519
one times right because we only compare

63
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:11,459
these it uses the characters n r a y and

64
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:15,480
r a y then we say these two words are

65
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:19,080
similar even this is two times the N the

66
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,900
only one time here make sense Okay so

67
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,659
given this a list of words we want to

68
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,819
find out the number of

69
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:31,319
pairs of the similar strings

70
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:36,540
e r i c r i c this is one path

71
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:38,580
r y a n and n a r y this is another one

72
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:43,260
so there are two pairs if we have

73
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:45,959
another one like e c i r okay and then

74
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,019
how many more pairs do we have

75
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,900
if we have one more string e c i r we

76
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:56,840
could have e i c

77
00:03:51,900 --> 00:04:00,260
easy ir and I see

78
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,260
e-c-i-r okay

79
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,720
okay so the first question how do we

80
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:10,080
compare if two strings are similar

81
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,900
so there's different ways like you can

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,440
sort alphabetically

83
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:20,340
so and and if it's something like an

84
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,220
anagram it it should be

85
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:27,840
I it should be identical to each other

86
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:32,040
so so you know so um that's that's a

87
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,600
pair and and also one way is kind of

88
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,300
like

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,419
um is it value

90
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,340
is it something like was it called

91
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,740
okay so you mentioned about the Sorting

92
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,500
right so look at these two because it's

93
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,380
different than the underground yeah yeah

94
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:53,120
uh is something like a memory serious

95
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:56,160
like you list it like

96
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,699
I think it's a neat enumerate okay

97
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,900
enumerate yes

98
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:06,000
and so if they contain the same letters

99
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:11,220
then they should be the same even if

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,680
they if even if they have different okay

101
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,139
different frequencies okay so look this

102
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,820
is S1 this is S2 actually we can do this

103
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,860
we can use a set filter all the

104
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,340
duplicate characters right and then we

105
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,139
can sort it right sort it the set land

106
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,419
if it's equal then it's similar right

107
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,280
because when we use the set we remove

108
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:32,160
the duplicate numbers and we only

109
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,440
compare the unique characters and once

110
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,199
we do this set we can actually use the

111
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,759
method that we use to check if the two

112
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,680
strings are endocrine so there's

113
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,000
actually one more step just to filter

114
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,660
the duplicate numbers all right

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,759
duplicate characters make sense yeah

116
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,740
Okay so

117
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,620
approvals yeah obviously we can prove

118
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:56,160
also am I right so we're gonna prove us

119
00:05:52,620 --> 00:06:00,120
look answer equals yellow for if n

120
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,860
equals the length of uh right for I in

121
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,180
range

122
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,720
and

123
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:09,539
for J in range

124
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,860
I right so we are checking now we need

125
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,860
to check this area

126
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,940
so if

127
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:27,360
if these Aria and arj are similar so we

128
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,160
can say if set a r r i

129
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,699
actually we can just directly compare

130
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,039
with the set yeah set a uh J right then

131
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,240
answer plus equal one

132
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,160
fixes

133
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,460
that's it return answer this is the

134
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,460
address

135
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:52,740
here is the average length is M okay so

136
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,680
the time connects to be o n times O N

137
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,080
squared times M look why is that here is

138
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,360
n here is Ed

139
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,360
and here we're converting we're

140
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,740
converting each one the length will be n

141
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,220
right

142
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,039
to a set that takes a long time a length

143
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,199
of square comes in okay

144
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,259
makes sense easier

145
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,539
look at the index this is index J is up

146
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:23,580
to index I

147
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:25,919
okay because that's every rice is a pair

148
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,199
but we don't count the duplicate which

149
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,800
is why it's every we only count once

150
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:36,240
right okay okay so that's why the J

151
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:40,380
index looping up to I so when I is zero

152
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,680
this Loop is skipped when I is one when

153
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:47,160
I is one okay the zlo J we don't have

154
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:51,259
any J when I is one the J up to zero

155
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,259
right one I is two

156
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,440
zero one two one I is four

157
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,639
J is zero one two three okay so the

158
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:05,160
index of J is always from zero up to the

159
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,780
index of I

160
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,660
Okay so

161
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,220
this is uh okay you know because this is

162
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,520
very straightforward but we can do

163
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:19,440
better if I want you to come up with a

164
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:22,979
way to identify unique identify like ID

165
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,379
a word based the similarity if we played

166
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,800
out a way to compute the ID the score or

167
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:33,199
you know identity of a word if two words

168
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,199
have the same ID then they are similar

169
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,039
the amount of letters were the same

170
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,039
let

171
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,640
it is like Eric has four letters yeah

172
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,800
yeah but this is also for letters but

173
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,339
obviously the ID of these should be

174
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,580
different right yeah and so I think it

175
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:05,519
should be like the same like letters

176
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,680
some letters as just some letters okay

177
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,680
so we can just do this right so if this

178
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:15,180
is Ash right so we can just do this set

179
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:18,180
yes right and then sort it

180
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,500
we sought it and then we just join right

181
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,560
join it

182
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,860
so this is the function to compute the

183
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,920
ID of each one if two words

184
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,899
have the same ID that are similar right

185
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,800
let's join

186
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,800
are you doing it

187
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,980
okay but whatever you put in the thingy

188
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,800
I see look at this one okay let's do

189
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:51,060
this using this one set the first

190
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,540
operation is set so you become and a uh

191
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:58,200
y right this is the unique right remove

192
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:02,100
the One X or n okay sort it

193
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,260
when we started you become a and uh y

194
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,779
okay only join

195
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,300
right and it will become a and now okay

196
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,820
so this is the ID of that

197
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,200
okay so we try another one side like

198
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:18,000
every variant okay

199
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,339
so what do we have

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,120
is that duplicate numbers yeah I look

201
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:26,640
one way so okay so what first of all we

202
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:32,180
can't do vowels yeah we use the set so

203
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:37,519
but what do we have e r i c

204
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:39,660
y a n okay and then we started

205
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,700
a c

206
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,519
e i

207
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:48,360
and ah why all right

208
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,820
enjoy just put it so this is the idea of

209
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,579
everyone okay so we can have found that

210
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,399
like a equals counter

211
00:10:53,579 --> 00:11:00,779
and we go through this word okay so if

212
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,779
this is the thing yeah

213
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,880
if we have this function identify this

214
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:10,079
ID function this is the S we turn this

215
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:14,600
right return this x equals ID w

216
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:20,579
IDW answer okay answer pivot zero answer

217
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:22,680
plus equal a x Ln a X Plus equal one

218
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:25,560
okay this is very uh interesting here

219
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,560
return a look at return answer

220
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,019
these four we have uh two pairs right

221
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,440
okay look at this example we have two

222
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,440
pairs

223
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:40,579
we calculate its ID right yeah I see and

224
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:46,320
yeah I see the ID would be C

225
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:48,779
e i r okay c e i r answer plus a c i r

226
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,519
see there is no entry C IR in that so

227
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:54,839
answer plus equals zero answer still

228
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:58,019
zero a c i r plus u one so c e i r we

229
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,640
have one entry here one okay okay I see

230
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,640
what I see is the ID

231
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:08,160
let's say right x equals c i r answer

232
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,019
plus a c i r e equals one right so one

233
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,279
pair because originally we meet Eric

234
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,660
before so answer would be one now now

235
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,700
cir

236
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:22,680
increment one so I need to change this

237
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:26,399
to two Okay how I and what's the id a n

238
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:29,040
r y right answer plus a a and now y

239
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,579
there's nothing here so zero but this

240
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:36,720
Loop we need to change it to one so A

241
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:40,260
and R Y plus y okay this one looks the

242
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,060
same yeah plus equals one and then two

243
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,420
days two please two okay so we have two

244
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:49,980
pairs got it yeah yeah look why this is

245
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:53,760
okay I'll show you one example Okay so

246
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:56,579
this a the counter stores the IV

247
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,920
previous number of times of these the

248
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:01,620
same similar string right

249
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,500
okay if this is e I see here and this is

250
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:08,519
also yeah I see here if release is here

251
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,680
okay so now a e r i c that's three times

252
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,899
right now okay

253
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,660
if I had one more year I see how many

254
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:18,600
pairs I already tell you there are three

255
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,880
errors and I have one more array so how

256
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,600
many new pairs can you make the similar

257
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:28,200
strings I think in title you have two

258
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:31,320
typical pears is two and four divided by

259
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,200
two is two four divided by two y because

260
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,440
you said pairs pairs means two and so

261
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,680
okay okay look this is one pair okay

262
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,519
this is one pair yeah yes yeah those are

263
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,279
two

264
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,779
I see no no I'm saying one pair

265
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,779
yeah one pair is like

266
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,160
a pair of shoes oh okay okay so it's not

267
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,560
so yummy fruit

268
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,660
yes a pair of pears

269
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,779
okay come on do you understand this

270
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,060
question at least

271
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:05,880
and I have one more area coming how many

272
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:08,459
new pairs of the similar string can we

273
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,100
get I have one more Eric so this area

274
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:13,320
can pair with this one compared with

275
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,639
this one compared with this one How many

276
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,079
pairs three so eighty three yeah

277
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,600
okay and then Eric there are four Eric

278
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,820
now I have another area coming how many

279
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,680
new players can we have okay for plus

280
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,459
this number right look this is what it

281
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,660
is look answer plus already and we

282
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,360
incremented

283
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,700
makes sense but it makes sense now

284
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,220
yeah this is ideal okay so which one is

285
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,500
simpler The Messer which one is simpler

286
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,019
this one you understand this and the

287
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,079
previous one is the profile

288
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:48,600
they are n words how many pairs you know

289
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,120
without considering the similarity they

290
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,160
are n apples How many pairs can you make

291
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,920
without consistently sequence picking

292
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:59,820
two out of n look picking two out of n

293
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,980
what's this cn2 this is equals n times n

294
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,560
minus 1 divided by two

295
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,199
four How many pairs four times three

296
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,839
divided by two let's

297
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,079
um six four is one two three four right

298
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,500
so you pick two one two one three one

299
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:19,560
four two three two four three four five

300
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,839
this is the sixth C and two picking two

301
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,540
out of ten okay so proof of the console

302
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,760
is the answer okay the last uh method I

303
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,300
want to mention is based on this this is

304
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,459
ID right not ID function uh ID we use

305
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,339
this function to calculate and if it's

306
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:37,139
only lowercase if it's lowercase we can

307
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,660
change this IV to a better one because

308
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,880
the ID is uh

309
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,060
he's a lowercase character and we could

310
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:48,240
talk about the ASCII right aaci let's

311
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:52,019
ask it for the a

312
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,180
o r b a what do we have anybody remember

313
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:57,779
the magic number

314
00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,360
the lowercase a and the bigger case a

315
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:02,459
do you still remember asking asei

316
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,079
American

317
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:06,079
um I don't know exchange information

318
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:15,600
so lowercase 65. uppercase is 97. right

319
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:20,279
that's that's the location yeah yeah

320
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,279
okay and then you said uh is

321
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,699
[Music]

322
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:29,120
48 okay

323
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:32,459
and the space

324
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,860
okay okay you're not lucky there's an

325
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:37,199
Enter key right Enter key

326
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,120
I'm lucky this is 13 and then it's a

327
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:43,380
space key

328
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:47,459
space this is 32 okay

329
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:49,019
the mapping from the keys yeah a lot is

330
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,060
to calculate this number from the

331
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:54,420
character and the opposite would be c h

332
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:56,820
r so if we say chr97 you give us a

333
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,000
little bit eight but I think it's all

334
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:02,880
lower case then we can use the feed mask

335
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,699
asking master so we can think of a big

336
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,540
integer and

337
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:14,939
if this is hey hey this is zero okay P

338
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:17,459
then is one C is two t is three e is

339
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:20,100
four right so if it's an integer right

340
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:23,160
if it's an integer

341
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:26,880
finally remember integer this is a this

342
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,220
is B this is C this is C this is e okay

343
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,220
so if we have e then we set this to one

344
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,059
okay if we have this R we set this to

345
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,880
one

346
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:38,640
if we have I we set the I to one okay

347
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,120
simple as that c set to one okay and

348
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,559
then we are transforming the words into

349
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,080
a number

350
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:51,559
that's what we are doing okay so now we

351
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:59,700
can do this uh one shift shifter

352
00:17:51,559 --> 00:18:01,919
ORD W minus 97 5 and then four W in what

353
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:07,860
but we have to reduce this function okay

354
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:10,020
W in words word actually in word okay

355
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,580
so this is I'm talking about this work

356
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,740
okay well

357
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,140
I know we can use this reduce function

358
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,500
reduce

359
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:21,299
uh oh ah like that okay so the reduce

360
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,160
function basically you're saying that I

361
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,200
want to apply at least the first

362
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,260
function which is all

363
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,240
in the second iterator okay we don't

364
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:35,640
need to go into details here but

365
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:40,380
basically this is a complete the ideal

366
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:44,039
of Ln for R for w in the word and two

367
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:48,000
lists uh IB equals ID or

368
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:50,160
least speed 150 50. a lot if it's a then

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,200
we shift the zero position if it is Z

370
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,980
then we shift to 25 to the left okay

371
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,500
this is more fancy syntax because it

372
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:01,500
allow us to transform the the word using

373
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,740
the bit bit masking

374
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,880
mask then we have a transform basically

375
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,940
we'll choose among the lowercase

376
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,679
characters uh into a big integer and

377
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,419
then we can compare two integer if the

378
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,820
two integers are the same and we say

379
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:16,500
these two words are similar okay and

380
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,900
it's basically a based on this one and

381
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,660
the time complexity let's analyze this a

382
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,660
little bit okay so this is n right o n

383
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:28,260
let's face complexity o n this function

384
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,500
is W so o n times n right and that's it

385
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,500
look

386
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,600
because that's easy to come up with and

387
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,240
we talk about the Improvement look this

388
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,059
is our one right and the ID function is

389
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,400
omo right so earn times n the space

390
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,260
complex division the counter okay let's

391
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:04,269
see okay what have you learned today

392
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,269
[Music]

393
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,380
we have a

394
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,080
similar like letters in them and you

395
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:16,020
call them similar

396
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,360
yeah okay so which method can you

397
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,039
explain to me how many messages do we

398
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,620
have to talk about three

399
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:24,720
yes to be exactly happy but the third

400
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,600
one is based on the second one just the

401
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,720
ID function we improve it okay four

402
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,419
apples picking two letters how many ways

403
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,640
yeah six pairs right two right so we can

404
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,440
prove us yeah we can prove us and then

405
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,120
we check if the two words are similar

406
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,980
right how do we check if two words as

407
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,080
middle uh we just converted to set and

408
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,360
that's it right because that only stores

409
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,280
the unique numbers that do not care how

410
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,780
many times they appear right okay let's

411
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,780
say for the day bye-bye bye
