1
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,310

yeah okay okay so today we talk about

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,320
yeah okay okay so today we talk about
 

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,230
yeah okay okay so today we talk about
your life string yeah ss0 and s1

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
your life string yeah ss0 and s1
 

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,510
your life string yeah ss0 and s1
we want to check if s1 can be obtained

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
we want to check if s1 can be obtained
 

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:17,830
we want to check if s1 can be obtained
by

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
by
 

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,790
by
deleting or removing one character from

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
deleting or removing one character from
 

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,750
deleting or removing one character from
s0

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
s0
 

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,029
s0
for example s0 is a b c and and

14
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:25,039
for example s0 is a b c and and
 

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,150
for example s0 is a b c and and
s1 is ac then you need to tell me is

16
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
s1 is ac then you need to tell me is
 

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,349
s1 is ac then you need to tell me is
true

18
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
true
 

19
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,750
true
all right because if we remove the b

20
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
all right because if we remove the b
 

21
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,990
all right because if we remove the b
from s zero array

22
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
from s zero array
 

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,190
from s zero array
yeah now we can obtain ac right

24
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
yeah now we can obtain ac right
 

25
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,790
yeah now we can obtain ac right
okay yeah this is easy easy okay

26
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
okay yeah this is easy easy okay
 

27
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,549
okay yeah this is easy easy okay
and how about it look if it's a b c d

28
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
and how about it look if it's a b c d
 

29
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,470
and how about it look if it's a b c d
and if can you be removed as a b

30
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,480
and if can you be removed as a b
 

31
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,110
and if can you be removed as a b
you need to tell me no why is that

32
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
you need to tell me no why is that
 

33
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,029
you need to tell me no why is that
because you're relieving t

34
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
because you're relieving t
 

35
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,110
because you're relieving t
yeah because the difference yes so first

36
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
yeah because the difference yes so first
 

37
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,630
yeah because the difference yes so first
of all we need to check the difference

38
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
of all we need to check the difference
 

39
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,189
of all we need to check the difference
if we it's

40
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
if we it's
 

41
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,069
if we it's
one right yeah if the length of the

42
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
one right yeah if the length of the
 

43
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,869
one right yeah if the length of the
difference

44
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
difference
 

45
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,029
difference
is more than one certainly we can't

46
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
is more than one certainly we can't
 

47
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,390
is more than one certainly we can't
right

48
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
right
 

49
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,910
right
this makes sense over this

50
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
this makes sense over this
 

51
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,350
this makes sense over this
a b c d and then you tell me if it's a

52
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
a b c d and then you tell me if it's a
 

53
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,280
a b c d and then you tell me if it's a
b c

54
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,290
b c
 

55
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,109

00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
f no why is that i can't see
 

59
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:36,550
f no why is that i can't see
because that isn't coin

60
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560

 

61
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,990

every good possibility

62
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
every good possibility
 

63
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,030
every good possibility
idea so so first of all we can

64
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
idea so so first of all we can
 

65
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,510
idea so so first of all we can
remove any of these and then we check if

66
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
remove any of these and then we check if
 

67
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,749
remove any of these and then we check if
it is the same as the other one right

68
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
it is the same as the other one right
 

69
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,429
it is the same as the other one right
yes all right but first of all we need

70
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
yes all right but first of all we need
 

71
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:51,990
yes all right but first of all we need
to check

72
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
to check
 

73
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,910
to check
if the length is the length is the

74
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
if the length is the length is the
 

75
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,870
if the length is the length is the
uh if the length is the difference than

76
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
uh if the length is the difference than
 

77
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,510
uh if the length is the difference than
one right

78
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
one right
 

79
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,190
one right
i'm right yeah okay now let's try the

80
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,200
i'm right yeah okay now let's try the
 

81
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,190
i'm right yeah okay now let's try the
fruitful thing first okay

82
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
fruitful thing first okay
 

83
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,510
fruitful thing first okay
how can we blow first hurry let's just

84
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
how can we blow first hurry let's just
 

85
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,510
how can we blow first hurry let's just
tell you

86
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
tell you
 

87
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,110
tell you
if i check if this is s0

88
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
if i check if this is s0
 

89
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,710
if i check if this is s0
uh s1 if you want to check if s removing

90
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
uh s1 if you want to check if s removing
 

91
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,670
uh s1 if you want to check if s removing
one from the

92
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
one from the
 

93
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,949
one from the
s0 can become s1 okay so let's say

94
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
s0 can become s1 okay so let's say
 

95
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,150
s0 can become s1 okay so let's say
a b l l

96
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
a b l l
 

97
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,270
a b l l
let's say the lens okay lens 0

98
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
let's say the lens okay lens 0
 

99
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,670
let's say the lens okay lens 0
lens 1 equals lens s0

100
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
lens 1 equals lens s0
 

101
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,030
lens 1 equals lens s0
lens s1 why okay so

102
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
lens s1 why okay so
 

103
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,589
lens s1 why okay so
can you tell me how can i write this if

104
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
can you tell me how can i write this if
 

105
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,670
can you tell me how can i write this if
if

106
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
if
 

107
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,589
if
if what if we remove one character from

108
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
if what if we remove one character from
 

109
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,190
if what if we remove one character from
s zero

110
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
s zero
 

111
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,670
s zero
so we need to check if the difference so

112
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
so we need to check if the difference so
 

113
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,509
so we need to check if the difference so
s0 is now

114
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
s0 is now
 

115
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,910
s0 is now
i just take put it here as you know

116
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
i just take put it here as you know
 

117
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,630
i just take put it here as you know
advanced

118
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
advanced
 

119
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,790
advanced
so if n 0 not equals

120
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800

 

121
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,830

l 1 what minus 1

122
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
l 1 what minus 1
 

123
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,190
l 1 what minus 1
which one is bigger s0 is bigger

124
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
which one is bigger s0 is bigger
 

125
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,309
which one is bigger s0 is bigger
okay then we return what we tend

126
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
okay then we return what we tend
 

127
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,949
okay then we return what we tend
yeah first okay so you said saying i

128
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
yeah first okay so you said saying i
 

129
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,589
yeah first okay so you said saying i
want to

130
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
want to
 

131
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,710
want to
check removing every character uh how

132
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
check removing every character uh how
 

133
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,550
check removing every character uh how
many possibilities of removing one

134
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
many possibilities of removing one
 

135
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,949
many possibilities of removing one
character from seo

136
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
character from seo
 

137
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,430
character from seo
zero zero yeah okay yeah four

138
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
zero zero yeah okay yeah four
 

139
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,309
zero zero yeah okay yeah four
i in range

140
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319

 

141
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,869

l zero okay and zero i want to remove

142
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
l zero okay and zero i want to remove
 

143
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,070
l zero okay and zero i want to remove
the index at i

144
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
the index at i
 

145
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,110
the index at i
right so let's say this new character

146
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
right so let's say this new character
 

147
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,070
right so let's say this new character
new new string

148
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
new new string
 

149
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,229
new new string
s equals s zero

150
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239

 

151
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,309

how how can i write it up to

152
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
how how can i write it up to
 

153
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,509
how how can i write it up to
i want to remove the index look eric

154
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
i want to remove the index look eric
 

155
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,630
i want to remove the index look eric
a b c b okay so look i will be

156
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
a b c b okay so look i will be
 

157
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,670
a b c b okay so look i will be
zero if i want to remove remove the a so

158
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
zero if i want to remove remove the a so
 

159
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,309
zero if i want to remove remove the a so
that

160
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
that
 

161
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,630
that
the index will be one i

162
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
the index will be one i
 

163
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,830
the index will be one i
plus s i

164
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
plus s i
 

165
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,869
plus s i
plus one right so when s is i

166
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
plus one right so when s is i
 

167
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,270
plus one right so when s is i
zero you become this b c d when i is one

168
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
zero you become this b c d when i is one
 

169
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,429
zero you become this b c d when i is one
will become y y i is one it would be

170
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
will become y y i is one it would be
 

171
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,710
will become y y i is one it would be
a c d okay then

172
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
a c d okay then
 

173
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,550
a c d okay then
if x equal equal one

174
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560

 

175
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,749

i remove one character from

176
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
i remove one character from
 

177
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,749
i remove one character from
the s yellow and i want to check if it's

178
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
the s yellow and i want to check if it's
 

179
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,150
the s yellow and i want to check if it's
the same as what

180
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
the same as what
 

181
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,670
the same as what
if it's the same as which can which

182
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
if it's the same as which can which
 

183
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,870
if it's the same as which can which
string

184
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880

 

185
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:50,280

which which is string come on

186
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,290

 

187

[Music]
 

189
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,230
[Music]
okay and after this we return

190
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240

 

191
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,629

what's the term complexity area

192
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639

 

193
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,070

this is if this the length is n yeah

194
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
this is if this the length is n yeah
 

195
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,950
this is if this the length is n yeah
this is o n here and here

196
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
this is o n here and here
 

197
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,909
this is o n here and here
no no no why is it cube n squared oh n

198
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
no no no why is it cube n squared oh n
 

199
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,749
no no no why is it cube n squared oh n
squared here's always exactly what i

200
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
squared here's always exactly what i
 

201
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,950
squared here's always exactly what i
said

202
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
said
 

203
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,670
said
yeah look at o n times o n right the

204
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
yeah look at o n times o n right the
 

205
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,830
yeah look at o n times o n right the
chicken is exactly what i did

206
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
chicken is exactly what i did
 

207
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:35,510
chicken is exactly what i did
yes okay

208
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520

 

209
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,590

does it make sense here yeah does it

210
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
does it make sense here yeah does it
 

211
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,550
does it make sense here yeah does it
make sense

212
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
make sense
 

213
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,830
make sense
look if i equals two zero one two

214
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
look if i equals two zero one two
 

215
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,950
look if i equals two zero one two
alright

216
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
alright
 

217
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,990
alright

s0 2 plus
 

219
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,430
s0 2 plus
s3 what does it mean s02

220
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
s3 what does it mean s02
 

221
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,629
s3 what does it mean s02
all right look at me i am

00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
all right look at me i am
 

223
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,150
all right look at me i am
what's s 0 after 2 if s 0 is a b

224
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
what's s 0 after 2 if s 0 is a b
 

225
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,350
what's s 0 after 2 if s 0 is a b
c d 0 1 2 s

s 0 up to 2 what does it mean

228
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
s 0 up to 2 what does it mean
 

229
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,830
s 0 up to 2 what does it mean
it means it's a b c i think a b

230
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
it means it's a b c i think a b
 

231
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,430
it means it's a b c i think a b
up to c not including c plus s three is

232
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
up to c not including c plus s three is
 

233
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,350
up to c not including c plus s three is
what

234
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
what
 

235
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,189
what
zero one two three s three is what b c d

236
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
zero one two three s three is what b c d
 

237
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,029
zero one two three s three is what b c d
three start from three a b c d e a b c d

238
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
three start from three a b c d e a b c d
 

239
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,510
three start from three a b c d e a b c d
start from three characters three what's

240
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
start from three characters three what's
 

241
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,309
start from three characters three what's
what's three

242
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
what's three
 

243
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,990
what's three
cd zero one two three

244
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
cd zero one two three
 

245
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,189
cd zero one two three
what's s3 start from three

246
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
what's s3 start from three
 

247
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,390
what's s3 start from three
zero one two three what's three yeah b

248
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
zero one two three what's three yeah b
 

249
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,830
zero one two three what's three yeah b
and start from t which is what b

250
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
and start from t which is what b
 

251
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,309
and start from t which is what b
so you add it together is a b d that's

252
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
so you add it together is a b d that's
 

253
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,350
so you add it together is a b d that's
what it means by

254
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
what it means by
 

255
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,950
what it means by
deleting character c got it yeah

256
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
deleting character c got it yeah
 

257
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,350
deleting character c got it yeah
that's why it means i and i it's away

258
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
that's why it means i and i it's away
 

259
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,790
that's why it means i and i it's away
from zero to

260
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
from zero to
 

261
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,710
from zero to
the length of seo let's let's

262
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
the length of seo let's let's
 

263
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,029
the length of seo let's let's
let's hope we're removing one character

264
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
let's hope we're removing one character
 

265
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,270
let's hope we're removing one character
blue forcing removing one character from

266
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
blue forcing removing one character from
 

267
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,589
blue forcing removing one character from
from s0 and we check if it's the same as

268
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
from s0 and we check if it's the same as
 

269
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,189
from s0 and we check if it's the same as
another one right

270
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
another one right
 

271
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,270
another one right
got it this makes sense

272
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
got it this makes sense
 

273
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,990
got it this makes sense
you sure okay are you sure

274
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
you sure okay are you sure
 

275
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,990
you sure okay are you sure
you're sure really i need anything

276
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
you're sure really i need anything
 

277
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,870
you're sure really i need anything
else no no this is o n square so i'm

278
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
else no no this is o n square so i'm
 

279
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,629
else no no this is o n square so i'm
going to introduce you

280
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
going to introduce you
 

281
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,749
going to introduce you
to the o and o

282
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
to the o and o
 

283
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,990
to the o and o
right okay remember a few weeks ago we

284
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
right okay remember a few weeks ago we
 

285
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,070
right okay remember a few weeks ago we
talked about the subsequence

286
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
talked about the subsequence
 

287
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,070
talked about the subsequence
and subsequent what's the subsequence

288
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
and subsequent what's the subsequence
 

289
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,350
and subsequent what's the subsequence
that's like a bit of thing you know

290
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
that's like a bit of thing you know
 

291
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,469
that's like a bit of thing you know
like you know a b c d

292
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
like you know a b c d
 

293
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,270
like you know a b c d
e island

294
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
e island
 

295
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,469
e island
a c e

296
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
a c e
 

297
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,830
a c e
is ac a subsequent of abcde oh no it's

298
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
is ac a subsequent of abcde oh no it's
 

299
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,309
is ac a subsequent of abcde oh no it's
not

300
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
not
 

301
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,430
not
it is subsequent so basically you

302
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
it is subsequent so basically you
 

303
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,469
it is subsequent so basically you
removed

304
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
removed
 

305
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,270
removed
one or more eric you remove zero or more

306
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
one or more eric you remove zero or more
 

307
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,629
one or more eric you remove zero or more
characters from this string and it

308
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
characters from this string and it
 

309
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,230
characters from this string and it
becomes a sunscreen okay

310
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
becomes a sunscreen okay
 

311
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,589
becomes a sunscreen okay
look a ce but is it

312
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
look a ce but is it
 

313
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,790
look a ce but is it
c e a a subsequence or least no why is

314
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
c e a a subsequence or least no why is
 

315
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,189
c e a a subsequence or least no why is
that

316
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
that
 

317
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,510
that
oh because they're in the wrong order

318
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
oh because they're in the wrong order
 

319
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,309
oh because they're in the wrong order
you know

320
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
you know
 

321
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:24,830
you know
okay so another one another one

322
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840

 

323
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,869

lucky it's 268 of sequence

324
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
lucky it's 268 of sequence
 

325
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,469
lucky it's 268 of sequence
2 3 4 6 7

326
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479

327
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,430
2 3 4 6 7
7 8. is this a subsequence of them

328
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
7 8. is this a subsequence of them
 

329
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,190
7 8. is this a subsequence of them
why is that yeah so okay so

330
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
why is that yeah so okay so
 

331
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,509
why is that yeah so okay so
it's uh yeah so how we checking this if

332
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
it's uh yeah so how we checking this if
 

333
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,230
it's uh yeah so how we checking this if
s 0 is subsequent of s1

334
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
s 0 is subsequent of s1
 

335
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,710
s 0 is subsequent of s1
all right do you still remember how do

336
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
all right do you still remember how do
 

337
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,389
all right do you still remember how do
we check is

338
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
we check is
 

339
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,269
we check is
is the subsequent of s1 so

340
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279

 

341
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,430

we move both if not the same we only

342
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
we move both if not the same we only
 

343
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,509
we move both if not the same we only
move one yeah right

344
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
move one yeah right
 

345
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,430
move one yeah right
oh you still remember this wow all right

346
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
oh you still remember this wow all right
 

347
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,430
oh you still remember this wow all right
to my surprise okay okay let's let's

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,910
is
spawning the first one j is pointing the

394
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
spawning the first one j is pointing the
 

395
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,710
spawning the first one j is pointing the
first one of

first one of
 

397
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,069
first one of
this one right all right yeah so

398
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
this one right all right yeah so
 

399
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,910
this one right all right yeah so
why are i smaller than

400
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
why are i smaller than
 

401
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,190
why are i smaller than
what l a and zero and

402
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
what l a and zero and
 

403
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,150
what l a and zero and
one and what and j smaller than

404
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
one and what and j smaller than
 

405
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,230
one and what and j smaller than
l1 yeah okay now look

406
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
l1 yeah okay now look
 

407
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,509
l1 yeah okay now look
if if s s 0

408
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
if if s s 0
 

409
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,269
if if s s 0
i equals equals s1

410
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
i equals equals s1
 

411
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,550
i equals equals s1
what if this is the same what happened

412
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
what if this is the same what happened
 

413
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,750
what if this is the same what happened
j i know what happened yeah

414
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
j i know what happened yeah
 

415
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,829
j i know what happened yeah
i i plus equals one right

416
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839

 

417
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:06,710

yes

418
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720

 

419
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,110

we need to increment which character if

420
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
we need to increment which character if
 

421
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,069
we need to increment which character if
it is not the same

422
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
it is not the same
 

423
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,300
it is not the same
let's say if this is bcd we only

424
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,310
let's say if this is bcd we only
 

425
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:27,110
let's say if this is bcd we only

427
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,310

equals if

428
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
equals if
 

429
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,110
equals if
if i points into the last one then we

430
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
if i points into the last one then we
 

431
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,230
if i points into the last one then we
follow the match right

432
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
follow the match right
 

433
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,389
follow the match right
yeah so return i equals equal

434
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
yeah so return i equals equal
 

435
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,230
yeah so return i equals equal
zero okay so while this is the

436
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
zero okay so while this is the
 

437
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,710
zero okay so while this is the
review of the subsequence why i'm

438
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
review of the subsequence why i'm
 

439
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,310
review of the subsequence why i'm
talking about this

440
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
talking about this
 

441
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,829
talking about this
all right so if we know

442
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
all right so if we know
 

443
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,750
all right so if we know
this we it is more more chance of

444
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
this we it is more more chance of
 

445
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,110
this we it is more more chance of
it'll be much easier to understand v uh

446
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
it'll be much easier to understand v uh
 

447
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,470
it'll be much easier to understand v uh
you know one before that's what i said

448
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
you know one before that's what i said
 

449
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,389
you know one before that's what i said
so in first of all we check the length

450
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
so in first of all we check the length
 

451
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,990
so in first of all we check the length
right they need to be

452
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
right they need to be
 

453
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,790
right they need to be
still need to be one letter more than s1

454
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
still need to be one letter more than s1
 

455
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,590
still need to be one letter more than s1
right

456
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
right
 

457
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,230
right
if it's one letter more then we check if

458
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
if it's one letter more then we check if
 

459
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,590
if it's one letter more then we check if
s zero

460
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
s zero
 

461
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,350
s zero
is the subsequence of f1 right yeah

462
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
is the subsequence of f1 right yeah
 

463
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,629
is the subsequence of f1 right yeah
does it make sense so yeah here

464
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
does it make sense so yeah here
 

465
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,269
does it make sense so yeah here
then we look so suppose we have this

466
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
then we look so suppose we have this
 

467
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,829
then we look so suppose we have this
angle yeah

468
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
angle yeah
 

469
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,230
angle yeah
yeah all right

470
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
yeah all right
 

471
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,590
yeah all right
so how how do we implement this check

472
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
so how how do we implement this check
 

473
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,310
so how how do we implement this check
x0 x1 right

474
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
x0 x1 right
 

475
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,670
x0 x1 right
if length is 0

okay one one way of doing this is to

okay one one way of doing this is to
compare character by character

498
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
compare character by character
 

499
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,670
compare character by character
is a equals a of course yeah it's

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680

 

501
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,910

okay so in this case what we need to

502
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
okay so in this case what we need to
 

503
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,710
okay so in this case what we need to
check

504
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
check
 

505
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,629
check
if this one is bigger so what does it

506
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
if this one is bigger so what does it
 

507
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,389
if this one is bigger so what does it
mean it means that

508
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
mean it means that
 

509
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,470
mean it means that
this part should be equal to this part

510
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
this part should be equal to this part
 

511
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,150
this part should be equal to this part
right okay

512
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
right okay
 

513
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,350
right okay
right am i right

514
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
right am i right
 

515
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,110
right am i right
does it make sense look because we know

516
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
does it make sense look because we know
 

517
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,790
does it make sense look because we know
this this string is one more one

518
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
this this string is one more one
 

519
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,470
this this string is one more one
character than that right

520
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480
character than that right
 

521
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,269
character than that right
so if this is a mismatch c is not equal

522
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
so if this is a mismatch c is not equal
 

523
00:13:59,279 --> 00:13:59,829
so if this is a mismatch c is not equal
to d

524
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
to d
 

525
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,509
to d
what is

526
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
what is
 

527
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,949
what is
yeah so the one after c should be equals

528
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
yeah so the one after c should be equals
 

529
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:07,590
yeah so the one after c should be equals
to

530
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
to
 

531
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,710
to
to this part right yeah okay so that

532
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
to this part right yeah okay so that
 

533
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,389
to this part right yeah okay so that
should be easy look

534
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:12,399
should be easy look
 

535
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:29,110
should be easy look
this this p is the same right

536
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120

 

537
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,990

look we start with the s yeah okay let's

538
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
look we start with the s yeah okay let's
 

539
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,389
look we start with the s yeah okay let's
try

540
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
try
 

541
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,750
try
yes no no because yellow is bigger than

542
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
yes no no because yellow is bigger than
 

543
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,030
yes no no because yellow is bigger than
s1 so let's start with

544
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
s1 so let's start with
 

545
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,110
s1 so let's start with
s1 okay all right okay right look

546
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
s1 okay all right okay right look
 

547
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:56,230
s1 okay all right okay right look
e s yellow

548
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240

 

549
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,790

we have a mismatch at here that means

550
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
we have a mismatch at here that means
 

551
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,030
we have a mismatch at here that means
all of you always need to be used

552
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
all of you always need to be used
 

553
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,870
all of you always need to be used
okay so then we turn return what s 0 is

554
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
okay so then we turn return what s 0 is
 

555
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,750
okay so then we turn return what s 0 is
more right so

556
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
more right so
 

557
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,790
more right so
s c l i

558
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
s c l i
 

559
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:25,670
s c l i
plus 1 1 column equals

560
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680

 

561
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,110

why is it true because we it's too wide

562
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
why is it true because we it's too wide
 

563
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,030
why is it true because we it's too wide
because if if this is all match what

564
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
because if if this is all match what
 

565
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,470
because if if this is all match what
does it mean

566
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
does it mean
 

567
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,310
does it mean
immediately if this is that means

568
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
immediately if this is that means
 

569
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,829
immediately if this is that means
it means can you give me an example when

570
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:39,839
it means can you give me an example when
 

571
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,150
it means can you give me an example when
we

572
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
we
 

573
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,829
we
reach this point everywhere

574
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
reach this point everywhere
 

575
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,710
reach this point everywhere
can you give me an example one code we

576
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
can you give me an example one code we
 

577
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,870
can you give me an example one code we
will be executed here

578
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
will be executed here
 

579
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,230
will be executed here
okay so let me do the job okay

580
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240

sorry now what i mean is that
when when the when will be here

592
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
when when the when will be here
 

593
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,829
when when the when will be here
the code will be xq here because look at

594
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839
the code will be xq here because look at
 

595
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,470
the code will be xq here because look at
cll

596
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
cll
 

597
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,030
cll
when there is a mismatch all right right

598
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
when there is a mismatch all right right
 

599
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,590
when there is a mismatch all right right
when i

600
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
when i
 

601
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,150
when i
mean mismatch the code will return

602
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
mean mismatch the code will return
 

603
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,269
mean mismatch the code will return
immediately right

604
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
immediately right
 

605
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,949
immediately right
the code will immediately return here

606
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
the code will immediately return here
 

607
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,870
the code will immediately return here
right yeah

608
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
right yeah
 

609
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,350
right yeah
okay so if the code is not here what

610
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
okay so if the code is not here what
 

611
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,870
okay so if the code is not here what
does it mean there is no mismatch

612
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
does it mean there is no mismatch
 

613
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,550
does it mean there is no mismatch
between

614
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
between
 

615
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,430
between
people

616
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440

 

617
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,440

okay you say e-r-i-c-a-e-i-c right

618
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,450
okay you say e-r-i-c-a-e-i-c right
 

619
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,790
okay you say e-r-i-c-a-e-i-c right

[Music]
 

621
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,710
[Music]
no that's not because look you will find

622
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
no that's not because look you will find
 

623
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,150
no that's not because look you will find
a mismatch in the second

624
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
a mismatch in the second
 

625
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,310
a mismatch in the second
character and he will return here p o p

626
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
character and he will return here p o p
 

627
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,189
character and he will return here p o p
l p

628
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199

631
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:08,630
p o p p my god p o y
p p sorry uh

632
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640

 

633
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,630

anything right if we e-i-c and e-i-c-a

634
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
anything right if we e-i-c and e-i-c-a
 

635
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,829
anything right if we e-i-c and e-i-c-a
for example does it make sense

636
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839
for example does it make sense
 

637
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,069
for example does it make sense
yeah why is that can you explain to me

638
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
yeah why is that can you explain to me
 

639
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,669
yeah why is that can you explain to me
why eic and eica

640
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
why eic and eica
 

641
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:29,590
why eic and eica
would be here because

642
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600

 

643
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,710

s1 because this is this is one

644
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
s1 because this is this is one
 

645
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,870
s1 because this is this is one
because this is bigger than that yeah

646
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
because this is bigger than that yeah
 

647
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,909
because this is bigger than that yeah
and

648
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919

 

649
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,990

and this little thing and just have one

650
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000
and this little thing and just have one
 

651
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,070
and this little thing and just have one
last bit well last bit because this is

652
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
last bit well last bit because this is
 

653
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,669
last bit well last bit because this is
checking the smaller lens right

654
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
checking the smaller lens right
 

655
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,230
checking the smaller lens right
so all these are match so you won't go

656
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
so all these are match so you won't go
 

657
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,510
so all these are match so you won't go
here here right

658
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
here here right
 

659
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,430
here here right
you won't go in here this is miss man

660
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
you won't go in here this is miss man
 

661
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,549
you won't go in here this is miss man
this is the shorter one

662
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
this is the shorter one
 

663
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,630
this is the shorter one
so what does it mean only there's only

664
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
so what does it mean only there's only
 

665
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,909
so what does it mean only there's only
one character

666
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919
one character
 

667
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,470
one character
at last then we have a match right all

668
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
at last then we have a match right all
 

669
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,270
at last then we have a match right all
right

670
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
right
 

671
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,110
right
that's what we mean because if you find

672
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,120
that's what we mean because if you find
 

673
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,630
that's what we mean because if you find
a mismatch here you will

674
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
a mismatch here you will
 

675
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,350
a mismatch here you will
immediately return here got it when it's

676
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360
immediately return here got it when it's
 

677
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,150
immediately return here got it when it's
returned

678
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
returned
 

679
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,190
returned
it's returned the function the function

680
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
it's returned the function the function
 

681
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,150
it's returned the function the function
will exit

682
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
will exit
 

683
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,430
will exit
right we yeah

684
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
right we yeah
 

685
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,270
right we yeah
the function we need to return your exit

686
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
the function we need to return your exit
 

687
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,470
the function we need to return your exit
will not come here

688
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
will not come here
 

689
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,830
will not come here
correct yeah okay

690
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
correct yeah okay
 

691
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,190
correct yeah okay
okay so can you tell me um okay so can

692
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
okay so can you tell me um okay so can
 

693
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,510
okay so can you tell me um okay so can
you

694
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
you
 

695
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,150
you
can you tell me which which which part

696
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,160
can you tell me which which which part
 

697
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,549
can you tell me which which which part
is

698
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
is
 

699
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:37,430
is
what's the term complexity of this one

700
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440

 

701
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,630

yeah yeah mostly o and yes the previous

702
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
yeah yeah mostly o and yes the previous
 

703
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,710
yeah yeah mostly o and yes the previous
one the subsequence n squared

704
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
one the subsequence n squared
 

705
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,909
one the subsequence n squared
no no no it's still one come on before

706
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
no no no it's still one come on before
 

707
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,230
no no no it's still one come on before
that

708
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
that
 

709
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,630
that
is good yeah the subsequence remember we

710
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
is good yeah the subsequence remember we
 

711
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,350
is good yeah the subsequence remember we
check the

712
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,360
check the
 

713
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,510
check the
length is one and we check if one is

714
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:51,520
length is one and we check if one is
 

715
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,789
length is one and we check if one is
another one actually it's

716
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
another one actually it's
 

717
00:18:52,799 --> 00:19:34,789
another one actually it's
all m plus n if

718
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799

 

719
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,070

okay please everyone can see that can

720
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
okay please everyone can see that can
 

721
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,190
okay please everyone can see that can
you guys

722
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
you guys
 

723
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,400
you guys
come on come on

s 0 is the longer one so

728
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,160
s 0 is the longer one so
 

729
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,430
s 0 is the longer one so
i i plus one right we want to check it's

730
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
i i plus one right we want to check it's
 

731
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,110
i i plus one right we want to check it's
next calendar i plus one column

732
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,120
next calendar i plus one column
 

733
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,909
next calendar i plus one column
bracket bracket exactly it should be

734
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
bracket bracket exactly it should be
 

735
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,590
bracket bracket exactly it should be
equal to one

736
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
equal to one
 

737
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,029
equal to one
double equal double equal as

i yeah i yeah
yeah column bracket yes okay that's it

744
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
yeah column bracket yes okay that's it
 

745
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,840
