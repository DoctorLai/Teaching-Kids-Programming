right here
 

9
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,150
right here
okay so today we talk about counting the

10
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,160
okay so today we talk about counting the
 

11
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,110
okay so today we talk about counting the
odd numbers

12
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
odd numbers
 

13
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,670
odd numbers
between a range what's all numbers

14
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680

 

15
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,910

on tables so can you give me a few

16
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
on tables so can you give me a few
 

17
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,710
on tables so can you give me a few
sometimes

18
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
sometimes
 

19
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,349
sometimes
well if we pass it in for nine okay 11

20
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
well if we pass it in for nine okay 11
 

21
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,950
well if we pass it in for nine okay 11
13 15 79

22
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
13 15 79
 

23
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,070
13 15 79
and what's the even number one is the

24
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
and what's the even number one is the
 

25
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,470
and what's the even number one is the
one that could go in the two-time

26
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
one that could go in the two-time
 

27
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,750
one that could go in the two-time
table and has a flat top what's flat top

28
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:33,760
table and has a flat top what's flat top
 

29
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,549
table and has a flat top what's flat top
sorry

30
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
sorry
 

31
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,670
sorry
flat top if you're building blocks

32
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
flat top if you're building blocks
 

33
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,950
flat top if you're building blocks
oh okay okay a lumber block yeah

34
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
oh okay okay a lumber block yeah
 

35
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,270
oh okay okay a lumber block yeah
okay so it's two

36
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280

 

37
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,990

okay so if i give you a range like three

38
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
okay so if i give you a range like three
 

39
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,709
okay so if i give you a range like three
to five

40
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
to five
 

41
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,830
to five
three to seven and remember here

42
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
three to seven and remember here
 

43
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,750
three to seven and remember here
square bracket means inclusive yeah

44
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
square bracket means inclusive yeah
 

45
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,790
square bracket means inclusive yeah
the answer is so how many numbers

46
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
the answer is so how many numbers
 

47
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,510
the answer is so how many numbers
between these

48
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
between these
 

49
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,990
between these
three seven yeah three five seven yeah

50
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
three seven yeah three five seven yeah
 

51
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,189
three seven yeah three five seven yeah
three five seven

52
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
three five seven
 

53
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,670
three five seven
because the seven is inclusive how about

54
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
because the seven is inclusive how about
 

55
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,030
because the seven is inclusive how about
this

56
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
this
 

57
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,109
this
how many numbers are all number between

58
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
how many numbers are all number between
 

59
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,550
how many numbers are all number between
this range five

60
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
this range five
 

61
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,230
this range five
yeah just fine yeah you got it yeah this

62
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
yeah just fine yeah you got it yeah this
 

63
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,590
yeah just fine yeah you got it yeah this
is called uh this is

64
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
is called uh this is
 

65
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,870
is called uh this is
parentheses on exclusive okay so

66
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
parentheses on exclusive okay so
 

67
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,350
parentheses on exclusive okay so
yeah you understand this three seven and

68
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
yeah you understand this three seven and
 

69
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,230
yeah you understand this three seven and
how about you've got

70
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
how about you've got
 

71
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,830
how about you've got
if i tell you like it's three like a

72
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
if i tell you like it's three like a
 

73
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,630
if i tell you like it's three like a
thousand

74
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
thousand
 

75
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,510
thousand
how many can you count no yeah it's too

76
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
how many can you count no yeah it's too
 

77
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,710
how many can you count no yeah it's too
hard to count yeah

78
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
hard to count yeah
 

79
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,390
hard to count yeah
yeah but how about three seven and two

80
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
yeah but how about three seven and two
 

81
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,190
yeah but how about three seven and two
a thousand you see the answer is the

82
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
a thousand you see the answer is the
 

83
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,230
a thousand you see the answer is the
same right

84
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
same right
 

85
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,870
same right
is it the same you see the same yes or

86
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
is it the same you see the same yes or
 

87
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,590
is it the same you see the same yes or
no

88
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
no
 

89
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,190
no
yeah why is that two is not an

90
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
yeah why is that two is not an
 

91
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,670
yeah why is that two is not an
odd number yeah and it's the next odd

92
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
odd number yeah and it's the next odd
 

93
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,350
odd number yeah and it's the next odd
number is three yeah

94
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
number is three yeah
 

95
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,149
number is three yeah
so these two answer the same so if this

96
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
so these two answer the same so if this
 

97
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,310
so these two answer the same so if this
lower case

98
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
lower case
 

99
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,910
lower case
if this lower bound is even number

100
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
if this lower bound is even number
 

101
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,910
if this lower bound is even number
so it's the same as this right

102
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
so it's the same as this right
 

103
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,469
so it's the same as this right
yeah it's the same as this if if this is

104
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
yeah it's the same as this if if this is
 

105
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:04,950
yeah it's the same as this if if this is
the

106
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
the
 

107
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,389
the
if error is even number the answer will

108
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
if error is even number the answer will
 

109
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,190
if error is even number the answer will
be the same as

110
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
be the same as
 

111
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,869
be the same as
l plus one r right so we we can actually

112
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
l plus one r right so we we can actually
 

113
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,990
l plus one r right so we we can actually
ask computer to

114
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
ask computer to
 

115
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,790
ask computer to
count the numbers between this range

116
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
count the numbers between this range
 

117
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,550
count the numbers between this range
okay let's quickly divide that again

118
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
okay let's quickly divide that again
 

119
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,830
okay let's quickly divide that again
okay

120
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840

 

121
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,830

define curve

122
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
define curve
 

123
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,830
define curve
odd lr

124
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
odd lr
 

125
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,270
odd lr
column okay let's say answer equal

126
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
column okay let's say answer equal
 

127
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,150
column okay let's say answer equal
zero and then now if air

128
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
zero and then now if air
 

129
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,710
zero and then now if air
it's even number right how do we say how

130
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
it's even number right how do we say how
 

131
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,830
it's even number right how do we say how
do we check if it's an even number

132
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
do we check if it's an even number
 

133
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,270
do we check if it's an even number
we you know divided by two if

134
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
we you know divided by two if
 

135
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,710
we you know divided by two if
it's zero right if divided by two

136
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
it's zero right if divided by two
 

137
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,790
it's zero right if divided by two
is 0 look like if it divided by 2 equals

138
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
is 0 look like if it divided by 2 equals
 

139
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,070
is 0 look like if it divided by 2 equals
0 it's an even number

140
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
0 it's an even number
 

141
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,670
0 it's an even number
and in this case we can do one

142
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
and in this case we can do one
 

143
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,350
and in this case we can do one
l plus equal one we can make it

144
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
l plus equal one we can make it
 

145
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,509
l plus equal one we can make it
up one yeah the weather okay then

146
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
up one yeah the weather okay then
 

147
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,270
up one yeah the weather okay then
look and wire air smaller or equal

148
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
look and wire air smaller or equal
 

149
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,309
look and wire air smaller or equal
r and then i can count it

150
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
r and then i can count it
 

151
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,589
r and then i can count it
yeah count the all number yeah and what

152
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
yeah count the all number yeah and what
 

153
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,550
yeah count the all number yeah and what
happened to air

154
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
happened to air
 

155
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,070
happened to air
l plus equal

156
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080

 

157
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,270

one like two two yeah two because three

158
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
one like two two yeah two because three
 

159
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,270

are bigger than r right yeah okay return
 

165
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,910
are bigger than r right yeah okay return
turn off what's the time complexity for

166
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
turn off what's the time complexity for
 

167
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,270
turn off what's the time complexity for
this one i win

168
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
this one i win
 

169
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,200
this one i win
what's n what's n

170
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,210
what's n what's n
 

171
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,670
what's n what's n
[Music]

172
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
[Music]
 

173
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,509
[Music]
what's the n what's the what's uh what

174
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
what's the n what's the what's uh what
 

175
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,149
what's the n what's the what's uh what
are we looking for here

176
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
are we looking for here
 

177
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,390
are we looking for here
what's n number yeah the odd numbers

178
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
what's n number yeah the odd numbers
 

179
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,429
what's n number yeah the odd numbers
between this range

180
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
between this range
 

181
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,350
between this range
yeah also n is roughly r minus l divided

182
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
yeah also n is roughly r minus l divided
 

183
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,429
yeah also n is roughly r minus l divided
by 2.

184
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
by 2.
 

185
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,509
by 2.
but yeah but we dropped a constant yeah

186
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
but yeah but we dropped a constant yeah
 

187
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,110
but yeah but we dropped a constant yeah
so you can say oh n which

188
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
so you can say oh n which
 

189
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,030
so you can say oh n which
n is the number of numbers between this

190
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
n is the number of numbers between this
 

191
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,470
n is the number of numbers between this
range okay wear them

192
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
range okay wear them
 

193
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,070
range okay wear them
but apparently if r is a minion

194
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
but apparently if r is a minion
 

195
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,030
but apparently if r is a minion
right then it's going to take forever

196
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
right then it's going to take forever
 

197
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,149
right then it's going to take forever
yeah i'm right all right

198
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
yeah i'm right all right
 

199
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,229
yeah i'm right all right
it's going to take forever yeah you're

200
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
it's going to take forever yeah you're
 

201
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,229
it's going to take forever yeah you're
nothing yeah nothing

202
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
nothing yeah nothing
 

203
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,270
nothing yeah nothing
going to take forever is that possible

204
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
going to take forever is that possible
 

205
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,030
going to take forever is that possible
we can just do a mathematic calculation

206
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
we can just do a mathematic calculation
 

207
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,510
we can just do a mathematic calculation
yeah we can of course of course we can

208
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
yeah we can of course of course we can
 

209
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,469
yeah we can of course of course we can
okay so

210
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
okay so
 

211
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,870
okay so
remember we have a range function we

212
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
remember we have a range function we
 

213
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,230
remember we have a range function we
have a range function and we can

214
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
have a range function and we can
 

215
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,230
have a range function and we can
actually cheat a little bit ask computer

216
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
actually cheat a little bit ask computer
 

217
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,030
actually cheat a little bit ask computer
to do that

218
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
to do that
 

219
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,550
to do that
math for us range so we can say

220
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
math for us range so we can say
 

221
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,030
math for us range so we can say
uh define count and let's define count

222
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
uh define count and let's define count
 

223
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,790
uh define count and let's define count
odd

224
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
odd
 

225
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,110
odd
lr okay so look it's the same

226
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
lr okay so look it's the same
 

227
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,469
lr okay so look it's the same
if air

228
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
if air
 

229
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,310
if air
modulus 2 equal equal

230
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
modulus 2 equal equal
 

231
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,070
modulus 2 equal equal
1 if it's if it's odd number then we can

232
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
1 if it's if it's odd number then we can
 

233
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,110
1 if it's if it's odd number then we can
directly return

234
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
directly return
 

235
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,230
directly return
length depends on what range

236
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
length depends on what range
 

237
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,629
length depends on what range
right we generally iterate the range

238
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
right we generally iterate the range
 

239
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,629
right we generally iterate the range
will be air

240
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
will be air
 

241
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,670
will be air
and what's the second parameter but

242
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
and what's the second parameter but
 

243
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,110
and what's the second parameter but
actually you'll be r plus one yeah

244
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
actually you'll be r plus one yeah
 

245
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,150
actually you'll be r plus one yeah
because the

246
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
because the
 

247
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,550
because the
the destination is exclusive in the

248
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
the destination is exclusive in the
 

249
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,909
the destination is exclusive in the
range function

250
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
range function
 

251
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,390
range function
for example in the range function range

252
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
for example in the range function range
 

253
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,029
for example in the range function range
one to

254
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
one to
 

255
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,870
one to
ten will be

256
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880

 

257
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,270

yeah so we need to ah plus one here and

258
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
yeah so we need to ah plus one here and
 

259
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,629
yeah so we need to ah plus one here and
what's the third parameter

260
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639

 

261
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,029

what's the sub parameter we ask you to

262
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
what's the sub parameter we ask you to
 

263
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,909
what's the sub parameter we ask you to
step every

264
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
step every
 

265
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,430
step every
every time we want to step how many

266
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
every time we want to step how many
 

267
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,950
every time we want to step how many
times two

268
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
times two
 

269
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,310
times two
two times so we put a two here let's say

270
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
two times so we put a two here let's say
 

271
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,310
two times so we put a two here let's say
we ask the computer to do it this range

272
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
we ask the computer to do it this range
 

273
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,990
we ask the computer to do it this range
function you will give an iterator and

274
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
function you will give an iterator and
 

275
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,230
function you will give an iterator and
the computer will do the math for you

276
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
the computer will do the math for you
 

277
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,510
the computer will do the math for you
and here there will be even number right

278
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
and here there will be even number right
 

279
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,189
and here there will be even number right
so if it's even number what should we do

280
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
so if it's even number what should we do
 

281
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,070
so if it's even number what should we do
what should we do range what should we

282
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
what should we do range what should we
 

283
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,710
what should we do range what should we
do here

284
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
do here
 

285
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,790
do here
if it's an even number what should i put

286
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
if it's an even number what should i put
 

287
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,749
if it's an even number what should i put
here

288
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
here
 

289
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,950
here
plus one l plus one last one

290
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
plus one l plus one last one
 

291
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,469
plus one l plus one last one
r plus one and three where down that's

292
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:08,479
r plus one and three where down that's
 

293
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,029
r plus one and three where down that's
it

294
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
it
 

295
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,710
it
yeah the computer will just do the math

296
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
yeah the computer will just do the math
 

297
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,230
yeah the computer will just do the math
for you yeah you see yeah as i said

298
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
for you yeah you see yeah as i said
 

299
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,710
for you yeah you see yeah as i said
if it's even number it's the answer is

300
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
if it's even number it's the answer is
 

301
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,790
if it's even number it's the answer is
the same as l plus one yeah because

302
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
the same as l plus one yeah because
 

303
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,469
the same as l plus one yeah because
if it's even number it's not all number

304
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
if it's even number it's not all number
 

305
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,150
if it's even number it's not all number
okay

306
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
okay
 

307
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,189
okay
we we can actually do this math if you

308
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
we we can actually do this math if you
 

309
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,749
we we can actually do this math if you
want to

310
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
want to
 

311
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,990
want to
compute this grand uh function we can

312
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
compute this grand uh function we can
 

313
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,870
compute this grand uh function we can
just do this

314
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
just do this
 

315
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,029
just do this
we can define our f function and define

316
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
we can define our f function and define
 

317
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,230
we can define our f function and define
f function

318
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
f function
 

319
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,990
f function
l r and what's the if air

320
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
l r and what's the if air
 

321
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,270
l r and what's the if air
if air is like odd number let's say

322
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
if air is like odd number let's say
 

323
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,390
if air is like odd number let's say
and how many let's say how many

324
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
and how many let's say how many
 

325
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,510
and how many let's say how many
odd numbers between this range right

326
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
odd numbers between this range right
 

327
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,550
odd numbers between this range right
if l is 5 3 two seven

328
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
if l is 5 3 two seven
 

329
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,189
if l is 5 3 two seven
we turn three to seven how many all

330
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
we turn three to seven how many all
 

331
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,110
we turn three to seven how many all
numbers between these

332
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120

 

333
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,110

how many numbers between uh three to

334
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
how many numbers between uh three to
 

335
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,150
how many numbers between uh three to
five two three

336
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
five two three
 

337
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,070
five two three
seven three four

338
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
seven three four
 

339
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,870
seven three four
five six seven how many odd numbers

340
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
five six seven how many odd numbers
 

341
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,830
five six seven how many odd numbers
between

342
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
between
 

343
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,469
between
three yeah so we can do this we can do

344
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
three yeah so we can do this we can do
 

345
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,309
three yeah so we can do this we can do
what

346
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
what
 

347
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,830
what
we can seven minus three

348
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
we can seven minus three
 

349
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,830
we can seven minus three
divided by two is three five these two

350
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
divided by two is three five these two
 

351
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,110
divided by two is three five these two
but we need to plus

352
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
but we need to plus
 

353
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,230
but we need to plus
a as a one at the end

354
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
a as a one at the end
 

355
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,670
a as a one at the end
yeah okay so that would be

356
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
yeah okay so that would be
 

357
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,150
yeah okay so that would be
three yeah okay and how about eight if i

358
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
three yeah okay and how about eight if i
 

359
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,350
three yeah okay and how about eight if i
put a it's the same a minus three

360
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
put a it's the same a minus three
 

361
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,670
put a it's the same a minus three
divided by two two point five but we use

362
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
divided by two two point five but we use
 

363
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,589
divided by two two point five but we use
the two plus one three yeah

364
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
the two plus one three yeah
 

365
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,550
the two plus one three yeah
okay so you the answer would be return

366
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
okay so you the answer would be return
 

367
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,749
okay so you the answer would be return
r minus l

368
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759

 

369
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,270

divided by two and one

370
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
divided by two and one
 

371
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,390
divided by two and one
plus one plus one okay and then here

372
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
plus one plus one okay and then here
 

373
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,909
plus one plus one okay and then here
we don't we can just do this

374
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
we don't we can just do this
 

375
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,950
we don't we can just do this
we can just return f

376
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
we can just return f
 

377
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,309
we can just return f
l r right yeah

378
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
l r right yeah
 

379
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,589
l r right yeah
and then here i can say return f a

380
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
and then here i can say return f a
 

381
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,869
and then here i can say return f a
plus one all right yeah this

382
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
plus one all right yeah this
 

383
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,430
plus one all right yeah this
works because they we assume that error

384
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
works because they we assume that error
 

385
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,869
works because they we assume that error
is odd number okay

386
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879

 

387
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,070

can we can we actually count and now

388
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
can we can we actually count and now
 

389
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,629
can we can we actually count and now
another way to do it better

390
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
another way to do it better
 

391
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,790
another way to do it better
yeah actually we are counting actually

392
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
yeah actually we are counting actually
 

393
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,749
yeah actually we are counting actually
this is counting

394
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
this is counting
 

395
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,309
this is counting
but another way of doing this is what

396
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
but another way of doing this is what
 

397
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:26,790
but another way of doing this is what
because

398
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
because
 

399
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,070
because
air and i look okay

400
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
air and i look okay
 

401
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,190
air and i look okay
here here is air this is zero yeah

402
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
here here is air this is zero yeah
 

403
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,709
here here is air this is zero yeah
i is here the number of all numbers

404
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
i is here the number of all numbers
 

405
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,790
i is here the number of all numbers
the num the odd numbers between this

406
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
the num the odd numbers between this
 

407
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,750
the num the odd numbers between this
range

408
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
range
 

409
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,870
range
is it is it equals to the number of all

410
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
is it is it equals to the number of all
 

411
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,430
is it is it equals to the number of all
numbers

412
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
numbers
 

413
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,630
numbers
at this range zero to r

414
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
at this range zero to r
 

415
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,949
at this range zero to r
minus zero to l minus one right

416
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
minus zero to l minus one right
 

417
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,509
minus zero to l minus one right
yeah got it

418
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
yeah got it
 

419
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,790
yeah got it
i want to click this bit but

420
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
i want to click this bit but
 

421
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,509
i want to click this bit but
if i can count this bit and count this

422
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
if i can count this bit and count this
 

423
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,470
if i can count this bit and count this
bit

424
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
bit
 

425
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,070
bit
the difference would be the answer right

426
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
the difference would be the answer right
 

427
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,870
the difference would be the answer right
does it make sense yeah makes sense okay

428
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
does it make sense yeah makes sense okay
 

429
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,509
does it make sense yeah makes sense okay
so

430
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
so
 

431
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,670
so
so if we count the counterfeit how can

432
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
so if we count the counterfeit how can
 

433
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,990
so if we count the counterfeit how can
we count a bit

434
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
we count a bit
 

435
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,990
we count a bit
from zero to the lower minus one yeah

436
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
from zero to the lower minus one yeah
 

437
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,630
from zero to the lower minus one yeah
because

438
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
because
 

439
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,630
because
we want to increase the lower but no

440
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
we want to increase the lower but no
 

441
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,269
we want to increase the lower but no
minus one how many how many

442
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
minus one how many how many
 

443
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,470
minus one how many how many
how many all numbers in this range

444
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480

 

445
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,750

l minus one

446
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760

 

447
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,230

one minus zero and how many numbers plus

448
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
one minus zero and how many numbers plus
 

449
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,350
one minus zero and how many numbers plus
one

450
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
one
 

451
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,550
one
divided by two that's the lamp let's

452
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
divided by two that's the lamp let's
 

453

503
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,350
r alpha one yeah yeah that's right
seven okay it's seven plus one nothing

504
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
seven okay it's seven plus one nothing
 

505
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,190
seven okay it's seven plus one nothing
seven plus one divided by two

506
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
seven plus one divided by two
 

507
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,550
seven plus one divided by two
is four four minus one okay this is one

508
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
is four four minus one okay this is one
 

509
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,310
is four four minus one okay this is one
three okay let's give another example

510
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
three okay let's give another example
 

511
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,069
three okay let's give another example
like two two

512
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
like two two
 

513
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,150
like two two
two two twenty okay how many are numbers

514
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
two two twenty okay how many are numbers
 

515
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,590
two two twenty okay how many are numbers
let's say three five

516
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
let's say three five
 

517
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,790
let's say three five
seven nine eleven thirteen

518
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
seven nine eleven thirteen
 

519
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,389
seven nine eleven thirteen
fifteen seventeen nineteen the 9 right

520
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
fifteen seventeen nineteen the 9 right
 

521
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,829
fifteen seventeen nineteen the 9 right
yeah let's put this 20 plus 1

522
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
yeah let's put this 20 plus 1
 

523
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,990
yeah let's put this 20 plus 1
divided by 2 minus 2 divided by 2

524
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
divided by 2 minus 2 divided by 2
 

525
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,870
divided by 2 minus 2 divided by 2
so that's 21 divided by 2 is 10 in 10

526
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
so that's 21 divided by 2 is 10 in 10
 

527
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,269
so that's 21 divided by 2 is 10 in 10
point

528
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
point
 

529
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,470
point
but we we just discard the fraction yeah

530
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
but we we just discard the fraction yeah
 

531
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,990
but we we just discard the fraction yeah
minus one it's not uh isn't that

532
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000

 

533
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,590

10 minus 40 but why is

534
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
10 minus 40 but why is
 

535
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,829
10 minus 40 but why is
nine oh yeah it's nine yeah one two

536
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
nine oh yeah it's nine yeah one two
 

537
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,990
nine oh yeah it's nine yeah one two
three four five

538
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000

 

539
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,629

so what's the time complexity for this

540
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
so what's the time complexity for this
 

541
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,160
so what's the time complexity for this
one

542
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,170
one
 

543
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,629
one

[Music]
 

545
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,230
[Music]
eric can you get it what's the time

546
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
eric can you get it what's the time
 

547
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,550
eric can you get it what's the time
complexity for this approach

548
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
complexity for this approach
 

549
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,069
complexity for this approach
oh what

550
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
oh what
 

551
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,310
oh what
i want oh one well because we are not

552
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
i want oh one well because we are not
 

553
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,310
i want oh one well because we are not
using we are not iterating yeah

554
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
using we are not iterating yeah
 

555
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,430
using we are not iterating yeah
what's the space complexity

556
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
what's the space complexity
 

557
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,670
what's the space complexity
uh do we need to use space

558
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680

 

559
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,509

do we need to actually use space

560
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
do we need to actually use space
 

561
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,670
do we need to actually use space
now if we're not using space what's the

562
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
now if we're not using space what's the
 

563
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,110
now if we're not using space what's the
time complex what's the space from

564
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
time complex what's the space from
 

565
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,790
time complex what's the space from

566
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
brexit
 

567
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,949

oh come on give me a number

568
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959

 

569
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,750

one yeah one here that's it yeah give me

one yeah one here that's it yeah give me
 

571
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,629
one yeah one here that's it yeah give me
a number

572
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
a number
 

573
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,230
a number
yeah i just give you a thing now it's

574
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
yeah i just give you a thing now it's
 

575
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,910
yeah i just give you a thing now it's
like give me a number what number n is

576
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
like give me a number what number n is
 

577
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,190
like give me a number what number n is
no number okay

578
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
no number okay
 

579
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,030
no number okay
if we're not using any space it's all

580
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
if we're not using any space it's all
 

581
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,710
if we're not using any space it's all
one if it's not

582
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
one if it's not
 

583
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,190
one if it's not
third one okay because we are just

584
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
third one okay because we are just
 

585
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,790
third one okay because we are just
calculating yeah so we're just

586
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
calculating yeah so we're just
 

587
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,389
calculating yeah so we're just
calculating it it's

588
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
calculating it it's
 

589
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,350
calculating it it's
mathematic it's just all one yeah so we

590
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
mathematic it's just all one yeah so we
 

591
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,389
mathematic it's just all one yeah so we
can just

592
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
can just
 

593
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,310
can just
just do the calculation so yeah that

594
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
just do the calculation so yeah that
 

595
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,829
just do the calculation so yeah that
will be it for today

596
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
will be it for today
 

597
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,880
will be it for today
thank you very much bye
