25
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,270
numbers non-negative what's next
non-negative what's negative oh means

26
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
non-negative what's negative oh means
 

27
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,590
non-negative what's negative oh means
uh you know like below zero

28
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
uh you know like below zero
 

29
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,990
uh you know like below zero
not below zero so it's bigger or equal

30
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
not below zero so it's bigger or equal
 

31
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,310
not below zero so it's bigger or equal
to zero okay yeah

32
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
to zero okay yeah
 

33
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,029
to zero okay yeah
okay so they i if i tell you that there

34
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
okay so they i if i tell you that there
 

35
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,750
okay so they i if i tell you that there
are k

36
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
are k
 

37
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,029
are k
numbers in here right the k

38
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
numbers in here right the k
 

39
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,389
numbers in here right the k
numbers which are greater or equal

40
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
numbers which are greater or equal
 

41
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,270
numbers which are greater or equal
than k okay so k numbers here which are

42
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
than k okay so k numbers here which are
 

43
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,149
than k okay so k numbers here which are
greater or equal than k

44
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
greater or equal than k
 

45
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,670
greater or equal than k
yes sorry what's four there are 4k

46
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
yes sorry what's four there are 4k
 

47
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,670
yes sorry what's four there are 4k
no no no no there are four numbers but

48
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
no no no no there are four numbers but
 

49
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,710
no no no no there are four numbers but
i'm telling you k

50
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720
i'm telling you k
 

51
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,230
i'm telling you k
is a num a number there are k numbers

52
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
is a num a number there are k numbers
 

53
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,270
is a num a number there are k numbers
here uh which are bigger than k

54
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
here uh which are bigger than k
 

55
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,830
here uh which are bigger than k
so find out k so you need to tell me

56
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
so find out k so you need to tell me
 

57
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,469
so find out k so you need to tell me
what is

58
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
what is
 

59
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,749
what is
k find out k and if k

60
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
k find out k and if k
 

61
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,230
k find out k and if k
doesn't exist then you need to tell me k

62
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
doesn't exist then you need to tell me k
 

63
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,310
doesn't exist then you need to tell me k
equals minus one okay

64
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
equals minus one okay
 

65
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,950
equals minus one okay
so for example how many k will be here

66
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
so for example how many k will be here
 

67
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,510
so for example how many k will be here
yellow

68
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
yellow
 

69
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,870
yellow
three one two three right

70
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
three one two three right
 

71
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,910
three one two three right
three four much or bigger or equal

72
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
three four much or bigger or equal
 

73
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,550
three four much or bigger or equal
yeah look what's what's possibility of k

74
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
yeah look what's what's possibility of k
 

75
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,950
yeah look what's what's possibility of k
uh okay

76
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960

 

77
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,310

yeah it could be zero one

78
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
yeah it could be zero one
 

79
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,429
yeah it could be zero one
two three four yeah yeah

80
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
two three four yeah yeah
 

81
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,109
two three four yeah yeah
okay so zero is zero numbers here bigger

82
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
okay so zero is zero numbers here bigger
 

83
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,389
okay so zero is zero numbers here bigger
or equal to zero

84
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
or equal to zero
 

85
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,830
or equal to zero
yes or no why is that because that's

86
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
yes or no why is that because that's
 

87
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,749
yes or no why is that because that's
zero no no no one k

88
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
zero no no no one k
 

89
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,790
zero no no no one k
is zero what does it mean can you find

90
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
is zero what does it mean can you find
 

91
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,229
is zero what does it mean can you find
any number here which

92
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
any number here which
 

93
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,670
any number here which
are bigger or equal than zero there are

94
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
are bigger or equal than zero there are
 

95
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,350
are bigger or equal than zero there are
four yes the output is four okay

96
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
four yes the output is four okay
 

97
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,070
four yes the output is four okay
say one right and four another thing not

98
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
say one right and four another thing not
 

99
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,790
say one right and four another thing not
the same yes

100
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
the same yes
 

101
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,150
the same yes
and one how about k equal one one number

102
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
and one how about k equal one one number
 

103
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,229
and one how about k equal one one number
is bigger than one no because they look

104
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
is bigger than one no because they look
 

105
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,350
is bigger than one no because they look
yeah there's no one okay no no no look

106
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
yeah there's no one okay no no no look
 

107
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,589
yeah there's no one okay no no no look
three five nine are bigger than one

108
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
three five nine are bigger than one
 

109
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,630
three five nine are bigger than one
right

110
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
right
 

111
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,949
right
so you see it's not the same

we
 

143
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,910
we
proof was all okay and we check we count

144
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
proof was all okay and we check we count
 

145
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,070
proof was all okay and we check we count
how many numbers here are bigger than k

146
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
how many numbers here are bigger than k
 

147
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,670
how many numbers here are bigger than k
right yeah

148
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
right yeah
 

149
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,350
right yeah
okay three three

150
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
okay three three
 

151
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,470
okay three three
okay can i write it yeah can i write it

152
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
okay can i write it yeah can i write it
 

153
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,509
okay can i write it yeah can i write it
maybe you can look at

154
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
maybe you can look at
 

155
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,229
maybe you can look at
maybe you so first of all we need to we

156
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
maybe you so first of all we need to we
 

157
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,910
maybe you so first of all we need to we
need to come up with a function

158
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
need to come up with a function
 

159
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,470
need to come up with a function
to count how many numbers that are

160
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
to count how many numbers that are
 

161
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,070
to count how many numbers that are
bigger or equal than k

162
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
bigger or equal than k
 

163
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,030
bigger or equal than k
right how can we do this if the numbers

164
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
right how can we do this if the numbers
 

165
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,309
right how can we do this if the numbers
let's make it count count

166
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319

 

167
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,670

can i have one can i have one of these

178
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
can i have one can i have one of these
 

179
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,830
can i have one can i have one of these
three um

180
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840

 

181
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,390

how can we implement this function this

182
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
how can we implement this function this
 

183
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,069
how can we implement this function this
is supposed to be very easy right

184
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
is supposed to be very easy right
 

185
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,110
is supposed to be very easy right
all right yeah count bigger or equal

186
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
all right yeah count bigger or equal
 

187
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,310
all right yeah count bigger or equal
than k

188
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
than k
 

189
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,749
than k
how can we keep counting okay okay so we

190
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
how can we keep counting okay okay so we
 

191
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,390
how can we keep counting okay okay so we
start from

192
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
start from
 

193
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,230
start from
zero no no no i'm saying no now it's the

194
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
zero no no no i'm saying no now it's the
 

195
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,550
zero no no no i'm saying no now it's the
simple version which is i already tell

196
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
simple version which is i already tell
 

197
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,390
simple version which is i already tell
you i want to count the numbers

198
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
you i want to count the numbers
 

199
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,590
you i want to count the numbers
in the numbers in this array how many

200
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
in the numbers in this array how many
 

201
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,230
in the numbers in this array how many
numbers

202
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
numbers
 

203
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,790
numbers
are bigger or equal than k can we just

204
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
are bigger or equal than k can we just
 

205
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,670
are bigger or equal than k can we just
do it with a for loop

206
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
do it with a for loop
 

207
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,110
do it with a for loop
okay does it make sense all right

208
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
okay does it make sense all right
 

209
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,230
okay does it make sense all right
can you write the for loop all right

210
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
can you write the for loop all right
 

211
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,430
can you write the for loop all right
look

212
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
look
 

213
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,550
look
answer equals zero okay

214
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
answer equals zero okay
 

215
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,189
answer equals zero okay
and then certainly here you you need to

216
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
and then certainly here you you need to
 

217
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:55,670
and then certainly here you you need to
return

218
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
return
 

219
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,350
return
answer right yeah all right yeah

220
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
answer right yeah all right yeah
 

221
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,909
answer right yeah all right yeah
so i want to go through the numbers in

222
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
so i want to go through the numbers in
 

223
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,390
so i want to go through the numbers in
numbs

224
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
numbs
 

225
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,990
numbs
how can i do it all right

226
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
how can i do it all right
 

227
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,230
how can i do it all right
everybody do you know how can i get

228
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
everybody do you know how can i get
 

229
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,510
everybody do you know how can i get
close to the number

230
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520

use this function this function will be
 

299
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,749
use this function this function will be
used a lot right because

300
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
used a lot right because
 

301
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,589
used a lot right because
if we do the proof of thing we just do

302

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,430
minus one what's the time complexity
here

338
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
here
 

339
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,670
here
what's the time frame

340
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680

 

341
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,629

here is what here is one oh n yeah

342
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
here is what here is one oh n yeah
 

343
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,869
here is what here is one oh n yeah
here's our one

344
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
here's our one
 

345
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,230
here's our one
and here is what oh n so what's that

346
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
and here is what oh n so what's that
 

347
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,110
and here is what oh n so what's that
what's that somewhere that's more worse

348
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
what's that somewhere that's more worse
 

349
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,029
what's that somewhere that's more worse
oh it's good so it's very bad right

350
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
oh it's good so it's very bad right
 

351
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,509
oh it's good so it's very bad right
yeah so look you shouldn't tell us that

352
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
yeah so look you shouldn't tell us that
 

353
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,110
yeah so look you shouldn't tell us that
one

354
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
one
 

355
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,269
one
as a comparison look at me do you

356
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
as a comparison look at me do you
 

357
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,870
as a comparison look at me do you
understand yeah

358
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
understand yeah
 

359
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,550
understand yeah
yeah blue four thing yeah that's what i

360
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
yeah blue four thing yeah that's what i
 

361
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,310
yeah blue four thing yeah that's what i
did at the beginning right

362
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
did at the beginning right
 

363
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,590
did at the beginning right
yeah yeah so if

364
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
yeah yeah so if
 

365
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,750
yeah yeah so if
if we can improve this function then we

366
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
if we can improve this function then we
 

367
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,990
if we can improve this function then we
can input the overall complexity right

368
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
can input the overall complexity right
 

369
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,910
can input the overall complexity right
so there are two ways to speed up right

370
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:53,920
so there are two ways to speed up right
 

371
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,750
so there are two ways to speed up right
all right either

372
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
all right either
 

373
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,030
all right either
we improve these this function

374
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
we improve these this function
 

375
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,470
we improve these this function
or we improve this right right

376
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
or we improve this right right
 

377
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,790
or we improve this right right
because this algorithm consists of two

378
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
because this algorithm consists of two
 

379
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,870
because this algorithm consists of two
parts you want to iterate

380
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
parts you want to iterate
 

381
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,070
parts you want to iterate
over k elements k k possibilities

382
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
over k elements k k possibilities
 

383
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,350
over k elements k k possibilities
uh the n yeah k from zero to numbers the

384
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
uh the n yeah k from zero to numbers the
 

385
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,310
uh the n yeah k from zero to numbers the
numbers yeah

386
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
numbers yeah
 

387
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,670
numbers yeah
and then for each one you want to try

388
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
and then for each one you want to try
 

389
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,430
and then for each one you want to try
but this function it takes away right

390
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
but this function it takes away right
 

391
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,550
but this function it takes away right
yes doesn't make sense

392
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
yes doesn't make sense
 

393
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,590
yes doesn't make sense
got it okay dmss okay

394
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
got it okay dmss okay
 

395
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,630
got it okay dmss okay
what's okay okay

396
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
what's okay okay
 

397
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,829
what's okay okay
okay if you say okay i'm going to ask

398
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839

 

399
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,870

you

400
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
you
 

401
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,470
you
okay can you explain to me what's the

402
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
okay can you explain to me what's the
 

403
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,070
okay can you explain to me what's the
best part i i

404
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
best part i i
 

405
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,150
best part i i
need david handle yeah he got the pen

406
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
need david handle yeah he got the pen
 

407
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,010
need david handle yeah he got the pen
what's this okay

408
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,020
what's this okay
 

409
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,509
what's this okay
[Music]

410

that how many are bigger yeah

412
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
that how many are bigger yeah
 

413
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,269
that how many are bigger yeah
and then this is

414
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
and then this is
 

415
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,949
and then this is
yeah yeah the number

416
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
yeah yeah the number
 

417
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,230
yeah yeah the number
that is compared to

418
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
that is compared to
 

419
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,269
that is compared to
i didn't have this that that if it's the

420
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
i didn't have this that that if it's the
 

421
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,750
i didn't have this that that if it's the
same yeah if they are k numbers that

422
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
same yeah if they are k numbers that
 

423
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,630
same yeah if they are k numbers that
uh if they are k numbers which are

424
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
uh if they are k numbers which are
 

425
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,590
uh if they are k numbers which are
bigger than k

426
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
bigger than k
 

427
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,310
bigger than k
then we return k if we confirm any k how

428
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
then we return k if we confirm any k how
 

429
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,509
then we return k if we confirm any k how
many k possibilities

430
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
many k possibilities
 

431
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,750
many k possibilities
will be n plus one possibility from zero

432
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
will be n plus one possibility from zero
 

433
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,949
will be n plus one possibility from zero
to n right

434
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
to n right
 

435
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,310
to n right
and otherwise return minus one correct

436
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
and otherwise return minus one correct
 

437
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,150
and otherwise return minus one correct
now okay so

438
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
now okay so
 

439
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,870
now okay so
we can improve two two bits first of all

440
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
we can improve two two bits first of all
 

441
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,949
we can improve two two bits first of all
we can improve this function or we can

442
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
we can improve this function or we can
 

443
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,710
we can improve this function or we can
improve how we search this k

444
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
improve how we search this k
 

445
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,550
improve how we search this k
value i'm right okay so first of all

446
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
value i'm right okay so first of all
 

447
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,310
value i'm right okay so first of all
let's improve this f function okay how

448
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
let's improve this f function okay how
 

449

so if i want you to this is the list of
 

473
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,150
so if i want you to this is the list of
numbers if i want you to tell me

474

numbers if i want you to tell me
 

475
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,790
numbers if i want you to tell me
how many numbers are bigger or equal

476
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
how many numbers are bigger or equal
 

477
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,069
how many numbers are bigger or equal
than two

478
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
than two
 

479
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,110
than two
so how do you do it

480
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
so how do you do it
 

481
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,670
so how do you do it
yeah but imagine this is a very big

482
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
yeah but imagine this is a very big
 

483
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,190
yeah but imagine this is a very big
number you have to check from the

484
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
number you have to check from the
 

485
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,870
number you have to check from the
beginning to the end right

486
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
beginning to the end right
 

487
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,150
beginning to the end right
yeah all right this is all n right can

488
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
yeah all right this is all n right can
 

489
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,470
yeah all right this is all n right can
we do better

we do better
 

491
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,829
we do better
oh can we make it better we're done

492
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
oh can we make it better we're done
 

493
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,509
oh can we make it better we're done
yeah i got it baby yeah okay look wait

00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
yeah i got it baby yeah okay look wait
 

495
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,310
yeah i got it baby yeah okay look wait
something is talking is what i can look

496
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
something is talking is what i can look

once right you only need to do requests
 

503
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,430
once right you only need to do requests
and after so that you will be one you'll

504
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
and after so that you will be one you'll
 

505
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,870
and after so that you will be one you'll
be what eric

506
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
be what eric
 

507
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,990
be what eric
it'll be much easier you'll be what

508
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
it'll be much easier you'll be what
 

509
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,910
it'll be much easier you'll be what
one two three four five right

510
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
one two three four five right
 

511
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,949
one two three four five right
right all right then if i want you

512
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
right all right then if i want you
 

513
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,790
right all right then if i want you
to find out how many numbers are bigger

514
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
to find out how many numbers are bigger
 

515
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,150
to find out how many numbers are bigger
than equal than two so

516
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
than equal than two so
 

517
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,230
than equal than two so
how how would you do it overly sorted

518
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
how how would you do it overly sorted
 

519
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,230
how how would you do it overly sorted
array okay

520
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
array okay
 

521
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,550
array okay
how would you do it if you're looking at

522
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
how would you do it if you're looking at
 

523
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,829
how would you do it if you're looking at
you split in half

524
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839

 

525
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:33,100

uh

526
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,110

 

527
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,030

[Music]

528
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040

 

529
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,750

that's very advanced okay i was going to

530
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
that's very advanced okay i was going to
 

531
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,190
that's very advanced okay i was going to
explain to that

532
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
explain to that
 

533
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,990
explain to that
later but but you got it straight first

534
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
later but but you got it straight first
 

535
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,870
later but but you got it straight first
of all if it's

536
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
of all if it's
 

537
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,030
of all if it's
sorted it's better than i can just do

538
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
sorted it's better than i can just do
 

539
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,470
sorted it's better than i can just do
this yeah i can just search from the

540
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
this yeah i can just search from the
 

541
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,150
this yeah i can just search from the
beginning yeah when i found these two

542
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
beginning yeah when i found these two
 

543
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,069
beginning yeah when i found these two
oh i can search here from the other

544
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
oh i can search here from the other
 

545
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,990
oh i can search here from the other
opposite what i found is

546
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
opposite what i found is
 

547
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,509
opposite what i found is
when i saw a number which is bigger

548
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
when i saw a number which is bigger
 

549
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,750
when i saw a number which is bigger
okay let's do this side which which is

550
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
okay let's do this side which which is
 

551
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,710
okay let's do this side which which is
bigger than two

552
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
bigger than two
 

553
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,829
bigger than two
right yeah and i don't need to continue

554
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
right yeah and i don't need to continue
 

555
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,470
right yeah and i don't need to continue
right

556
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,480

 

557
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,389

why is that because all the rest number

558
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
why is that because all the rest number
 

559
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,110
why is that because all the rest number
will be bigger than two i'm right

560
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,120
will be bigger than two i'm right
 

561
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,389
will be bigger than two i'm right
so i can exit the check earlier

562
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
so i can exit the check earlier
 

563
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,790
so i can exit the check earlier
yeah but the time complexity for this is

564
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
yeah but the time complexity for this is
 

565
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,470
yeah but the time complexity for this is
still on why is that

566
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
still on why is that
 

567
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,590
still on why is that
why oh because

568
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
why oh because
 

569
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,350
why oh because
yeah it might be the end right you still

570
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
yeah it might be the end right you still
 

571
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,949
yeah it might be the end right you still
need to go through the end right

572
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
need to go through the end right
 

573
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,110
need to go through the end right
way down okay but the other thing is we

574
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
way down okay but the other thing is we
 

575
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,110
way down okay but the other thing is we
can finally search for this one

576
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
can finally search for this one
 

577
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,910
can finally search for this one
so as you say i want to find a two yeah

578
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
so as you say i want to find a two yeah
 

579
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,629
so as you say i want to find a two yeah
and i

580
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
and i
 

581
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,110
and i
i can do this number with with finding

582
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
i can do this number with with finding
 

583
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,910
i can do this number with with finding
the number in

584
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
the number in
 

585
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,670
the number in
o log of k log n right yeah

586
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
o log of k log n right yeah
 

587
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,030
o log of k log n right yeah
that's much faster right in

588
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
that's much faster right in
 

589
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,310
that's much faster right in
in python we can use this function

590
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
in python we can use this function
 

591
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,670
in python we can use this function
so look it okay let me go ahead and say

592
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
so look it okay let me go ahead and say
 

593
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,110
so look it okay let me go ahead and say
if array is one two three four

594
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
if array is one two three four
 

595
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,870
if array is one two three four
five six okay it's sorted

596
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
five six okay it's sorted
 

597
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,870
five six okay it's sorted
and i want to find i want to find

598
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
and i want to find i want to find
 

599
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,350
and i want to find i want to find
how many numbers let's say i want to

600
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
how many numbers let's say i want to
 

601
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,870
how many numbers let's say i want to
find the

602
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
find the
 

603
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,509
find the
three okay i want to find the three so i

604
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
three okay i want to find the three so i
 

605
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,629
three okay i want to find the three so i
can use this function

606
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
can use this function
 

607
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,470
can use this function

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,590
is the position that is that if i want
to put the number

668
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
to put the number
 

669
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,790
to put the number
which is

670
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800

 

671
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,350

so i find this number here right and

672
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
so i find this number here right and
 

673
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,269
so i find this number here right and
then you tell me the position to put it

674
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
then you tell me the position to put it
 

675
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,069
then you tell me the position to put it
is here

676
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
is here
 

677
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,430
is here
so that's zero one two right

678
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
so that's zero one two right
 

679
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,430
so that's zero one two right
so you start from the left so yeah yeah

680
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
so you start from the left so yeah yeah
 

681

help
if this number is not not in the target

690
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
if this number is not not in the target
 

691
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,790
if this number is not not in the target
like if i want to find

692
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
like if i want to find
 

693
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,310
like if i want to find
three point five three point five

694
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320
three point five three point five
 

695
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,509
three point five three point five
yeah look

696
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
yeah look
 

697
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,150
yeah look
if it's 3.5 it's not in the sorted array

698
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
if it's 3.5 it's not in the sorted array
 

699
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,710
if it's 3.5 it's not in the sorted array
so

700
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
so
 

701
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,230
so
can you tell me can you point me to

702
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
can you tell me can you point me to
 

703
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,870
can you tell me can you point me to
where it is

704
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:25,880

 

705
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,990

interesting interesting you will be what

706
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
interesting interesting you will be what
 

707
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,829
interesting interesting you will be what
where you will be pointing 3.5 waist

708
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
where you will be pointing 3.5 waist
 

709
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,550
where you will be pointing 3.5 waist
again

710
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
again
 

711
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,110
again
let's say one is left yeah yeah yeah

712
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
let's say one is left yeah yeah yeah
 

713
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,310
let's say one is left yeah yeah yeah
yeah

714
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320

 

715
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,550

so you can think of that way you find

716
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
so you can think of that way you find
 

717
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,629
so you can think of that way you find
the petition to put 3.5

718
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
the petition to put 3.5
 

719
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,550
the petition to put 3.5
in and it's still sorted where it's

720
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
in and it's still sorted where it's
 

721
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,749
in and it's still sorted where it's
going to put

722
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
going to put
 

723
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,509
going to put
where are you going to put 3.5 3.5

724
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
where are you going to put 3.5 3.5
 

725
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,150
where are you going to put 3.5 3.5
you have to be here yeah we're done so

726
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
you have to be here yeah we're done so
 

727
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,030
you have to be here yeah we're done so
here you

728
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
here you
 

729
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,590
here you
can't find this but you can still find a

730
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
can't find this but you can still find a
 

731
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,550
can't find this but you can still find a
position

732
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
position
 

733
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,829
position
for 3.5 to e so that will be 0 1 2

734
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
for 3.5 to e so that will be 0 1 2
 

735
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,390
for 3.5 to e so that will be 0 1 2
right two zero

736
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
right two zero
 

737
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,309
right two zero
one two uh

738
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
one two uh
 

739
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,870
one two uh
actually you will be return three here

740
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
actually you will be return three here
 

741
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,150
actually you will be return three here
yeah because that three

742
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
yeah because that three
 

743
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,710
yeah because that three
index is going to play uh you want to

744
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
index is going to play uh you want to
 

745
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,069
index is going to play uh you want to
put a 3.5 in

746
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
put a 3.5 in
 

747
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,510
put a 3.5 in
index three and if it's bisect right

748
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
index three and if it's bisect right
 

749
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,710
index three and if it's bisect right
what does it mean you'll be here right

750
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
what does it mean you'll be here right
 

751
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,390
what does it mean you'll be here right
yeah all right yeah

752
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
yeah all right yeah
 

753
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,909
yeah all right yeah
3.5 you'll be putting pretty after right

754
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:31,919
3.5 you'll be putting pretty after right
 

755
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,950
3.5 you'll be putting pretty after right
got it

756
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
got it
 

757
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,470
got it
so how does that help if we we found

758
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
so how does that help if we we found
 

759
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,990
so how does that help if we we found
this number bicep

760
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
this number bicep
 

761
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,669
this number bicep
left okay aaron okay that's okay

762
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
left okay aaron okay that's okay
 

763
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,870
left okay aaron okay that's okay
if by say numbers k right

764
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
if by say numbers k right
 

765
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,990
if by say numbers k right
yeah all right what does it mean

766
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
yeah all right what does it mean
 

767
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,390
yeah all right what does it mean
k is spicy number okay if i put it here

768
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
k is spicy number okay if i put it here
 

769
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,390
k is spicy number okay if i put it here
so what does this mean how many numbers

770
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,400
so what does this mean how many numbers
 

771
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,430
so what does this mean how many numbers
that are bigger or less equal than k

772
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
that are bigger or less equal than k
 

773
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,070
that are bigger or less equal than k
can you tell me

774
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080

 

775
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,029

number is x yeah if this example is x so

776
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
number is x yeah if this example is x so
 

777
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,630
number is x yeah if this example is x so
how many numbers are bigger or

778
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
how many numbers are bigger or
 

779
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,390
how many numbers are bigger or
equal than k

780
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400

 

781
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,470

is this speed only speed

782
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480

 

783
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,590

the same no no in this case it's the

784
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
the same no no in this case it's the
 

785
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,310
the same no no in this case it's the
same i'm

786
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
same i'm
 

787
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,510
same i'm
talking about if if x equals by bisect

788
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
talking about if if x equals by bisect
 

789
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,430
talking about if if x equals by bisect
that's k

790
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
that's k
 

791
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,270
that's k
it means that i i can put a put a k

792
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
it means that i i can put a put a k
 

793
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,549
it means that i i can put a put a k
in a sorted array at the x position

794
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
in a sorted array at the x position
 

795
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,830
in a sorted array at the x position
so can you tell me

796
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840

 

797
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,110

there are x numbers bigger than k

798
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
there are x numbers bigger than k
 

799
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,590
there are x numbers bigger than k
x x number here bigger than k all they

800
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
x x number here bigger than k all they
 

801
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,150
x x number here bigger than k all they
are

802
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,160
are
 

803
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,630
are
n minus x number bigger than k which one

804
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
n minus x number bigger than k which one
 

805
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,909
n minus x number bigger than k which one
pick one if this is sorted

806
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
pick one if this is sorted
 

807
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,470
pick one if this is sorted
right just pick one come on you've got

808
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
right just pick one come on you've got
 

809
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,870
right just pick one come on you've got
15 percent

810
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
15 percent
 

811
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,150
15 percent
yeah x look

812
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,160
yeah x look
 

813
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,549
yeah x look
x is the number of positions to put the

814
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:02,559
x is the number of positions to put the
 

815
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,390
x is the number of positions to put the
k in this software array

816
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400
k in this software array
 

817
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,549
k in this software array
none of that i mean they're x numbers

818
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
none of that i mean they're x numbers
 

819
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,710
none of that i mean they're x numbers
bigger than equal and k all they are

820
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
bigger than equal and k all they are
 

821
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,430
bigger than equal and k all they are
m plus n minus x number bigger or equal

822
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
m plus n minus x number bigger or equal
 

823
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,990
m plus n minus x number bigger or equal
to k

824
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
to k
 

825
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,669
to k
and the numbers the numbers of elements

826
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:15,679
and the numbers the numbers of elements
 

827
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,870
and the numbers the numbers of elements
in this array

828
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
in this array
 

829
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,310
in this array
so i'm actually asking you is this bit

830
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
so i'm actually asking you is this bit
 

831
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,870
so i'm actually asking you is this bit
bigger than equal then k or is this bit

832
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:22,880
bigger than equal then k or is this bit
 

833
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,190
bigger than equal then k or is this bit
bigger or equal than k if i put the

834
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
bigger or equal than k if i put the
 

835
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,630
bigger or equal than k if i put the
if i find the position to put the k in

836
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
if i find the position to put the k in
 

837
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,150
if i find the position to put the k in
if it says salty come on it's very

838
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,160
if it says salty come on it's very
 

839
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,750
if it says salty come on it's very
obvious which bit

840
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760

 

841
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,830

let's supply the water come on why

842
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
let's supply the water come on why
 

843
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,990
let's supply the water come on why
right yeah of course why this big is

844
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
right yeah of course why this big is
 

845
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,310
right yeah of course why this big is
bigger i put a 3.5 here so how many

846
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,320
bigger i put a 3.5 here so how many
 

847
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,190
bigger i put a 3.5 here so how many
numbers are bigger

848
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
numbers are bigger
 

849
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,470
numbers are bigger
than equal than k of course here 0.56 is

850
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
than equal than k of course here 0.56 is
 

851
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,909
than equal than k of course here 0.56 is
bigger than k come out

852
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
bigger than k come out
 

853
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,350
bigger than k come out
yeah it's quite quite easier easily

854
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
yeah it's quite quite easier easily
 

855
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,870
yeah it's quite quite easier easily
significant okay so remember this

856
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
significant okay so remember this
 

857
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,549
significant okay so remember this
f function we can improve the time

858
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
f function we can improve the time
 

859
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,630
f function we can improve the time
complexity to what

860
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:00,640
complexity to what
 

861
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,149
complexity to what
with this function we can improve the

862
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
with this function we can improve the
 

863
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,390
with this function we can improve the
term complex to uh

864
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400

865
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,480

[Music]

868
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280

 

869
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,830

but remember we need to solve this uh

870
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
but remember we need to solve this uh
 

871
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,310
but remember we need to solve this uh
array

872
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
array
 

873
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,149
array
only once yeah we which it will take

874
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:22,159
only once yeah we which it will take
 

875
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,990
only once yeah we which it will take
oh

876
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000

 

877
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,190

wait for something okay now good

878
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
wait for something okay now good
 

879
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,909
wait for something okay now good
so what's the second part we can we can

880
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
so what's the second part we can we can
 

881
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,270
so what's the second part we can we can
optimize

882
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280
optimize
 

883
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,950
optimize
what's the second part we can optimize

884
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
what's the second part we can optimize
 

885
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,470
what's the second part we can optimize
remember we can we

886
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
remember we can we
 

887
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,870
remember we can we
iterate blue force from for the k from

888
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
iterate blue force from for the k from
 

889
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,750
iterate blue force from for the k from
zero to

890
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760
zero to
 

891
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,830
zero to
n right yes but we can finally search it

892
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
n right yes but we can finally search it
 

893
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,950
n right yes but we can finally search it
am right yes

894
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:46,960
am right yes
 

895
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,270
am right yes
yeah am i we can finally research it all

896
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,280
yeah am i we can finally research it all
 

897
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,470
yeah am i we can finally research it all
right

898
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:52,480

 

899
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,310

so um

900
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,320

 

901
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,310

actually wait wait should we actually

902
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
actually wait wait should we actually
 

903
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,710
actually wait wait should we actually
can you pay attention actually the k the

904
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
can you pay attention actually the k the
 

905
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,669
can you pay attention actually the k the
upper bound of k

906
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
upper bound of k
 

907
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,630
upper bound of k
is what it's not the number of elements

908
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
is what it's not the number of elements
 

909
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,549
is what it's not the number of elements
i made a mistake earlier

910
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
i made a mistake earlier
 

911
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,669
i made a mistake earlier
right look five three

912
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
right look five three
 

913
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,909
right look five three
zero nine what's the maximum k you are

914
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
zero nine what's the maximum k you are
 

915
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:14,950
zero nine what's the maximum k you are
talking about here no

916
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
talking about here no
 

917
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,430
talking about here no
it's not four it's nine right yeah i

918
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,440
it's not four it's nine right yeah i
 

919
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,149
it's not four it's nine right yeah i
said knowing

920
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:18,159
said knowing
 

921
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,669
said knowing
yeah okay right because the k

922
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
yeah okay right because the k
 

923
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,029
yeah okay right because the k
k the maximum is nine is the maximum of

924
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039
k the maximum is nine is the maximum of
 

925
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,830
k the maximum is nine is the maximum of
numbers

926
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
numbers
 

927
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,110
numbers
right all right it's not actually the

928
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,120
right all right it's not actually the
 

929
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,870
right all right it's not actually the
length of numbers right this is the

930
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
length of numbers right this is the
 

931
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,230
length of numbers right this is the
upper bound right

932
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,240
upper bound right
 

933
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,230
upper bound right
yeah so let's negotiate before the

934
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,240
yeah so let's negotiate before the
 

935
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,430
yeah so let's negotiate before the
truthful thing is

936
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
truthful thing is
 

937
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,310
truthful thing is
is what o max k

938
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
is what o max k
 

939
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,750
is what o max k
o max o max n times

940
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:43,760
o max o max n times
 

941
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,070
o max o max n times
n right then the beginning it's not o n

942
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,080
n right then the beginning it's not o n
 

943
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,789
n right then the beginning it's not o n
squared right

944
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
squared right
 

945
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,669
squared right
it's omax n times n could be could be

946
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:49,679
it's omax n times n could be could be
 

947
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,669
it's omax n times n could be could be
bigger than o n squared all right

948
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
bigger than o n squared all right
 

949
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,669
bigger than o n squared all right
yeah so now we can finally search this

950
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
yeah so now we can finally search this
 

951
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,070
yeah so now we can finally search this
bit

952
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
bit
 

953
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,390
bit
instead of linear search that's what i'm

954
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,400
instead of linear search that's what i'm
 

955
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,789
instead of linear search that's what i'm
saying the lowest will be n the biggest

956
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
saying the lowest will be n the biggest
 

957
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,830
saying the lowest will be n the biggest
one is the

958
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
one is the
 

959
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,549
one is the
next n and then we can finally search

960
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
next n and then we can finally search
 

961
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,110
next n and then we can finally search
this one

962
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
this one
 

963
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,549
this one
and then this will be o o

964
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
and then this will be o o
 

965
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,230
and then this will be o o
log max n right no of

966
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
log max n right no of
 

967
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,230
log max n right no of
max n and then times

968
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240

 

969
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,789

what's the f function times 1 what

970
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
what's the f function times 1 what
 

971
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,669
what's the f function times 1 what
what's that yeah

972
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
what's that yeah
 

973
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,990
what's that yeah
it could be great if we can reduce it to

974
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,000
it could be great if we can reduce it to
 

975
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,870
it could be great if we can reduce it to
0 1 but

976
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
0 1 but
 

977
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,909
0 1 but
it's not possible

978
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919

 

979
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,190

oh log what the

980
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200
oh log what the
 

981
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,990
oh log what the
number of elements right o log n so the

982
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
number of elements right o log n so the
 

983
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,710
number of elements right o log n so the
overtime complexity will be this one

984
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
overtime complexity will be this one
 

985
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,149
overtime complexity will be this one
o log max n times low log n right

986
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
o log max n times low log n right
 

987
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,870
o log max n times low log n right
so hold on yeah yeah how can we finally

988
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
so hold on yeah yeah how can we finally
 

989
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,350
so hold on yeah yeah how can we finally
search this okay i'll show you

990
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,360

 

991
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,190

okay i'm almost finished yeah almost me

992
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,200
okay i'm almost finished yeah almost me
 

993
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,830
okay i'm almost finished yeah almost me
look at me right

994
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840
look at me right
 

995
00:22:52,840 --> 00:23:04,470
look at me right
now

996
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:04,480

00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:53,279
divided by 2.
 

1035
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,870
divided by 2.
divided by 2. you need to divide the

1036
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
divided by 2. you need to divide the
 

1037
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,190
divided by 2. you need to divide the
random yeah i just said that bit

1038
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
random yeah i just said that bit
 

1039
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,029
random yeah i just said that bit
i don't have a divided by 2 bit okay

1040
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:01,039
i don't have a divided by 2 bit okay
 

1041
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:13,430
i don't have a divided by 2 bit okay
okay all right

1042
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440

 

1043
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,029

okay k equals actually

1044
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
okay k equals actually
 

1045
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,950
okay k equals actually
this meter is k k uh equals one

1046
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
this meter is k k uh equals one
 

1047
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,990
this meter is k k uh equals one
f mid middle i

1048
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,000
f mid middle i
 

1049
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,029
f mid middle i
yeah okay okay if k

1050
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
yeah okay okay if k
 

1051
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,029
yeah okay okay if k
equals middle if k equals neither

1052
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:31,039
equals middle if k equals neither
 

1053
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,190
equals middle if k equals neither
yeah we found it right before the answer

1054
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,200
yeah we found it right before the answer
 

1055
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,230
yeah we found it right before the answer
yeah return k

1056
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,240
yeah return k
 

1057
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,789
yeah return k
right yeah this is the number we're

1058
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
right yeah this is the number we're
 

1059
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,070
right yeah this is the number we're
looking for right

1060
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
looking for right
 

1061
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,669
looking for right
then if if this

1062
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
then if if this
 

1063
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,830
then if if this
k is smaller than

1064
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,840
k is smaller than
 

1065
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:55,610
k is smaller than
middle

1066
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:55,620

 

1067
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,830

[Music]

1068
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840
[Music]
 

1069
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,390
[Music]
is right

1070
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
is right
 

1071
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,149
is right
minus equals right equals

1072
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
minus equals right equals
 

1073
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,590
minus equals right equals
middle minus one else left

1074
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,600
middle minus one else left
 

1075
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,190
middle minus one else left
equals middle plus one

1076
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
equals middle plus one
 

1077
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,549
equals middle plus one
and we turn in here

1078
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
and we turn in here
 

1079
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,230
and we turn in here
okay so can you explain to me why is

1080
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
okay so can you explain to me why is
 

1081
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,830
okay so can you explain to me why is
this if k

1082
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:17,840
this if k
 

1083
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,870
this if k
is smaller than middle so

1084
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
is smaller than middle so
 

1085
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,149
is smaller than middle so
if if this if they are less if they are

1086
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:24,159
if if this if they are less if they are
 

1087
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,190
if if this if they are less if they are
less number than meat which is

1088
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
less number than meat which is
 

1089
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,230
less number than meat which is
is smaller or equal than

1090
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
is smaller or equal than
 

1091
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,510
is smaller or equal than
the meat number we need to

1092
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
the meat number we need to
 

1093
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,070
the meat number we need to
reduce the number of k right so it will

1094
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
reduce the number of k right so it will
 

1095
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,830
reduce the number of k right so it will
make it bigger you will be bought more

1096
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
make it bigger you will be bought more
 

1097
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,390
make it bigger you will be bought more
right

1098
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
right
 

1099
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,470
right
all right can you this is a bit tricky

1100
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,480
all right can you this is a bit tricky
 

1101
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,149
all right can you this is a bit tricky
to understand look eric

1102
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:42,159
to understand look eric
 

1103
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,350
to understand look eric
if the meat if the meat

1104
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,360
if the meat if the meat
 

1105
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,870
if the meat if the meat
equals k great we found it but if k

1106
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
equals k great we found it but if k
 

1107
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,430
equals k great we found it but if k
is smaller than the meter what does it

1108
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
is smaller than the meter what does it
 

1109
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,549
is smaller than the meter what does it
mean

1110
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
mean
 

1111
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,830
mean
what does it mean anyway k is here k is

1112
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
what does it mean anyway k is here k is
 

1113
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,789
what does it mean anyway k is here k is
here

1114
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:56,799
here
 

1115
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,149
here
if they um okay if they are k

1116
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159
if they um okay if they are k
 

1117
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,269
if they um okay if they are k
numbers which are bigger or equal

1118
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
numbers which are bigger or equal
 

1119
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,830
numbers which are bigger or equal
than k which is smaller than expected

1120
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:08,840
than k which is smaller than expected
 

1121
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,909
than k which is smaller than expected
right which is smaller than expected so

1122
00:26:11,909 --> 00:26:11,919
right which is smaller than expected so
 

1123
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,230
right which is smaller than expected so
we want to

1124
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,240
we want to
 

1125
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,990
we want to
if k is smaller than the expected

1126
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000

 

1127
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,549

k is the answer if there are number of

1128
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:22,559
k is the answer if there are number of
 

1129
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,950
k is the answer if there are number of
numbers which are smaller

1130
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
numbers which are smaller
 

1131
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,990
numbers which are smaller
k is is smaller than expected so what do

1132
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
k is is smaller than expected so what do
 

1133
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,789
k is is smaller than expected so what do
we do

1134
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:28,799
we do
 

1135
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,510
we do
we need to increa reduce the meat right

1136
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
we need to increa reduce the meat right
 

1137
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,310
we need to increa reduce the meat right
we need to

1138
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
we need to
 

1139
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,230
we need to
search in the lower half here right so

1140
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,240
search in the lower half here right so
 

1141
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,909
search in the lower half here right so
the k will be bigger

1142
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:35,919
the k will be bigger
 

1143
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,430
the k will be bigger
right all right

1144
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,440

 

1145
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,470

if k is bigger on the other hand if k

1146
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
if k is bigger on the other hand if k
 

1147
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,590
if k is bigger on the other hand if k
is bigger we want to increase that we

1148
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
is bigger we want to increase that we
 

1149
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,269
is bigger we want to increase that we
want to search in this bit

1150
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:47,279
want to search in this bit
 

1151
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,510
want to search in this bit
so that next time k will be smaller

1152
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
so that next time k will be smaller
 

1153
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,310
so that next time k will be smaller
right

1154
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
right
 

1155
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,669
right
click and we can finally search this bit

1156
00:26:53,669 --> 00:26:53,679
click and we can finally search this bit
 

1157
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,310
click and we can finally search this bit
so l these this angle will be o

1158
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
so l these this angle will be o
 

1159
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,310
so l these this angle will be o
log max

1160
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,320
log max
 

1161
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,310
log max
nums yeah and times here this function

1162
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:06,320

1171
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,110
okay oh look maxon logan what's the
space complexity

1172
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120

 

1173
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,269

to understand what's here how do you

1176
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:30,960
to understand what's here how do you
 

1177
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,350
to understand what's here how do you
calculate the middle

1178
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,360
calculate the middle
 

1179
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,430
calculate the middle
middle yeah

1180
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:37,440

 

1181
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,549

yeah it's been 27 minutes

1182
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:40,559
yeah it's been 27 minutes
 

1183
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,990
yeah it's been 27 minutes
yes thank you for counting i already

1184
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,000
yes thank you for counting i already
 

1185
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,350
yes thank you for counting i already
know that

1186
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
know that
 

1187
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,990
know that
i didn't know that without looking

1188
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,000

 

1189
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,430

yeah 27 yeah left one

1190
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
yeah 27 yeah left one
 

1191
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,510
yeah 27 yeah left one
how do you calculate the meter from the

1192
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:55,520
how do you calculate the meter from the
 

1193
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,590
how do you calculate the meter from the
left and right add

1194
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
left and right add
 

1195
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,630
left and right add
right and then divide by two

1196
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
right and then divide by two
 

1197
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,549
right and then divide by two
but you need to break it right otherwise

1198
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:02,559
but you need to break it right otherwise
 

1199
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,870
but you need to break it right otherwise
the these will calculate first left plus

1200
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:04,880
the these will calculate first left plus
 

1201
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,350
the these will calculate first left plus
y

1202
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,360
y
 

1203
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,990
y
bracket do you understand yeah whatever

1204
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,000
bracket do you understand yeah whatever
 

1205
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,549
bracket do you understand yeah whatever
you say

1206
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:08,559
you say
 

1207
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:15,279
you say
yes bye okay bye bye bye bye
