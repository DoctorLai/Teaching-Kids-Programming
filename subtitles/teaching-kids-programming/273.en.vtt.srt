1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,629

hello

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:02,639
hello
 

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,590
hello
hello mr evie someone all right

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:05,600
hello mr evie someone all right
 

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,630
hello mr evie someone all right
yeah

6
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:06,640
yeah
 

7
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,950
yeah
okay so we talk about a

8
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:08,960
okay so we talk about a
 

9
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,390
okay so we talk about a
graph problem today graph what's graph

10
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
graph problem today graph what's graph
 

11
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,950
graph problem today graph what's graph
g yeah what's going on what does it have

12
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
g yeah what's going on what does it have
 

13
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,990
g yeah what's going on what does it have
how do we represent a graph

14
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
how do we represent a graph
 

15
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,710
how do we represent a graph
what do we have for graph actually

16
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
what do we have for graph actually
 

17
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,509
what do we have for graph actually
no no i'm saying is the graph in text

18
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
no no i'm saying is the graph in text
 

19
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,269
no no i'm saying is the graph in text
and vertex and edges yeah it's a

20
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
and vertex and edges yeah it's a
 

21
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,509
and vertex and edges yeah it's a
collection of vertex and edges

22
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
collection of vertex and edges
 

23
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,750
collection of vertex and edges
so let's use the vertex like look zero

24
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
so let's use the vertex like look zero
 

25
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,950
so let's use the vertex like look zero
one

26
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
one
 

27
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,030
one
and then two here look at this is the

28
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
and then two here look at this is the
 

29
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,430
and then two here look at this is the
graph a tree is also a graph

30
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
graph a tree is also a graph
 

31
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,150
graph a tree is also a graph
so look if the graph doesn't have these

32
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
so look if the graph doesn't have these
 

33
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,229
so look if the graph doesn't have these
errors yeah it doesn't have errors we

34
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
errors yeah it doesn't have errors we
 

35
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,430
errors yeah it doesn't have errors we
call it

36
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
call it
 

37
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,869
call it
what

38
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
what
 

39
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,029
what
we call it what graph if we have errors

40
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
we call it what graph if we have errors
 

41
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,549
we call it what graph if we have errors
we call it directional graph yeah

42
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
we call it directional graph yeah
 

43
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,750
we call it directional graph yeah
remember

44
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
remember
 

45
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,670
remember
direction of god do you still remember

46
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
direction of god do you still remember
 

47
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,670
direction of god do you still remember
d-a-g

48
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
d-a-g
 

49
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,270
d-a-g
yeah what's the

50
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280

 

51
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,590

girls energy what's a cyclic name it

52
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
girls energy what's a cyclic name it
 

53
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,790
girls energy what's a cyclic name it
doesn't go

54
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
doesn't go
 

55
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,110
doesn't go
like around the world

56
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
like around the world
 

57
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,189
like around the world
it doesn't have it's not like that right

58
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
it doesn't have it's not like that right
 

59
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,789
it doesn't have it's not like that right
if it's a graph is that one zero one two

60
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
if it's a graph is that one zero one two
 

61
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,750
if it's a graph is that one zero one two
zero two one one two two two one and it

62
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
zero two one one two two two one and it
 

63
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,670
zero two one one two two two one and it
forms a cycle that's the side but the

64
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
forms a cycle that's the side but the
 

65
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,590
forms a cycle that's the side but the
cycle is it doesn't have something like

66
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
cycle is it doesn't have something like
 

67
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,109
cycle is it doesn't have something like
that okay

68
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
that okay
 

69
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,030
that okay
so we given today we talk about this

70
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
so we given today we talk about this
 

71
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,030
so we given today we talk about this
graph which is undirectional which means

72
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
graph which is undirectional which means
 

73
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,550
graph which is undirectional which means
that you know it's bi-directional you

74
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
that you know it's bi-directional you
 

75
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,030
that you know it's bi-directional you
can do it as bi-directional

76
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
can do it as bi-directional
 

77
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,429
can do it as bi-directional
know is uh let's say if zero is

78
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
know is uh let's say if zero is
 

79
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,109
know is uh let's say if zero is
connected to one one is also connected

80
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
connected to one one is also connected
 

81
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,230
connected to one one is also connected
to zero so let's save a friend okay

82
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
to zero so let's save a friend okay
 

83
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,630
to zero so let's save a friend okay
friends yellow is

84
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
friends yellow is
 

85
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,670
friends yellow is
friends your friend zero is

86
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
friends your friend zero is
 

87
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,550
friends your friend zero is
is uh has a friend one

one is friend of two two is friend of
one so can you tell me in these uh these

102
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
one so can you tell me in these uh these
 

103
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,950
one so can you tell me in these uh these
three people

104
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
three people
 

105
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,990
three people
at least each for each people

106
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
at least each for each people
 

107
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,109
at least each for each people
and these own at least one friend right

108
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
and these own at least one friend right
 

109
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,109
and these own at least one friend right
yeah you see two of us this statement

110
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
yeah you see two of us this statement
 

111
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,630
yeah you see two of us this statement
everybody has at least one friend in

112
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
everybody has at least one friend in
 

113
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,229
everybody has at least one friend in
this one yeah yeah okay and how about it

114
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
this one yeah yeah okay and how about it
 

115
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,630
this one yeah yeah okay and how about it
zero to one

116
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
zero to one
 

117
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,589
zero to one
uh

118
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
uh
 

119
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,710
uh
and two

120
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
and two
 

121
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,030
and two
everybody is everybody having one at

122
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
everybody is everybody having one at
 

123
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,190
everybody is everybody having one at
least one friend right no which one

124
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
least one friend right no which one
 

125
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,949
least one friend right no which one
doesn't have one edition two yeah

126
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
doesn't have one edition two yeah
 

127
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,430
doesn't have one edition two yeah
obviously okay so

128
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
obviously okay so
 

129
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,750
obviously okay so
what's your thoughts i mean remember a

130
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
what's your thoughts i mean remember a
 

131
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,270
what's your thoughts i mean remember a
few days ago we talked about a data

132
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
few days ago we talked about a data
 

133
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,630
few days ago we talked about a data
structure what what is it called

134
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
structure what what is it called
 

135
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,869
structure what what is it called
set this joint set yeah this joint says

136
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
set this joint set yeah this joint says
 

137
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,470
set this joint set yeah this joint says
so what can we do with the disjoint set

138
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
so what can we do with the disjoint set
 

139
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,790
so what can we do with the disjoint set
we what can we do with patients remember

140
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
we what can we do with patients remember
 

141
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,270
we what can we do with patients remember
we use that digion set to to do what to

142
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
we use that digion set to to do what to
 

143
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,110
we use that digion set to to do what to
solve this problem to finding if there's

144
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
solve this problem to finding if there's
 

145
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,190
solve this problem to finding if there's
a path between a source to the target

146
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
a path between a source to the target
 

147
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,949
a path between a source to the target
right so look

148
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
right so look
 

149
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,910
right so look
one two zero one two and then three four

150
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
one two zero one two and then three four
 

151
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,470
one two zero one two and then three four
we want to find out if there's a path

152
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
we want to find out if there's a path
 

153
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,270
we want to find out if there's a path
remember from zero to four

154
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
remember from zero to four
 

155
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,750
remember from zero to four
right so we create a disjoint set and

156
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
right so we create a disjoint set and
 

157
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,790
right so we create a disjoint set and
every time there's an edge what do we do

158
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
every time there's an edge what do we do
 

159
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,550
every time there's an edge what do we do
we merge the

160
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
we merge the
 

161
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,470
we merge the
we merge zero and one into one group

162
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
we merge zero and one into one group
 

163
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,910
we merge zero and one into one group
right all right

164
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
right all right
 

165
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,830
right all right
and then it's the last edge between one

166
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
and then it's the last edge between one
 

167
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,550
and then it's the last edge between one
to two we merge it yeah and if there's a

168
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
to two we merge it yeah and if there's a
 

169
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,190
to two we merge it yeah and if there's a
path between three to four we merge it

170
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
path between three to four we merge it
 

171
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,110
path between three to four we merge it
right we merge it into one group and at

172
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
right we merge it into one group and at
 

173
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,509
right we merge it into one group and at
least at last we check if the source and

174
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
least at last we check if the source and
 

175
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,190
least at last we check if the source and
the target belongs to the same group

176
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
the target belongs to the same group
 

177
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,790
the target belongs to the same group
right we don't stand saying if it's not

178
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
right we don't stand saying if it's not
 

179
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,710
right we don't stand saying if it's not
belongs to same group what does it mean

180
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
belongs to same group what does it mean
 

181
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,390
belongs to same group what does it mean
it means that there's a path between the

182
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400
it means that there's a path between the
 

183
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,190
it means that there's a path between the
source to attack otherwise it's

184
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
source to attack otherwise it's
 

185
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,390
source to attack otherwise it's
it's not possible right because

186
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
it's not possible right because
 

187
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,990
it's not possible right because
disconnected look there's no path

188
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
disconnected look there's no path
 

189
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,750
disconnected look there's no path
between zero to four right because it's

190
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
between zero to four right because it's
 

191
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,990
between zero to four right because it's
connected so can we use this digion set

192
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
connected so can we use this digion set
 

193
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,149
connected so can we use this digion set
to solve this problem

194
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
to solve this problem
 

195
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,229
to solve this problem
it's quite similar but

196
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
it's quite similar but
 

197
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,110
it's quite similar but
very

198
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
very
 

199
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,149
very
i mean

200
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
i mean
 

201
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,670
i mean
there's something very

202
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
there's something very
 

203
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,390
there's something very
uh slightly different

204
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
uh slightly different
 

205
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,869
uh slightly different
so eric look so what's your thought can

206
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
so eric look so what's your thought can
 

207
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,949
so eric look so what's your thought can
we use the distro set

208
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
we use the distro set
 

209
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,270
we use the distro set
so what is john said we can merge we can

210
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
so what is john said we can merge we can
 

211
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,949
so what is john said we can merge we can
merge two vertex

212
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
merge two vertex
 

213
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,429
merge two vertex
most of our we can check if two vertex

214
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
most of our we can check if two vertex
 

215
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,070
most of our we can check if two vertex
belongs to the same group right

216
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
belongs to the same group right
 

217
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,949
belongs to the same group right
yeah

218
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
yeah
 

219
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,350
yeah
and we can find we can check if the the

220
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
and we can find we can check if the the
 

221
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,110
and we can find we can check if the the
connected group the group sound the

222
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
connected group the group sound the
 

223
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,550
connected group the group sound the
number of groups yeah the number of

224
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
number of groups yeah the number of
 

225
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,589
number of groups yeah the number of
groups

226
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
groups
 

227
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,630
groups
we can get this and what else yeah

228
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
we can get this and what else yeah
 

229
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,030
we can get this and what else yeah
yeah we can find a parent

230
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
yeah we can find a parent
 

231
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,110
yeah we can find a parent
find a group number for five kilometer

232
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
find a group number for five kilometer
 

233
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,949
find a group number for five kilometer
five group which group it belongs to all

234
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
five group which group it belongs to all
 

235
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:15,670
five group which group it belongs to all
right

236
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
right
 

237
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,710
right
so

238
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
so
 

239
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,629
so
can we use this for to solve this

240
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
can we use this for to solve this
 

241
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,590
can we use this for to solve this
problem

242
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
problem
 

243
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,310
problem
any idea what's your thoughts

244
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
any idea what's your thoughts
 

245
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,629
any idea what's your thoughts
what what's your thinking

246
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
what what's your thinking
 

247
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,189
what what's your thinking
how do we find out if only if everybody

248
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
how do we find out if only if everybody
 

249
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,189
how do we find out if only if everybody
has at least one friend

250
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
has at least one friend
 

251
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,270
has at least one friend
at least one friend right

252
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
at least one friend right
 

253
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,030
at least one friend right
so at least one friend we can think

254
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
so at least one friend we can think
 

255
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,150
so at least one friend we can think
about at least one edge yeah

256
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
about at least one edge yeah
 

257
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,030
about at least one edge yeah
okay

258
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
okay
 

259
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,909
okay
so

260
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
so
 

261
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,070
so
what's your song any idea

262
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
what's your song any idea
 

263
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,629
what's your song any idea
i think it's something

264
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
i think it's something
 

265
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,030
i think it's something
don't worry just uh think about uh just

266
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
don't worry just uh think about uh just
 

267
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,629
don't worry just uh think about uh just
talk about what's your sauce any sauce

268
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
talk about what's your sauce any sauce
 

269
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,629
talk about what's your sauce any sauce
how is something

270
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
how is something
 

271
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,629
how is something
you don't have sauce so can we use these

272
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
you don't have sauce so can we use these
 

273
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,150
you don't have sauce so can we use these
dishes

274
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
dishes
 

275
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,070
dishes
yes

276
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080

 

277
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,830

if you don't have any sauce what's the

278
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
if you don't have any sauce what's the
 

279
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,469
if you don't have any sauce what's the
first thing you need to check

280
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
first thing you need to check
 

281
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,749
first thing you need to check
source b

282
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759

 

283
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,710

b

284
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720

 

285
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,990

the question the question is to ask

286
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
the question the question is to ask
 

287
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,629
the question the question is to ask
if everybody has at least one friend so

288
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
if everybody has at least one friend so
 

289
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,350
if everybody has at least one friend so
we just need to go through everybody

290
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
we just need to go through everybody
 

291
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,150
we just need to go through everybody
right oh yeah and then check if it has

292
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
right oh yeah and then check if it has
 

293
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,150
right oh yeah and then check if it has
one friend right

294
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
one friend right
 

295
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,390
one friend right
oh yeah so how do we check if everyone's

296
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
oh yeah so how do we check if everyone's
 

297
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,350
oh yeah so how do we check if everyone's
friends so if we process this graph

298
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
friends so if we process this graph
 

299
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,270
friends so if we process this graph
into a

300
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
into a
 

301
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,189
into a
headset right we can just use a hashtag

302
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
headset right we can just use a hashtag
 

303
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,710
headset right we can just use a hashtag
uh uh

304
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
uh uh
 

305
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,189
uh uh
to store these the what key is that

306
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
to store these the what key is that
 

307
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,590
to store these the what key is that
remember key is the vertex

308
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
remember key is the vertex
 

309
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,070
remember key is the vertex
vertex and the value

310
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
vertex and the value
 

311
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,830
vertex and the value
is a list

312
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
is a list
 

313
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,230
is a list
of edges it points to right

314
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
of edges it points to right
 

315
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,670
of edges it points to right
x is equal to list of vertex okay vertex

316
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
x is equal to list of vertex okay vertex
 

317
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,029
x is equal to list of vertex okay vertex
is connected to

318
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
is connected to
 

319
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,189
is connected to
so if we pre-process these edges into

320
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
so if we pre-process these edges into
 

321
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,110
so if we pre-process these edges into
this adjacent linked list we call

322
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
this adjacent linked list we call
 

323
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,430
this adjacent linked list we call
adjacent inputs then we check we go

324
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
adjacent inputs then we check we go
 

325
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,909
adjacent inputs then we check we go
through each we go through each vertex

326
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
through each we go through each vertex
 

327
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,950
through each we go through each vertex
right

328
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
right
 

329
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,790
right
and then check

330
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
and then check
 

331
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,909
and then check
and then check what and i check if it's

332
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919

 

333
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,390

if the list the size is more than one

334
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
if the list the size is more than one
 

335
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,150
if the list the size is more than one
right if it's no more than one if it's

336
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
right if it's no more than one if it's
 

337
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,430
right if it's no more than one if it's
yellow what does it mean it doesn't have

338
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
yellow what does it mean it doesn't have
 

339
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,510
yellow what does it mean it doesn't have
any connection to other people right

340
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
any connection to other people right
 

341
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,070
any connection to other people right
right yeah so remember if we give you

342
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
right yeah so remember if we give you
 

343
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,230
right yeah so remember if we give you
this zero to one you need to also

344
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
this zero to one you need to also
 

345
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,629
this zero to one you need to also
pre-process this one to zero okay and

346
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
pre-process this one to zero okay and
 

347
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,790
pre-process this one to zero okay and
then you go through the each one and

348
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
then you go through the each one and
 

349
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,710
then you go through the each one and
then let's say the time conduct stays

350
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
then let's say the time conduct stays
 

351
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,350
then let's say the time conduct stays
over if the end vertex what's the term

352
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
over if the end vertex what's the term
 

353
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,670
over if the end vertex what's the term
complexity

354
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
complexity
 

355
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,390
complexity
what's the time complexity

356
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
what's the time complexity
 

357
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,110
what's the time complexity
of our m square

358
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
of our m square
 

359
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,189
of our m square
oh well it's going through each vertex

360
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
oh well it's going through each vertex
 

361
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,110
oh well it's going through each vertex
but how do we check if there's a

362
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
but how do we check if there's a
 

363
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,629
but how do we check if there's a
connection or no we just check need to

364
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
connection or no we just check need to
 

365
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,390
connection or no we just check need to
check the length of

366
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
check the length of
 

367
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,950
check the length of
yeah this is a one so all n times a one

368
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
yeah this is a one so all n times a one
 

369
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,230
yeah this is a one so all n times a one
equals one

370
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
equals one
 

371
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,150
equals one
yeah okay that's one solution that's

372
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
yeah okay that's one solution that's
 

373
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,749
yeah okay that's one solution that's
root four thing it's good enough yeah

374
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
root four thing it's good enough yeah
 

375
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,510
root four thing it's good enough yeah
but we'll talk about using this this

376
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
but we'll talk about using this this
 

377
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,350
but we'll talk about using this this
joint set how do we pitch again

378
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
joint set how do we pitch again
 

379
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,309
joint set how do we pitch again
if we

380
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
if we
 

381
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,189
if we
it

382
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
it
 

383
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,710
it
it's fine

384
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
it's fine
 

385
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,909
it's fine
yeah it's fine

386
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
yeah it's fine
 

387
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,909
yeah it's fine
yeah here is more solutions there so

388
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
yeah here is more solutions there so
 

389
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,589
yeah here is more solutions there so
this shows that we create the distance

390
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
this shows that we create the distance
 

391
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,350
this shows that we create the distance
that we merge it yeah we merge it like

392
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
that we merge it yeah we merge it like
 

393
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,070
that we merge it yeah we merge it like
that right but look we're not checking

394
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
that right but look we're not checking
 

395
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,629
that right but look we're not checking
this group right we are not checking the

396
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
this group right we are not checking the
 

397
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,990
this group right we are not checking the
same group right

398
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
same group right
 

399
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,070
same group right
we are not checking the look this is two

400
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
we are not checking the look this is two
 

401
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,670
we are not checking the look this is two
group right

402
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
group right
 

403
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,469
group right
yeah

404
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
yeah
 

405
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,950
yeah
but how about this this two group you

406
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
but how about this this two group you
 

407
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,029
but how about this this two group you
need to tell me is true is false because

408
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
need to tell me is true is false because
 

409
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,189
need to tell me is true is false because
two doesn't have any friend how about is

410
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
two doesn't have any friend how about is
 

411
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,189
two doesn't have any friend how about is
zero to one

412
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
zero to one
 

413
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,390
zero to one
and then one to two uh two to three

414
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
and then one to two uh two to three
 

415
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,430
and then one to two uh two to three
you see

416
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
you see
 

417
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,550
you see
still two groups but at least everybody

418
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
still two groups but at least everybody
 

419
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,469
still two groups but at least everybody
has at least one friend you see

420
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
has at least one friend you see
 

421
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,589
has at least one friend you see
right

422
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
right
 

423
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,550
right
okay so so this is the

424
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
okay so so this is the
 

425
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,550
okay so so this is the
this is irrelevant to the group right

426
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
this is irrelevant to the group right
 

427
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,350
this is irrelevant to the group right
number of groups so how can we do this

428
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360

 

429
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,670

no no no we need to find out the parent

430
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
no no no we need to find out the parent
 

431
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,189
no no no we need to find out the parent
the group

432
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
the group
 

433
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,150
the group
so if we find all the group the groups

434
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
so if we find all the group the groups
 

435
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,309
so if we find all the group the groups
for each vertex and then

436
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
for each vertex and then
 

437
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,189
for each vertex and then
look

438
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:01,199
look
 

439
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,110
look
how many groups how many groups does it

440
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
how many groups how many groups does it
 

441
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,640
how many groups how many groups does it
belongs to

442
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:04,650
belongs to
 

443
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,830
belongs to
[Music]

444
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
[Music]
 

445
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,710
[Music]
two right two look this is one if this

446
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
two right two look this is one if this
 

447
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,070
two right two look this is one if this
group one

448
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
group one
 

449
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,950
group one
group a right a a b b

450
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960

 

451
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,950

okay so what does this mean so you see

452
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
okay so what does this mean so you see
 

453
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,390
okay so what does this mean so you see
every

454
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
every
 

455
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,270
every
uh the group number needs to be at least

456
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
uh the group number needs to be at least
 

457
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,309
uh the group number needs to be at least
at least

458
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
at least
 

459
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,510
at least
two right

460
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
two right
 

461
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,589
two right
and how about this even if he's

462
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
and how about this even if he's
 

463
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,029
and how about this even if he's
4 here i know this is group c c

464
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
4 here i know this is group c c
 

465
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,670
4 here i know this is group c c
only appears once right so if we can do

466
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
only appears once right so if we can do
 

467
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,550
only appears once right so if we can do
this

468
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
this
 

469
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,550
this
we can find we can put it in the counter

470
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
we can find we can put it in the counter
 

471
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,149
we can find we can put it in the counter
right and we cop we just

472
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159

 

473
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,469

we just check the values

474
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
we just check the values
 

475
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,230
we just check the values
the key is the goal number the value is

476
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
the key is the goal number the value is
 

477
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,310
the key is the goal number the value is
the number of times the number of vertex

478
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:44,320
the number of times the number of vertex
 

479
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,710
the number of times the number of vertex
it belongs to right if

480
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
it belongs to right if
 

481
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,750
it belongs to right if
uh if the value is one what does it mean

482
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
uh if the value is one what does it mean
 

483
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,590
uh if the value is one what does it mean
if the word value is one what does it

484
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
if the word value is one what does it
 

485
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,990
if the word value is one what does it
mean there is only one friend there's a

486
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
mean there is only one friend there's a
 

487
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,750
mean there is only one friend there's a
friend which doesn't have any friends

488
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
friend which doesn't have any friends
 

489
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,949
friend which doesn't have any friends
right

490
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
right
 

491
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,630
right
that's why the girl number is one

492
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
that's why the girl number is one
 

493
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,150
that's why the girl number is one
because there's no other friend who

494
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
because there's no other friend who
 

495
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,470
because there's no other friend who
shares the same group okay so let's do

496
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
shares the same group okay so let's do
 

497
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,750
shares the same group okay so let's do
this

498
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
this
 

499
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,829
this
it should be very easy right let's say

500
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
it should be very easy right let's say
 

501
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,829
it should be very easy right let's say
define

502
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
define
 

503
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,190
define
uh check okay let's just call it

504
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
uh check okay let's just call it
 

505
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,030
uh check okay let's just call it
function full

506
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
function full
 

507
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,630
function full
uh

508
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
uh
 

509
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,389
uh
let's just call it g

510
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
let's just call it g
 

511
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,389
let's just call it g
uh maybe edges

512
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399

 

513
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:35,269

okay so this john said this is

514
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279

 

515
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,269

okay and then we do is what

516
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
okay and then we do is what
 

517
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,350
okay and then we do is what
for a b

518
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
for a b
 

519
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,750
for a b
in ts

520
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
in ts
 

521
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,790
in ts
a is a friend of b so we do this ts dot

522
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
a is a friend of b so we do this ts dot
 

523
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,150
a is a friend of b so we do this ts dot
or which function is it

524
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
or which function is it
 

525
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,949
or which function is it
come on

526
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959

 

527
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,829

right

528
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
right
 

529
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,150
right
so now we call this look

530
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
so now we call this look
 

531
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,389
so now we call this look
zero to one look look at me two and

532
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
zero to one look look at me two and
 

533
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,230
zero to one look look at me two and
three again come on turn around please

534
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
three again come on turn around please
 

535
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,269
three again come on turn around please
let's look

536
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
let's look
 

537
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,110
let's look
zero to one one two two three there are

538
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
zero to one one two two three there are
 

539
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,790
zero to one one two two three there are
two groups right but we want to find out

540
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
two groups right but we want to find out
 

541
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,389
two groups right but we want to find out
the group number and put it in the

542
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
the group number and put it in the
 

543
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,710
the group number and put it in the
counter right so look what

544
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
counter right so look what
 

545
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,389
counter right so look what
uh let's say g

546
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
uh let's say g
 

547
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,110
uh let's say g
equals counter

548
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
equals counter
 

549
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,269
equals counter
counter

550
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
counter
 

551
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,790
counter
uh

552
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
uh
 

553
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,710
uh
ps

554
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
ps
 

555
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,190
ps
uh group five group okay let's go find

556
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
uh group five group okay let's go find
 

557
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,470
uh group five group okay let's go find
group

558
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
group
 

559
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,750
group
five group

560
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
five group
 

561
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,630
five group
i

562
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
i
 

563
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,430
i
right

564
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
right
 

565
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,590
right
this is the final group for each one and

566
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
this is the final group for each one and
 

567
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,550
this is the final group for each one and
for

568
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
for
 

569
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,069
for
i

570
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079

 

571
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,710

in range and right in range m that's it

572
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720

 

573
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,310

okay so now i just need to check return

574
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
okay so now i just need to check return
 

575
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,069
okay so now i just need to check return
minimum

576
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
minimum
 

577
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,069
minimum
g dot values

578
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079

 

579
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,430

what d w

580
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
what d w
 

581
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,949
what d w
come on

582
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
come on
 

583
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,750
come on
g dot value is the number of

584
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
g dot value is the number of
 

585
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,190
g dot value is the number of
number of vertex that

586
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
number of vertex that
 

587
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,790
number of vertex that
that has have the same group so if it's

588
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
that has have the same group so if it's
 

589
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,230
that has have the same group so if it's
if it's uh

590
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
if it's uh
 

591
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,829
if it's uh
if we are saying if you're saying that

592
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
if we are saying if you're saying that
 

593
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,590
if we are saying if you're saying that
at least everybody has at least one

594
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
at least everybody has at least one
 

595
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,750
at least everybody has at least one
friend so what's this

596
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
friend so what's this
 

597
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,310
friend so what's this
the minimum the g dot value needs to be

598
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
the minimum the g dot value needs to be
 

599
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,269
the minimum the g dot value needs to be
what

600
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
what
 

601
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,030
what
at least two so it's bigger than one or

602
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
at least two so it's bigger than one or
 

603
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,710
at least two so it's bigger than one or
l is two bigger yeah

604
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
l is two bigger yeah
 

605
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,990
l is two bigger yeah
okay

606
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
okay
 

607
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,990
okay
yeah you see this is the way we're using

608
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
yeah you see this is the way we're using
 

609
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,710
yeah you see this is the way we're using
the

610
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
the
 

611
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,350
the
this joint set to solve this problem uh

612
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
this joint set to solve this problem uh
 

613
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,430
this joint set to solve this problem uh
but we can do it better right because

614
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
but we can do it better right because
 

615
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,230
but we can do it better right because
look

616
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
look
 

617
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,069
look
02 is the friend of one and so these two

618
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
02 is the friend of one and so these two
 

619
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,790
02 is the friend of one and so these two
cannot be the answer right uh cannot be

620
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
cannot be the answer right uh cannot be
 

621
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,030
cannot be the answer right uh cannot be
the the friend who doesn't have any

622
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
the the friend who doesn't have any
 

623
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,949
the the friend who doesn't have any
friend any friend right

624
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
friend any friend right
 

625
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,150
friend any friend right
okay

626
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
okay
 

627
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,030
okay
so what we can allocate a pulling array

628
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
so what we can allocate a pulling array
 

629
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,870
so what we can allocate a pulling array
a boolean pulling what's putting can you

630
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
a boolean pulling what's putting can you
 

631
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,990
a boolean pulling what's putting can you
tell

632
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
tell
 

633
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,829
tell
we talked about this before

634
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
we talked about this before
 

635
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,829
we talked about this before
it has two values put in

636
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839

 

637
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,630

t

638
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
t
 

639
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,790
t
and f once this

640
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
and f once this
 

641
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,310
and f once this
come on

642
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
come on
 

643
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,150
come on
what's this

644
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160

 

645
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,069

that's what it means binary true of yeah

646
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
that's what it means binary true of yeah
 

647
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,150
that's what it means binary true of yeah
it's the binary yes finally

648
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
it's the binary yes finally
 

649
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,550
it's the binary yes finally
so we have a boolean variable variable

650
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
so we have a boolean variable variable
 

651
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,870
so we have a boolean variable variable
and at the beginning they all initialize

652
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
and at the beginning they all initialize
 

653
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,230
and at the beginning they all initialize
to false

654
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
to false
 

655
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,629
to false
right and if you look 0 is a friend of

656
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
right and if you look 0 is a friend of
 

657
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,910
right and if you look 0 is a friend of
one so what do we do we set that zero to

658
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
one so what do we do we set that zero to
 

659
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,710
one so what do we do we set that zero to
two

660
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
two
 

661
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,710
two
we set a one to two

662
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
we set a one to two
 

663
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,389
we set a one to two
if two is fine or three what do we do

664
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
if two is fine or three what do we do
 

665
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,310
if two is fine or three what do we do
we say

666
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
we say
 

667
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,430
we say
the two and then the two yeah

668
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
the two and then the two yeah
 

669
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,829
the two and then the two yeah
we just need to check this array to see

670
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
we just need to check this array to see
 

671
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,590
we just need to check this array to see
if it has a

672
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
if it has a
 

673
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,269
if it has a
fourth right

674
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
fourth right
 

675
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,030
fourth right
okay yeah

676
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
okay yeah
 

677
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,700
okay yeah
okay let's do this

678
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:32,710
okay let's do this
 

679
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:44,550
okay let's do this
[Music]

680
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560

 

681
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,670

okay

682
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
okay
 

683
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,110
okay
okay so look so look uh let's say just

684
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
okay so look so look uh let's say just
 

685
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,829
okay so look so look uh let's say just
uh what do we call we call it theta okay

686
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:51,839
uh what do we call we call it theta okay
 

687
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,910
uh what do we call we call it theta okay
theta equals

688
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
theta equals
 

689
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,150
theta equals
force

690
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
force
 

691
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,430
force
force

692
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
force
 

693
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,750
force
times n what does it mean first times n

694
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
times n what does it mean first times n
 

695
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,269
times n what does it mean first times n
sorry

696
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
sorry
 

697
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,190
sorry
come on times multiply for the value

698
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
come on times multiply for the value
 

699
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,190
come on times multiply for the value
multiple n times what does it mean

700
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
multiple n times what does it mean
 

701
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,069
multiple n times what does it mean
there's a list

702
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
there's a list
 

703
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,110
there's a list
with all fours how many fours are there

704
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
with all fours how many fours are there
 

705
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,670
with all fours how many fours are there
and easy yeah look at look at one times

706
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
and easy yeah look at look at one times
 

707
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,150
and easy yeah look at look at one times
three what is what does it become

708
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
three what is what does it become
 

709
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,030
three what is what does it become
one one one right yeah

710
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
one one one right yeah
 

711
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,670
one one one right yeah
yeah easy yeah okay so and how about

712
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
yeah easy yeah okay so and how about
 

713
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,949
yeah easy yeah okay so and how about
this

714
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
this
 

715
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,389
this
a b c

716
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
a b c
 

717
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,670
a b c
times two what is it what do we get

718
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
times two what is it what do we get
 

719
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,990
times two what is it what do we get
a b c a b

720
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
a b c a b
 

721
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,990
a b c a b
a b c we're done yeah you see this

722
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
a b c we're done yeah you see this
 

723
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,069
a b c we're done yeah you see this
multiple is very powerful okay

724
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
multiple is very powerful okay
 

725
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,629
multiple is very powerful okay
uh so we have this force and then what

726
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
uh so we have this force and then what
 

727
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,310
uh so we have this force and then what
do we do for

728
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
do we do for
 

729
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,310
do we do for
a b in edges yeah

730
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
a b in edges yeah
 

731
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,150
a b in edges yeah
and then what should we do this a is

732
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
and then what should we do this a is
 

733
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,990
and then what should we do this a is
friend with b so what should we do theta

734
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
friend with b so what should we do theta
 

735
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,150
friend with b so what should we do theta
theta

736
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
theta
 

737
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,350
theta
dot theta one theta is array theta

738
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360

 

739
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,870

d tower

740
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
d tower
 

741
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,150
d tower
um

742
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
um
 

743
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,389
um
a is in front of b look a is the front

744
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
a is in front of b look a is the front
 

745
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,629
a is in front of b look a is the front
of b at the beginning f for sloth

746
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
of b at the beginning f for sloth
 

747
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,310
of b at the beginning f for sloth
remember we talked about

748
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
remember we talked about
 

749
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,389
remember we talked about
yeah a equals

750
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
yeah a equals
 

751
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,590
yeah a equals
two

752
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
two
 

753
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,110
two
two okay

754
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
two okay
 

755
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,470
two okay
theta

756
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
theta
 

757
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,269
theta
b equals one

758
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
b equals one
 

759
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,430
b equals one
okay so actually you can write we write

760
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
okay so actually you can write we write
 

761
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,350
okay so actually you can write we write
it into one line look you can write this

762
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
it into one line look you can write this
 

763
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,629
it into one line look you can write this
one theta a equals theta b

764
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
one theta a equals theta b
 

765
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,030
one theta a equals theta b
equals two right

766
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
equals two right
 

767
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,350
equals two right
okay so now we have a way with this way

768
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
okay so now we have a way with this way
 

769
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,110
okay so now we have a way with this way
okay so how can we how can we check

770
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
okay so how can we how can we check
 

771
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,389
okay so how can we how can we check
easily what

772
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
easily what
 

773
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,750
easily what
if there's a two values in in in here

774
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
if there's a two values in in in here
 

775
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,310
if there's a two values in in in here
how do we check if there's uh only one

776
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
how do we check if there's uh only one
 

777
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,910
how do we check if there's uh only one
kind of value here how do we check

778
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
kind of value here how do we check
 

779
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,990
kind of value here how do we check
um

780
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
um
 

781
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,470
um
so how do we check if there is uh

782
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
so how do we check if there is uh
 

783
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,509
so how do we check if there is uh
uh

784
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
uh
 

785
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,550
uh
okay so

786
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
okay so
 

787
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,629
okay so
how do we check if there's a two a laser

788
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
how do we check if there's a two a laser
 

789
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,629
how do we check if there's a two a laser
force in there

790
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
force in there
 

791
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,509
force in there
so look if if everybody is true right so

792
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
so look if if everybody is true right so
 

793
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,189
so look if if everybody is true right so
we want to check if there's a force here

794
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
we want to check if there's a force here
 

795
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,710
we want to check if there's a force here
so one way is that for i in

796
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720
so one way is that for i in
 

797
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,470
so one way is that for i in
theta

798
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
theta
 

799
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,350
theta
if

800
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
if
 

801
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,470
if
not i

802
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
not i
 

803
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,189
not i
if i right if not i

804
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
if i right if not i
 

805
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,629
if i right if not i
if not i return four right

806
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
if not i return four right
 

807
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,430
if not i return four right
return first otherwise would be ten two

808
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
return first otherwise would be ten two
 

809
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,509
return first otherwise would be ten two
yeah this is what easy way yeah you go

810
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
yeah this is what easy way yeah you go
 

811
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,350
yeah this is what easy way yeah you go
through each variables in your data and

812
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
through each variables in your data and
 

813
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,990
through each variables in your data and
check it with false if uh if it's false

814
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
check it with false if uh if it's false
 

815
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,990
check it with false if uh if it's false
if it's still false then we determine uh

816
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
if it's still false then we determine uh
 

817
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,670
if it's still false then we determine uh
return force right all right it's

818
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:23,680
return force right all right it's
 

819
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,710
return force right all right it's
written true right yeah we want to find

820
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
written true right yeah we want to find
 

821
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,310
written true right yeah we want to find
out that what's

822
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
out that what's
 

823
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,069
out that what's
new it means to

824
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
new it means to
 

825
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,030
new it means to
when it's true it means that all of our

826
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
when it's true it means that all of our
 

827
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,269
when it's true it means that all of our
values in data is true right so how

828
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
values in data is true right so how
 

829
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,590
values in data is true right so how
about we can do this here we can just

830
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
about we can do this here we can just
 

831
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,310
about we can do this here we can just
say

832
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
say
 

833
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,189
say
return

834
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,199
return
 

835
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,189
return
data look we can use this data.com

836
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:45,199
data look we can use this data.com

count force

838
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
count force
 

839
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,230
count force
we need to say count force equal equals

840
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
we need to say count force equal equals
 

841
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,350
we need to say count force equal equals
zero okay

842
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
zero okay
 

843
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,110
zero okay
so what does it mean you will go through

844
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
so what does it mean you will go through
 

845
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,749
so what does it mean you will go through
the data to check that to count how many

846
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
the data to check that to count how many
 

847
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,629
the data to check that to count how many
m how many values are equal to force

848
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
m how many values are equal to force
 

849
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,550
m how many values are equal to force
right and this value needs to be zero

850
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
right and this value needs to be zero
 

851
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,749
right and this value needs to be zero
right great what's the time complexity

852
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759

 

853
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,150

what's the space complexity what's the

854
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
what's the space complexity what's the
 

855
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,949
what's the space complexity what's the
space

856
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:08,959
space
 

857
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,749
space
ow what's a space commission

858
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759

 

859
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,550

come on are we using any space here

860
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
come on are we using any space here
 

861
00:16:16,560 --> 00:17:00,949
come on are we using any space here
how are you seeing any space here

862
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959

 

863
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,829

yeah because there should be

864
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
yeah because there should be
 

865
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,590
yeah because there should be
no condo which should be lowercase okay

866
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
no condo which should be lowercase okay
 

867
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,750
no condo which should be lowercase okay
it took one millisecond yeah the cost

868
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
it took one millisecond yeah the cost
 

869
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,990
it took one millisecond yeah the cost
would be lowercase okay because

870
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
would be lowercase okay because
 

871
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,750
would be lowercase okay because
the computer take one

872
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
the computer take one
 

873
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,270
the computer take one
millisecond because

874
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
millisecond because
 

875
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,949
millisecond because
it's really fast okay let's say for

876
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:14,959
it's really fast okay let's say for
 

877
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,710
it's really fast okay let's say for
today good job

878
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,720
today good job
 

879
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,069
today good job
good job say bye to people bye bye

880
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
good job say bye to people bye bye
 

881
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,079
