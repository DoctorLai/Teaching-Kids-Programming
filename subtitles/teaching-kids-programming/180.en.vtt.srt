hi hello mr harry mr ryan are you okay
yeah okay so today we will talk about

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
yeah okay so today we will talk about
 

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,669
yeah okay so today we will talk about
uh digital okay

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
uh digital okay
 

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,509
uh digital okay
all right so given the integer positive

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,519
all right so given the integer positive
 

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,070
all right so given the integer positive
integer

10
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
integer
 

11
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,790
integer
only contains the number one two or

12
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:18,800
only contains the number one two or
 

13
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,830
only contains the number one two or
three

14
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
three
 

15
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,990
three
like two three three you need to tell me

16
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
like two three three you need to tell me
 

17
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,950
like two three three you need to tell me
if you can

18
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
if you can
 

19
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,990
if you can
flip one digit and tell me the maximum

20
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
flip one digit and tell me the maximum
 

21
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,870
flip one digit and tell me the maximum
number you can get

22
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:26,880
number you can get
 

23
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,189
number you can get
so what's the maximum number you can get

24
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:29,199
so what's the maximum number you can get
 

25
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,029
so what's the maximum number you can get
by changing one digit to three

26
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
by changing one digit to three
 

27
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,069
by changing one digit to three
three three two three three

28
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
three three two three three
 

29
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,229
three three two three three
three three three okay how about three

30
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
three three three okay how about three
 

31
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,670
three three three okay how about three
two one three three one

32
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
two one three three one
 

33
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,670
two one three three one
how about three one two three three two

34
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
how about three one two three three two
 

35
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,709
how about three one two three three two
how about one uh

36
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
how about one uh
 

37
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,229
how about one uh
how about two one one

38
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
how about two one one
 

39
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,270
how about two one one
three one okay hold on

40
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
three one okay hold on
 

41
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,869
three one okay hold on
oh about three three three three okay so

42
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
oh about three three three three okay so
 

43
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,790
oh about three three three three okay so
yeah you got it so what's the strategy

44
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
yeah you got it so what's the strategy
 

45
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,510
yeah you got it so what's the strategy
what's the angle

46
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520

 

47
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,070

from this one and that's what the

48
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
from this one and that's what the
 

49
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,750
from this one and that's what the
biggest number

50
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
biggest number
 

51
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:19,670
biggest number
and if it's the uh

52
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680

 

53
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,390

so you base basically you check you

54
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
so you base basically you check you
 

55
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,190
so you base basically you check you
check

56
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
check
 

57
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,230
check
you replace the first

58
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
you replace the first
 

59
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,350
you replace the first
from left to right first number first

60
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
from left to right first number first
 

61
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,030
from left to right first number first
stitches that is not three and then

62
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
stitches that is not three and then
 

63
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,230
stitches that is not three and then
change it to three if

64
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
change it to three if
 

65
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,550
change it to three if
it's not if releasing any then you just

66
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
it's not if releasing any then you just
 

67
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,230
it's not if releasing any then you just
return it right

68
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
return it right
 

69
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,630
return it right
all right that's what you use okay so

70
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
all right that's what you use okay so
 

71
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,069
all right that's what you use okay so
that's the greedy yeah so

72
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
that's the greedy yeah so
 

73
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,109
that's the greedy yeah so
we start greedy strategy we start from

74
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
we start greedy strategy we start from
 

75
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,149
we start greedy strategy we start from
the left

76
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
the left
 

77
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,510
the left
we go through the right we check we stop

78
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
we go through the right we check we stop
 

79
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,550
we go through the right we check we stop
and the first digit that is not three

80
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
and the first digit that is not three
 

81
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,830
and the first digit that is not three
and then we change it to three all right

82
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
and then we change it to three all right
 

83
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,550
and then we change it to three all right
okay

84
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
okay
 

85
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,590
okay
you can already

86
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
you can already
 

87
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,830
you can already
enough you can that's your strategy

88
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
enough you can that's your strategy
 

89
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,830
enough you can that's your strategy
yeah i said enough

90
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
yeah i said enough
 

91
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,589
yeah i said enough
okay

92
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
okay
 

93
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,710
okay
and what's the missing here column

94
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
and what's the missing here column
 

95
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,750
and what's the missing here column
okay now n is a number yeah n is a

96
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
okay now n is a number yeah n is a
 

97
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,070
okay now n is a number yeah n is a
number we want to convert it to

98
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
number we want to convert it to
 

99
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,390
number we want to convert it to
an array of digits yeah how how can we

100
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
an array of digits yeah how how can we
 

101
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,110
an array of digits yeah how how can we
do it all we can

102
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
do it all we can
 

103
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,869
do it all we can
i mean there are few ways we can do it

104
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
i mean there are few ways we can do it
 

105
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,430
i mean there are few ways we can do it
but what i'm saying is look if it's one

number okay
it's different type okay okay

132
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
it's different type okay okay
 

133
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,110
it's different type okay okay
yeah and i'm having it now

134

137
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,309
you're not listening i am okay and then
now if i want to convert it

138
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
now if i want to convert it
 

139
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,830
now if i want to convert it
to to leave a list of

140
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
to to leave a list of
 

141
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,869
to to leave a list of
digits how can we do this all right

142
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
digits how can we do this all right
 

143
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,550
digits how can we do this all right
if you want to convert it to list three

144
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
if you want to convert it to list three
 

145
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,990
if you want to convert it to list three
three no i mean here this is a string

146
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
three no i mean here this is a string
 

147
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,350
three no i mean here this is a string
yeah this is a string type

148
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
yeah this is a string type
 

149
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,710
yeah this is a string type
and then i want to convert it to a list

150
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
and then i want to convert it to a list
 

151
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,949
and then i want to convert it to a list
a list of a list of digits

152
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959

 

153
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,149

yeah a list and then look converted here

154
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
yeah a list and then look converted here
 

155
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,670
yeah a list and then look converted here
sprn okay okay and now we have a list

156
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
sprn okay okay and now we have a list
 

157
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,670
sprn okay okay and now we have a list
then it's easier we go through the list

158
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
then it's easier we go through the list
 

159
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,670
then it's easier we go through the list
from left to right and stop

160
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
from left to right and stop
 

161
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,390
from left to right and stop
if it's not three and we change it right

162
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
if it's not three and we change it right
 

163
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,589
if it's not three and we change it right
right

164
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
right
 

165
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,869
right
okay so look that was my way ar

166
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
okay so look that was my way ar
 

167
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,869
okay so look that was my way ar
equals list what what should i put here

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,469
into a string you use the join
this is the delimiter okay and if you

yeah join is this way
i'm talking about this way what's the

312
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
i'm talking about this way what's the
 

313
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,469
i'm talking about this way what's the
opportunity

314
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
opportunity
 

315
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,309

okay it's a
little bit different than at least okay

338
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
little bit different than at least okay
 

339
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,230
little bit different than at least okay
what do you do release

340
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
what do you do release
 

341
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,310
what do you do release
what happened eric when you do the list

342
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
what happened eric when you do the list
 

343
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,310
what happened eric when you do the list
what happened when you do a list of

344
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
what happened when you do a list of
 

345
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,070
what happened when you do a list of
these

346
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
these
 

347
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,150
these
what is that what what happened

348
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160

 

349
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,590

this you have how many elements of list

350
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
this you have how many elements of list
 

351
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,310
this you have how many elements of list
abc space how many three

352
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320

 

353
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,150

one two three three i mean look at that

354
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
one two three three i mean look at that
 

355
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,150
one two three three i mean look at that
space when you convert when you do the

356
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
space when you convert when you do the
 

357
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,710
space when you convert when you do the
list

358
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
list
 

359
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,949
list
you will have every letter every

360
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
you will have every letter every
 

361
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,710
you will have every letter every
character so there will be five

362
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
character so there will be five
 

363
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,590
character so there will be five
right yeah yeah but when you do the

364
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
right yeah yeah but when you do the
 

365
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,150
right yeah yeah but when you do the
split

366
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
split
 

367
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,949
split
the space now you only have three abc

368
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
the space now you only have three abc
 

369
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,430
the space now you only have three abc
got it that's the difference

370
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
got it that's the difference
 

371
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,470
got it that's the difference
does it make sense i said three no

372
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
does it make sense i said three no
 

373
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,509
does it make sense i said three no
three you say three is least is no

374
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
three you say three is least is no
 

375
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,710
three you say three is least is no
wrong split is three this is five okay

376
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
wrong split is three this is five okay
 

377
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,190
wrong split is three this is five okay
but do you know the difference major

378
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
but do you know the difference major
 

379
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,670
but do you know the difference major
difference

380
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680

 

381
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,870

does it make sense what's the time

382
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
does it make sense what's the time
 

383
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,230
does it make sense what's the time
complexity

384
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240

 

385
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,030

n is the number of the digits in the in

386
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
n is the number of the digits in the in
 

387
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,509
n is the number of the digits in the in
the

388
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
the
 

389
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,550
the
string okay what's the space complexity

390
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560

 

391
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:15,670

n no one one

392
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680

 

393
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,750

you need to be confident okay it doesn't

394
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
you need to be confident okay it doesn't
 

395
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:43,990
you need to be confident okay it doesn't
make sense

396
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000

 

397
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,670

you forgot this yeah yeah a space

398
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
you forgot this yeah yeah a space
 

399
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,790
you forgot this yeah yeah a space
empty the dream dot john john

400
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800

 

401
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,710

okay look at there's a bracket open

402
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
okay look at there's a bracket open
 

403
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,470
okay look at there's a bracket open
bracket open like a clothesline and you

404
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
bracket open like a clothesline and you
 

405
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,110
bracket open like a clothesline and you
need another one okay i'll do it

406
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
need another one okay i'll do it
 

407
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,000
need another one okay i'll do it
okay okay
