00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,909

go hello hello mr area are you right

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:03,919
go hello hello mr area are you right
 

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,430
go hello hello mr area are you right
yes okay so i today uh we were given a

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
yes okay so i today uh we were given a
 

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,629
yes okay so i today uh we were given a
list of string

6
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
list of string
 

7
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,830
list of string
like abc a list of strings string away a

8
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:11,840
like abc a list of strings string away a
 

9
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,709
like abc a list of strings string away a
b

10
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
b
 

11
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,230
b
and then maybe a a b c

12
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
and then maybe a a b c
 

13
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,910
and then maybe a a b c
and b c okay that's it so if i tell you

14
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
and b c okay that's it so if i tell you
 

15
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,390
and b c okay that's it so if i tell you
that

16
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
that
 

17
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,910
that
you you can for each each um so this is

18
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
you you can for each each um so this is
 

19
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,310
you you can for each each um so this is
the

20
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
the
 

21
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,070
the
list of string with three uh three

22
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
list of string with three uh three
 

23
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,390
list of string with three uh three
strings and you are allowed to

24
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
strings and you are allowed to
 

25
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,509
strings and you are allowed to
move the letters we arrange the vectors

26
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
move the letters we arrange the vectors
 

27
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,709
move the letters we arrange the vectors
so we re rearrange the characters

28
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
so we re rearrange the characters
 

29
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,670
so we re rearrange the characters
yeah so basically you can put it a b c

30
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
yeah so basically you can put it a b c
 

31
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,709
yeah so basically you can put it a b c
you know you can just

32
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
you know you can just
 

33
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,990
you know you can just
you know arrange it move it to different

34
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
you know arrange it move it to different
 

35
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,630
you know arrange it move it to different
um

36
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
um
 

37
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,110
um
strings yeah yeah yeah any letter i need

38
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
strings yeah yeah yeah any letter i need
 

39
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,110
strings yeah yeah yeah any letter i need
to show any string any position and

40
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
to show any string any position and
 

41
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,709
to show any string any position and
can you make all the strings equal yeah

42
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
can you make all the strings equal yeah
 

43
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,189
can you make all the strings equal yeah
okay this is quite obvious so how do you

44
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
okay this is quite obvious so how do you
 

45
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:53,990
okay this is quite obvious so how do you
move like

46
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
move like
 

47
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,389
move like
you move them second string oh

48
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
you move them second string oh
 

49
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,869
you move them second string oh
one of the a doesn't matter from

50
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
one of the a doesn't matter from
 

51
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:01,830
one of the a doesn't matter from
beginning yeah

52
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
beginning yeah
 

53
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,830
beginning yeah
so that will become abc okay so another

54
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
so that will become abc okay so another
 

55
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,830
so that will become abc okay so another
example okay

56
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840

 

57
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:24,830

um

58
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840

 

59
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:36,230

complicated

60
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240

 

61
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,710

for this one can you make a can you make

62
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
for this one can you make a can you make
 

63
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,670
for this one can you make a can you make
it the same

64
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
it the same
 

65
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,389
it the same
by rearranging the right method yeah

66
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399

 

67
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,440

i need position so yeah can you do it

68
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,450
i need position so yeah can you do it
 

69
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,030
i need position so yeah can you do it
[Music]

70
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
[Music]
 

71
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,149
[Music]
why ah this one yeah

72
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
why ah this one yeah
 

73
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,350
why ah this one yeah
it's so easy yeah look at eight look but

74
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
it's so easy yeah look at eight look but
 

75
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,670
it's so easy yeah look at eight look but
this

76
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
this
 

77
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,630
this
is abc abc but this is acd but that's

78
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
is abc abc but this is acd but that's
 

79
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,069
is abc abc but this is acd but that's
okay you can just move here

80
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
okay you can just move here
 

81
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,550
okay you can just move here
move to any you can still yeah so

82
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
move to any you can still yeah so
 

83
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,830
move to any you can still yeah so
because you can move the

84
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
because you can move the
 

85
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,469
because you can move the
characters around to any strings any

86
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
characters around to any strings any
 

87
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,910
characters around to any strings any
partitions

88
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
partitions
 

89
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,470
partitions
okay so given a list of strings how can

90
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
okay so given a list of strings how can
 

91
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,589
okay so given a list of strings how can
we make sure

92
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
we make sure
 

93
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,510
we make sure
how you check can we do it so what's

94
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
how you check can we do it so what's
 

95
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,630
how you check can we do it so what's
your idea i mean

96
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
your idea i mean
 

97
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:34,390
your idea i mean
say firstly yeah

98
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400

 

99
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,740

okay so

100
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:36,750
okay so
 

101
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,550
okay so
[Music]

102
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560

 

103
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,710

the characters and see if we could

104
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
the characters and see if we could
 

105
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,589
the characters and see if we could
divide it by

106
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
divide it by
 

107
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,070
divide it by
n because so in python we want to count

108
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
n because so in python we want to count
 

109
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,030
n because so in python we want to count
the number of frequencies for a string

110
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
the number of frequencies for a string
 

111
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,430
the number of frequencies for a string
right

112
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
right
 

113
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,270
right
so what kind of data structure are we

114
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
so what kind of data structure are we
 

115
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,949
so what kind of data structure are we
using what how can we count

116
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
using what how can we count
 

117
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,790
using what how can we count
remember that how can we count

118
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
remember that how can we count
 

119
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,470
remember that how can we count
um how can we talk for example

120
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
um how can we talk for example
 

121
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,070
um how can we talk for example
yeah we have encounter so look the cow

122
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
yeah we have encounter so look the cow
 

123
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,430
yeah we have encounter so look the cow
counter so cow counter

124
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
counter so cow counter
 

125
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,030
counter so cow counter
counter what you call this string this

126
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
counter what you call this string this
 

127
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,830
counter what you call this string this
string is in

128
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
string is in
 

129
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,830
string is in
all the string combined yeah

130
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840

 

131
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,030

how can we make all the strings together

132
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
how can we make all the strings together
 

133
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,270
how can we make all the strings together
concatenate all the strings in the least

134
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
concatenate all the strings in the least
 

135
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,309
concatenate all the strings in the least
academic

136
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
academic
 

137
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,990
academic
together we use what join

138
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
together we use what join
 

139
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,030
together we use what join
so we join with empty string so

140
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
so we join with empty string so
 

141
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,110
so we join with empty string so
m join john a-r-r right

142
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
m join john a-r-r right
 

143
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,830
m join john a-r-r right
now s will be the key keys will be the

144
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
now s will be the key keys will be the
 

145
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,470
now s will be the key keys will be the
character

146
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
character
 

147
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,789
character
the value will be what now what's what's

148
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
the value will be what now what's what's
 

149
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,030
the value will be what now what's what's
s what's what's in s s is a key value

150
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
s what's what's in s s is a key value
 

151
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,750
s what's what's in s s is a key value
pair right

152
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
pair right
 

153
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,190
pair right
key value pair so what are the keys

154
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200

 

155
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,509

keys are the character right the unique

156
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
keys are the character right the unique
 

157
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,630
keys are the character right the unique
characters yeah

158
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
characters yeah
 

159
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,070
characters yeah
yeah the values will be what the

160
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
yeah the values will be what the
 

161
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,869
yeah the values will be what the
number of them the number of times they

162
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
number of them the number of times they
 

163
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,630
number of them the number of times they
appear in all the strings yeah

164
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
appear in all the strings yeah
 

165
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,910
appear in all the strings yeah
yeah okay so the numbers and then what

166
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
yeah okay so the numbers and then what
 

167
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,670
yeah okay so the numbers and then what
should we do now we just need to go

168
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
should we do now we just need to go
 

169
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,070
should we do now we just need to go
through

170
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
through
 

171
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,870
through
each value to see if what

172
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
each value to see if what
 

173
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,590
each value to see if what
if what

174
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600

 

175
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,629

can be divided by n right so how can we

176
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
can be divided by n right so how can we
 

177
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,189
can be divided by n right so how can we
check that

178
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199

 

179
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,150

which which which operator good number

180
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
which which which operator good number
 

181
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,469
which which which operator good number
is

182
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
is
 

183
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,310
is
modulus so this modulus n equal equal

184
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
modulus so this modulus n equal equal
 

185
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,070
modulus so this modulus n equal equal
one

186
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
one
 

187
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,390
one
zero yeah we're done okay so let's try

188
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
zero yeah we're done okay so let's try
 

189
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,749
zero yeah we're done okay so let's try
this

190
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759

 

191
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,270

and think about the time and space

192
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
and think about the time and space
 

193
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,830
and think about the time and space
complexity okay i'm gonna ask you

194
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
complexity okay i'm gonna ask you
 

195
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,830
complexity okay i'm gonna ask you
in one minute if i check

196
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
in one minute if i check
 

197
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,629
in one minute if i check
array uh uh let's say

198
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
array uh uh let's say
 

199
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,469
array uh uh let's say
what uh s okay

200
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
what uh s okay
 

201
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,029
what uh s okay
i say another way okay now we what do we

202
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
i say another way okay now we what do we
 

203
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,550
i say another way okay now we what do we
do

204
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
do
 

205
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,070
do
n will be length of s and

206
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
n will be length of s and
 

207
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,670
n will be length of s and
uh actually

208
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
uh actually
 

209
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,430
uh actually
let's say ar array a real risk

210
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
let's say ar array a real risk
 

211
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,150
let's say ar array a real risk
and then s will be equals joined

212
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
and then s will be equals joined
 

213
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,909
and then s will be equals joined
john ar right so s is the string of

214
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
john ar right so s is the string of
 

215
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,510
john ar right so s is the string of
all together all the letters all the

216
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
all together all the letters all the
 

217
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,270
all together all the letters all the
strings in all the lists

218
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
strings in all the lists
 

219
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,710
strings in all the lists
and then c will be the counter

220
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
and then c will be the counter
 

221
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,430
and then c will be the counter
counter s right so c will be the key

222
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
counter s right so c will be the key
 

223
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,230
counter s right so c will be the key
value pairs

224
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
value pairs
 

225
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,350
value pairs
keys the need characters that the values

226
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
keys the need characters that the values
 

227
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,590
keys the need characters that the values
will be the number of times they appear

228
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
will be the number of times they appear
 

229
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,790
will be the number of times they appear
in all of these

230
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
in all of these
 

231
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,189
in all of these
on all the strings and then what should

232
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
on all the strings and then what should
 

233
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,150
on all the strings and then what should
we do now

234
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
we do now
 

235
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,070
we do now
so we can go through for i in

236
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
so we can go through for i in
 

237
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,350
so we can go through for i in
c dot values right yeah we're going to

238
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
c dot values right yeah we're going to
 

239
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,390
c dot values right yeah we're going to
go into the value if

240
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
go into the value if
 

241
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,230
go into the value if
i modifiers what

242
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
i modifiers what
 

243
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,029
i modifiers what
i models which one is value and n

244
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:04,039
i models which one is value and n
 

245
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:19,590
i models which one is value and n
is

246
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600

 

247
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,189

o join o n counter o

248
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
o join o n counter o
 

249
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,309
o join o n counter o
n values of o and o n okay

250
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
n values of o and o n okay
 

251
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,550
n values of o and o n okay
what's the space complexity

252
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560

 

253
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,909

are we using this space here one

254
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
are we using this space here one
 

255
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,350
are we using this space here one
here n is the number of the

256
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
here n is the number of the
 

257
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,309
here n is the number of the
characters in all the strings combined

258
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
characters in all the strings combined
 

259
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,590
characters in all the strings combined
okay

260
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
okay
 

261
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,749
okay
yeah the number of characters in all the

262
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
yeah the number of characters in all the
 

263
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,070
yeah the number of characters in all the
strings combined okay

264
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
strings combined okay
 

265
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,550
strings combined okay
so we can do do this make this shorter

266
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
so we can do do this make this shorter
 

267
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,150
so we can do do this make this shorter
okay so we can do this

268
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
okay so we can do this
 

269
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,749
okay so we can do this
yeah we can just return

270
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759

 

271
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,189

o right or what

272
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
o right or what
 

273
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,629
o right or what
uh let's say x

274
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
uh let's say x
 

275
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,749
uh let's say x
modulus and equal equal zero

276
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
modulus and equal equal zero
 

277
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,189
modulus and equal equal zero
for x yeah yeah for x

278
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
for x yeah yeah for x
 

279
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,110
for x yeah yeah for x
x in c dot i mean what is x

280
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
x in c dot i mean what is x
 

281
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,469
x in c dot i mean what is x
value here x

282
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
value here x
 

283
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,350
value here x
for here i define x here for x in c the

284
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
for here i define x here for x in c the
 

285
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,309
for here i define x here for x in c the
value

286
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
value
 

287
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,350
value
o means every every x in

288
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
o means every every x in
 

289
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,830
o means every every x in
c dot value it needs to be multiplied by

290
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
c dot value it needs to be multiplied by
 

291
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,830
c dot value it needs to be multiplied by
n equal equal to zero okay

292
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
n equal equal to zero okay
 

293
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,469
n equal equal to zero okay
right these four lines can be replaced

294
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
right these four lines can be replaced
 

295
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,909
right these four lines can be replaced
by this one

296
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
by this one
 

297
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,670
by this one
and then see the counter s you can look

298
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
and then see the counter s you can look
 

299
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,589
and then see the counter s you can look
you can move these into one line right

300
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
you can move these into one line right
 

301
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,950
you can move these into one line right
right so c can move here

302
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
right so c can move here
 

303
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,790
right so c can move here
right so you say one and and look

304
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
right so you say one and and look
 

305
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,629
right so you say one and and look
and and will move here okay

306
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
and and will move here okay
 

307
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,869
and and will move here okay
so what does it mean a one nine or x

308
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
so what does it mean a one nine or x
 

309
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,629
so what does it mean a one nine or x
modulus length a r

310
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
modulus length a r
 

311
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,390
modulus length a r
equal to zero for x in counter

312
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400

 

313
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,029

string dot john a r right the values all

314
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
string dot john a r right the values all
 

315
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:03,430
string dot john a r right the values all
right

316
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
right
 

317
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,830
right
so you just need one none okay got it

318
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
so you just need one none okay got it
 

319
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,510
so you just need one none okay got it
can you write that whole thing

320
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
can you write that whole thing
 

321
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,629
can you write that whole thing
so it's not confusing that we need to um

322
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
so it's not confusing that we need to um
 

323
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,029
so it's not confusing that we need to um
read in different places yeah yeah i

324
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
read in different places yeah yeah i
 

325
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:13,670
read in different places yeah yeah i
think i

326
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
think i
 

327
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,110
think i
particularly think this is better

328
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
particularly think this is better
 

329
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,270
particularly think this is better
because it's more clear right if you

330
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
because it's more clear right if you
 

331
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,869
because it's more clear right if you
squeeze everything into one eye you'll

332
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
squeeze everything into one eye you'll
 

333
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,629
squeeze everything into one eye you'll
be harder to understand right but some

334
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
be harder to understand right but some
 

335
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,150
be harder to understand right but some
people fancy this one

336
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
people fancy this one
 

337
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,749
people fancy this one
so in person you can do this one liner

338
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
