1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,560
hello mr mr ryan are you right yeah

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,599
what have we learned last lessons sql

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,599
what's sql structured

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,440
structure query language so basically

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,160
it's a programming language it's a

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,880
language that we use to interact with

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,840
database right database organized data

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,320
remember

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,560
in relational database

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,320
we use the tables right tables the

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,560
columns the rows

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,359
the columns these are metadata

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,360
attributes right look hit point attack

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,200
defense special attack special different

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,559
speed gender and each row pokemon right

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
and we talk about the select the

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,079
basically the select is to retrieve the

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,680
data we want to filter out some data and

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,399
retrieve the data from the database this

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,200
pokemon table could contain a minions i

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,199
know we're only interested in a few so

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,559
we we can use the synthetic

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,960
so that's something from pokemon a place

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,760
where the conditions yeah we use the

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,280
square statement to figure out the data

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,000
we want right for example we are

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,040
interested in the top five

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,240
pokemons which have the largest

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,560
hit point okay so we can do this select

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,119
name hit point from pokemon

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,240
where you know we can skip this

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,000
order by hit point but it returns all

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,759
the programmers sorted by hitpoint we

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
only interested in the top five for

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,360
example then we can use the keyword top

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,759
see that top five or some sql version is

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,640
supposed to limit like mysql

38
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,960
order by limit five it means that we're

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,479
only returning five okay

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,280
slap top

41
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,600
or

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840
limit limit five

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,040
so we use the select to retrieve the

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,439
data what kind of possible operations do

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,439
we need to talk to you know to deal with

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,799
this table plus

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,759
plus what's plus minus yeah plus or

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,640
minus

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,560
okay yeah plus is insert

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,520
minus is what

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,920
we want to put the new data in it we

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,959
call it insert we want to remove the

53
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,239
data in it we call it the div okay so

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,640
insert and delete

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,160
one is missing insert delete and what's

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,480
the other one

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,480
you could possibly think of wait update

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,400
where then update yeah you just want to

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,200
update this value for example to 100

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
right

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,959
so these three

62
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
together is the select okay

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,599
are the four

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,480
most popular sql statement a database

65
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,560
could have many tables right pokemon's a

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,720
table fight

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,040
pokemon fight each other right we stole

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,840
those outcomes in a separate kisses

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,360
so we could have some table like this

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,800
pokemon fight

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,360
pokemon fight

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,879
we have a name of a pokemon one

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,920
name of the pokemon two and five results

74
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,720
okay

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,080
and maybe a date time so when they fight

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,680
before we talk about those four

77
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,640
statements we can use the create

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,720
database to create empty database so

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,640
insert insert keyword okay let's talk

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,840
about insert keyword so we can say

81
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,680
insert

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,800
into pokemon

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,599
right

84
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,080
the column and release the columns and

85
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,080
then values the syntax for user is

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
insert

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,560
into

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,560
table okay pokemon

89
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,560
and

90
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,480
we're going to have this hp

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,599
a essentially and then values

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,040
values hp will be a hundred a would be

93
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,040
something 90

94
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,959
okay and that would insert a new record

95
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,680
at the end another thing that would be

96
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:48,560
insert into set

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,599
hp equals 100 comma a equals 90

98
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,959
okay

99
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,920
did it

100
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,680
it's quite similar to a select

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,319
delete from

102
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,599
pokemon if we just say different

103
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,480
programmer and everything will be

104
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,959
removed

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,959
but we can add a where

106
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,599
where hp equals 91 then first of all it

107
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,159
will locate this 91 and you just remove

108
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,519
it from database delete from something

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,120
where condition

110
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,560
it's english

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,959
insert into

112
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,440
set the new record hp equals 100 a

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,840
equals 90. so it means the numerator

114
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,759
has the hp equals 100 a equal 90 and

115
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,320
blah blah blah okay or insert into

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,600
pokemon and you specify the columns and

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,000
values that's another syntax and update

118
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,800
can you imagine that what's update

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,840
so update tokens

120
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,280
right

121
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,199
set

122
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,800
i want i want to change this i want to

123
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,280
change this so

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,960
update performance set

125
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,520
a equals

126
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,800
for example 90

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,040
where

128
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,639
where okay if i don't specify where what

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,280
happened

130
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,160
this column will be changed

131
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:04,960
to all 90 right i don't want to do that

132
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,479
so update pokemon set a equals 90

133
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,560
where

134
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,759
name equals viral

135
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,880
from right now whatever okay so look at

136
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,360
this name

137
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,320
this name is a primary key primary key

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,360
in database is a special column which

139
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,160
unique

140
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,160
identifies a record record the name is

141
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,320
the primary key each table has a primary

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,800
key it's recommended to have a primary

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,840
key for each table like a primary key is

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,800
a special column in a table that

145
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,120
uniquely identifies a record right for

146
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,039
example like there's only one

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,840
pokemon called the villa plum right

148
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,800
okay vile vial

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,120
clean wire from okay you can put another

150
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,360
document called the via premiere because

151
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,600
this is the primary key

152
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,240
if we insert into pokemon

153
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,639
and then we set set name equals

154
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
via prompt database where we call error

155
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,479
say okay we already have a via prompt

156
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,919
here you can't

157
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,600
tell me to add another record okay

158
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,759
so let's update

159
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,919
okay if we want to remove everything we

160
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,440
can use the db from right we just say oh

161
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,639
we can use another keyword called

162
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,639
truncate let's truncate

163
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,680
truncate pokemon and then that means

164
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,440
that we remove everything but keep the

165
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,600
table structure we keep the table

166
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,479
structure we remove the content truncate

167
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,720
the token is the same as td from pokemon

168
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,560
what have we talked about today select

169
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,120
select top select limit select top

170
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,440
but we're returning the top five or top

171
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,720
we can select top 50 percent something

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,520
like that or we can see let limit 10

173
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,319
returning only the first 10 uh

174
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,680
performance okay insert

175
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,960
delete update another syntax insert into

176
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,120
pokemon inside into document select

177
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,960
from another table so we are selecting

178
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,520
something from another source another

179
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,360
table and then we try to import it uh to

180
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,479
try to insert it in here for example

181
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,960
like we have a

182
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,759
pokemon one is this one right

183
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,160
and then we have another pokemon too

184
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,720
we want to copy all everything here to

185
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,039
pokemon 2 so we can say

186
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,880
insert into pokemon too

187
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,680
right

188
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,759
these columns i select this column from

189
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,840
pokemon right they get it so so

190
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,000
basically we are trying to copy all the

191
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,240
records from the source from see that

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,280
source into another also we have a talk

193
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,960
about create database job database job

194
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,080
so we want to drop everything in a

195
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,080
database

196
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,479
a database contains many tables for

197
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,199
example like pokemon's contains uh two

198
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,680
tables program one pokemon two

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,440
now we want to drop database programming

200
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,240
and then pokemon one and pokemon 2 will

201
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,360
be

202
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,440
removed

203
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,240
everything will be removed okay so sum

204
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,280
up

205
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,879
how many keywords create database

206
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,400
job database

207
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,520
truncate table truncate truncate pokemon

208
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,800
it select something from somewhere where

209
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,440
condition

210
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
limit or select top

211
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,680
insert

212
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,720
into table columns and values inside the

213
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,800
tables column equals value 1 column 2

214
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,840
equals value 2.

215
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,960
okay

216
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,000
insert

217
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,479
into and then select did delete

218
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,479
delete from tables data from tables

219
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,560
where to remove the records from the

220
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,640
database update

221
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,080
update tables

222
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,880
set column a equals something where

223
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,200
condition we want to change specifically

224
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,839
a value or two values multiple columns

225
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,920
one question we want to update

226
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,000
all the attacks

227
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,519
we want to increment all the attacks by

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,480
10 we want to increase this column by 10

229
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,000
every value increased by 10. update

230
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,360
pokemons

231
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,240
set

232
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,720
a

233
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,480
equals a plus 10

234
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,519
right and that will increase everything

235
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,279
here or we can say we want to increase

236
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,200
the attack by 10 if it's lower than 100

237
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,760
right if it's lower than 100 so how do

238
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,760
we marry

239
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,360
update

240
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,880
pokemon that table

241
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,399
set

242
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,800
a equals a plus 10 where

243
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,279
a is smaller than 100 what's happening

244
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,279
after this

245
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
so we choose two columns which is three

246
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,640
columns

247
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,040
so here this three yeah

248
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,839
so this will be changed to 85 this will

249
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,320
change it to 90 this change to

250
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,560
92 okay that's what it is what have you

251
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,560
learned today

252
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,120
okay so what operations can we do with

253
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,959
the sql what are the keywords you

254
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,160
learned today update

255
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,080
update and delete delete

256
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,120
insert

257
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,120
select select

258
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,519
shirt from closet where clean equals one

259
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,160
and color you construct

260
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,959
yeah select something from somewhere

261
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,360
where conditions claim equals one means

262
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,920
it's green grain equals zero not cream

263
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,000
dirty and color equals black so we

264
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,720
probably have to give a black this is

265
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,560
the constant string yeah okay that's it

266
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,560
for today bye-bye

267
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,560
bye-bye
