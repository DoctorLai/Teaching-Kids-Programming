1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,960
so we are given a sentence a string

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,179
right uh separated by a white space so

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,519
we have a list of words right and we

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,960
want to find out if this is the circular

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,760
sentence no sentence

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,439
they don't have a full stop good

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,600
question okay how about we ignore that

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,840
okay

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,660
you can't say this this suit was this

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,840
okay okay dirty circular what's the

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,620
circular it's not cool what is the verb

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,960
a circle and so in this case and and

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,239
dirty is adjective you don't actually

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,840
need the adjective well you need a

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,360
subject and a verb subject and an object

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,879
okay this is not a English method okay

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,879
coming back to this okay what's uh

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,219
so look so the last letter of the first

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,039
word equals the

20
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,600
first letter of next word and then the

21
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,600
last letter of the last word

22
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:14,240
so let's just assume it's all lowercase

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:17,340
so for example another one a b b c c d e

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,780
f a this is the circular right because

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,439
look

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,600
this is the same this is the same uh

27
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,299
this is not okay this is the same all

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,119
right and then the last one right at

29
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,939
least it's not right hello

30
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,400
what this is not

31
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,720
okay and how about the finger word

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,900
sentence how about hello is it a is it a

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:47,700
circular sentence no no this is it it's

34
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:50,399
only one word yeah but h e l h this is a

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,600
circular but what's that word no I just

36
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,600
made it okay

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,880
what's a solution here

38
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,439
um we

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,220
um what's the solution what kind of

40
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,220
problem is this

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,120
because you may work here but we don't

42
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,739
need it right look we just go through

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,940
the water we just check all right

44
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,459
basically we just

45
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,780
yeah yeah we just checked right this is

46
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:24,000
simulation right it's least

47
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,300
next at the beginning of the next one I

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,480
will stop and we turn fast if we found

49
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,640
this match right do it split okay so the

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,000
first thing to this is a string to

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,599
together words we need to split right

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,599
Define if this is checked okay check

53
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,819
circulars okay check circular s array

54
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,319
first of all array equals s dot split

55
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,319
right

56
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,019
by the meter but if we don't give it a

57
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,660
delimiter it will split our y space okay

58
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:57,620
we can give a delimiter right here right

59
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,620
if

60
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,980
listen through okay let's make it true

61
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,959
right because the empty empty thing is

62
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:14,700
the circulation that's that's just that

63
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:16,319
assume that okay okay so now uh n equal

64
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,360
at least is the length of the walls

65
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,840
right because it was

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,840
four I for I in range

67
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,379
two and

68
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:34,080
right if

69
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:37,200
a r r i the one the current word last

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,420
letter right minus one right if it is

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,599
not equal the next block what's the next

72
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,599
one

73
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,400
return four

74
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,780
okay that's a slight problem here can

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,180
you tell me and otherwise if we're

76
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:02,280
passing all the Checkmate entry right

77
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:06,019
that's the problem because the a a b

78
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:10,260
C okay so for example last three words

79
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:12,120
index from I here to this one well I

80
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,640
plus one right this is the next one I

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,579
plus one there's nothing here so we want

82
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,639
to rewind it to to the beginning right

83
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,440
look when I is here

84
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,380
I plus one

85
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,600
what's I plus one yeah I the last law

86
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,419
was I plus one you should go back to the

87
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,060
first first of all right

88
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:36,840
otherwise array I plus one that would be

89
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:40,800
out of index the index ARR is only valid

90
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,960
from zero to n minus one right but but

91
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,360
you're telling me eight I plus one this

92
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,100
is out of index it should be pointing

93
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,040
back to the first row right so how do we

94
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,900
fix this sorry does it have to do that

95
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,380
yeah the last one we have to check the

96
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,780
password if it matches if

97
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,060
so how do we do this how do we wind it

98
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,300
remember we need to use if

99
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,000
we can do it but we can do better

100
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,699
um all right we can do you know this

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,040
remember we how do we calculate what's

102
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,860
this

103
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:16,199
modules yes and modulus and it becomes

104
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,860
zero right all right so we just have to

105
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,419
model us here modules and like and then

106
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,300
you make it back to the first one

107
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:26,660
another way is how do we fix it another

108
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,660
way

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,020
how about I push a here

110
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,740
okay and then we just keep looping the

111
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:40,979
index at the beginning I put that extra

112
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,160
I copy the extra the first element

113
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:46,979
back to the other way right am I

114
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,440
make sense okay so these three lines

115
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:53,759
like look what's this kind of pattern

116
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,160
okay we are checking the violation here

117
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,680
right if we find a mismatch we do 10

118
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,720
fast am I right yeah

119
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,080
does it make sense if we don't find any

120
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,680
violation we return true make sense we

121
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,800
can use the all keyword right return or

122
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,840
or

123
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,120
means everything here needs to be need

124
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,620
to be there two need to be true any

125
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,479
what's the difference between all and

126
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,360
any kinectomy

127
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,600
any of them but all

128
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,539
so anyway

129
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,520
it can be at least one and all it has to

130
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,900
be everything that's right yes so return

131
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,300
or

132
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:38,880
this thing and all this thing here four

133
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,360
comes here right right so we can say

134
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,240
return or ar I minus one this is the

135
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,840
last letter of the world but we have to

136
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,680
neglect oh this is the opposite it needs

137
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,360
to be

138
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:57,660
equal or everything needs to be equal

139
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,400
for I in range n right because look this

140
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,580
is checking the violation but obviously

141
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,220
we have to check the operative which is

142
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:08,819
that each wall connects to the next word

143
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,080
okay return any this is just checking if

144
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,000
any of them

145
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,680
satisfy everything okay the Time come

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,319
back stay if there are n-words

147
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,280
and each word has the length a what's

148
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,280
the type of next thing

149
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:33,259
times eight okay I have three Choice o n

150
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,259
o a no o and a okay

151
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,280
this is a simple question so what have

152
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,680
you learned today what's the most

153
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,440
important takeaway the sentence and we

154
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,080
use split to split the sentence string

155
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,539
into a list of words and now we just

156
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,940
have to go through n times and we are

157
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:54,000
suppose they are inwards and then check

158
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,580
for the violation if the coverage was

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,620
the last letter minus one is if it's not

160
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,960
equals to the beginning of the next row

161
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,580
I plus one then we return first

162
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,759
otherwise we'll retention and then the

163
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,620
place of paper is that the last word

164
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:09,720
last one is to chip be checked against

165
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,560
the first row and we can use the modulus

166
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,910
MRI erase yes yes yes okay let's see for

167
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,280
the day bye-bye
