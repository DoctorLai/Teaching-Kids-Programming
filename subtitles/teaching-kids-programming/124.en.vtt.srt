00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
picking three
 

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,109
picking three
picking three yeah i'm taking three okay

12
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
picking three yeah i'm taking three okay
 

13
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,230
picking three yeah i'm taking three okay
let's see

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240
let's see
 

15
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,349
let's see
two four three seven

picking three numbers let's see if you

20
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
picking three numbers let's see if you
 

21
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,910
picking three numbers let's see if you
can make a

22
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
can make a
 

23
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,709
can make a
number eight can you make a number eight

24
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
number eight can you make a number eight
 

25
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,190
number eight can you make a number eight
with

26
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
with
 

27
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,310
with
picking three numbers picking three

00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
picking three numbers picking three
 

29
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,270
picking three numbers picking three
numbers

30
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
numbers
 

31
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,830
numbers
it has to be three four three one we're

32
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
it has to be three four three one we're
 

33
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,389
it has to be three four three one we're
done

34
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
done
 

35
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,510
done
four three one okay all right so

36
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
four three one okay all right so
 

37
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,350
four three one okay all right so
that's the three songs any idea how

38
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
that's the three songs any idea how
 

39
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,430
that's the three songs any idea how
we're doing this

40
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
we're doing this
 

41
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,470
we're doing this
how are we doing this if it one sum it

42
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,480
how are we doing this if it one sum it
 

43
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,270
how are we doing this if it one sum it
will just be

44
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
will just be
 

45
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,990
will just be
eight yeah i know there's no one from

46
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
eight yeah i know there's no one from
 

47
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,189
eight yeah i know there's no one from
okay

48
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
okay
 

49
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,389
okay
anyway any idea if you

50
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
anyway any idea if you
 

51
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,910
anyway any idea if you
don't have any idea we can always what

52
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
don't have any idea we can always what
 

53
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,670
don't have any idea we can always what
three fourths yes whatever improve us

54
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
three fourths yes whatever improve us
 

55
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,510
three fourths yes whatever improve us
how are we moving it

56
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
how are we moving it
 

57
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,550
how are we moving it
we check each pair right okay

58
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
we check each pair right okay
 

59
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,149
we check each pair right okay
listen i j k so how many ways of i j

60
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
listen i j k so how many ways of i j
 

61
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,350
listen i j k so how many ways of i j
k so first of all i have a loop

62
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
k so first of all i have a loop
 

63
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,630
k so first of all i have a loop
going from i to this way yeah and then i

64
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
going from i to this way yeah and then i
 

65
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,190
going from i to this way yeah and then i
go

66
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
go
 

67
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,310
go
have another

68
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320

 

69
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,069

okay so what's the current complexity if

70
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
okay so what's the current complexity if
 

71
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,310
okay so what's the current complexity if
i go i i i blue first

72
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
i go i i i blue first
 

73
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,830
i go i i i blue first
the pairs i log in o and

74
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
the pairs i log in o and
 

75
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,590
the pairs i log in o and
square a1 oh and cubic

76
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
square a1 oh and cubic
 

77
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,510
square a1 oh and cubic
oh and come on yes because you're

78
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
oh and come on yes because you're
 

79
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,190
oh and come on yes because you're
picking three yeah yeah look

80
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
picking three yeah yeah look
 

81
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,469
picking three yeah yeah look
exactly because because look it's like

82
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
exactly because because look it's like
 

83
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,069
exactly because because look it's like
that alright look for i

84
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
that alright look for i
 

85
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,710
that alright look for i
if there are numbers yeah in range and

86
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
if there are numbers yeah in range and
 

87
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,590
if there are numbers yeah in range and
yeah

88
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
yeah
 

89
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,429
yeah
yeah and then what's going here for j

90
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
yeah and then what's going here for j
 

91
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,789
yeah and then what's going here for j
in range range i

92
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
in range range i
 

93
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,670
in range range i
right right and another loop all right

94
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
right right and another loop all right
 

95
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,870
right right and another loop all right
listen to me right

96
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
listen to me right
 

97
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,630
listen to me right
4k in range range what

98
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640

 

99
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,309

numbs range j because look

100
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
numbs range j because look
 

101
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,430
numbs range j because look
i t yeah look i

102
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
i t yeah look i
 

103
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,550
i t yeah look i
is from zero to n and when i pick i i

104
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
is from zero to n and when i pick i i
 

105
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,030
is from zero to n and when i pick i i
will pick

106
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
will pick
 

107
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,309
will pick
j which is zero to i right pick j yeah

108
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
j which is zero to i right pick j yeah
 

109
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,830
j which is zero to i right pick j yeah
and k will be zero to j right so in this

110
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
and k will be zero to j right so in this
 

111
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,790
and k will be zero to j right so in this
case look

112
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
case look
 

113
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,150
case look
this needs to end right all right

114
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
this needs to end right all right
 

115
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,509
this needs to end right all right
this is another n this is n okay

116
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
this is another n this is n okay
 

117
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,790
this is another n this is n okay
so what's the term complexity

118
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
so what's the term complexity
 

119
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,509
so what's the term complexity
cubic n times percent okay that's it and

120
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
cubic n times percent okay that's it and
 

121
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,030
cubic n times percent okay that's it and
then okay you can say if i

122
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
then okay you can say if i
 

123
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,070
then okay you can say if i
if not i plus num z plus numbers k

124
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
if not i plus num z plus numbers k
 

125
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,030
if not i plus num z plus numbers k
equals target then we become two right

126
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
equals target then we become two right
 

127
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,229
equals target then we become two right
yeah all right

128
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
yeah all right
 

129
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,990
yeah all right
and fourth okay so can we do better

130
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
and fourth okay so can we do better
 

131
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,390
and fourth okay so can we do better
can we do better all right can we do

132
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
can we do better all right can we do
 

133
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,750
can we do better all right can we do
better not brief

134
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
better not brief
 

135
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,990
better not brief
thing no proof of thing how how can we

136
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
thing no proof of thing how how can we
 

137
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,309
thing no proof of thing how how can we
do better without a profession

138
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
do better without a profession
 

139
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,350
do better without a profession
i give you a notebook

140
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
i give you a notebook
 

141
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,470
i give you a notebook
may not help me have this case okay how

142
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
may not help me have this case okay how
 

143
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,030
may not help me have this case okay how
do you

144
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
do you
 

145
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,280
do you
propose that with the notebook thing

146
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,290
propose that with the notebook thing
 

147
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,149
propose that with the notebook thing

yes i think your approach might work so

166
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
yes i think your approach might work so
 

167
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,830
yes i think your approach might work so
basically we don't work

168
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
basically we don't work
 

169
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,670
basically we don't work
yeah it depends on how you implement it

170
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
yeah it depends on how you implement it
 

171
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,949
yeah it depends on how you implement it
so face basically

172
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
so face basically
 

173
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,270
so face basically
we go through these and then we go

174
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
we go through these and then we go
 

175
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,190
we go through these and then we go
through the first number yeah

176
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
through the first number yeah
 

177
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,270
through the first number yeah
that's the first number and we remember

178
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
that's the first number and we remember
 

179
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,630
that's the first number and we remember
it right

180
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
it right
 

181
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,550
it right
we remember it yeah oh maybe

182
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
we remember it yeah oh maybe
 

183
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,710
we remember it yeah oh maybe
remember the the two sums let's talk

184
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
remember the the two sums let's talk
 

185
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,550
remember the the two sums let's talk
about two sum and then you'll find out

186
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
about two sum and then you'll find out
 

187
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:12,869
about two sum and then you'll find out
why

188
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
why
 

189
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,949
why
the why the threesome can be based on

190
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
the why the threesome can be based on
 

191
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:15,910
the why the threesome can be based on
twosome

192
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
twosome
 

193
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,110
twosome
so two something look if we all find two

194
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
so two something look if we all find two
 

195
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,909
so two something look if we all find two
numbers

196
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
numbers
 

197
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,710
numbers
remember we can go through and then if

198
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
remember we can go through and then if
 

199
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,590
remember we can go through and then if
it's not

200
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
it's not
 

201
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,310
it's not
if the target is not in the notebook we

202
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
if the target is not in the notebook we
 

203
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,390
if the target is not in the notebook we
put it in the notebook and we continue

204
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
put it in the notebook and we continue
 

205
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,030
put it in the notebook and we continue
looking for the target minus current

206
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
looking for the target minus current
 

207
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,310
looking for the target minus current
number right for example

208
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
number right for example
 

209
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,670
number right for example
look look two i'm looking for six yeah

210
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
look look two i'm looking for six yeah
 

211
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,790
look look two i'm looking for six yeah
okay it's six in the notebook no

212
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
okay it's six in the notebook no
 

213
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,030
okay it's six in the notebook no
no then i go here but i put a two here

214
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
no then i go here but i put a two here
 

215
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,310
no then i go here but i put a two here
right

216
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
right
 

217
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,430
right
yeah it's 4 in a notebook if a plus

218
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
yeah it's 4 in a notebook if a plus
 

219
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,909
yeah it's 4 in a notebook if a plus
a minus 1 ignore book no i put a 4 here

220
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
a minus 1 ignore book no i put a 4 here
 

221
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,670
a minus 1 ignore book no i put a 4 here
in the notebook do you get it

222
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
in the notebook do you get it
 

223
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,030
in the notebook do you get it
yeah all right does it make sense

224
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
yeah all right does it make sense
 

225
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,310
yeah all right does it make sense
yeah yeah okay so how can we apply the

226
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
yeah yeah okay so how can we apply the
 

227
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,590
yeah yeah okay so how can we apply the
two some

228
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
two some
 

229
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,870
two some
angle to the three sound

230
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
angle to the three sound
 

231
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,790
angle to the three sound
how do we apply this

232
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800

 

233
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,710

we go through these need to be looking

234
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
we go through these need to be looking
 

235
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,150
we go through these need to be looking
at the two okay

236
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
at the two okay
 

237
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,710
at the two okay
hold on the first number eric look how

238
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
hold on the first number eric look how
 

239
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,749
hold on the first number eric look how
about the first number

240
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
about the first number
 

241
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,749
about the first number
try two right yeah i know the first

242
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
try two right yeah i know the first
 

243
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,270
try two right yeah i know the first
number is two

244
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
number is two
 

245
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,070
number is two
and i'm the the sum of yeah the sum of

246
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
and i'm the the sum of yeah the sum of
 

247
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,749
and i'm the the sum of yeah the sum of
the next two number is six yes

248
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
the next two number is six yes
 

249
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,150
the next two number is six yes
yeah okay so the where's the next the

250
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
yeah okay so the where's the next the
 

251
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,909
yeah okay so the where's the next the
next where's the numbers i need to look

252
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
next where's the numbers i need to look
 

253
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,790
next where's the numbers i need to look
for

254
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
for
 

255
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,510
for
it's in excluding these two right all

256
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
it's in excluding these two right all
 

257
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,230
it's in excluding these two right all
right

258
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
right
 

259
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,670
right
so the problem becomes finding two sum

260
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
so the problem becomes finding two sum
 

261
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,550
so the problem becomes finding two sum
of six in this array right we already

262
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
of six in this array right we already
 

263
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,629
of six in this array right we already
know how to use the two sum right

264
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
know how to use the two sum right
 

265
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,150
know how to use the two sum right
so look if you can't find it you're

266
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
so look if you can't find it you're
 

267
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,390
so look if you can't find it you're
going to the next one next one okay four

268
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400

 

269
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,670

i'm looking for four two songs in this

270
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
i'm looking for four two songs in this
 

271
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,629
i'm looking for four two songs in this
array right how about

272
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
array right how about
 

273
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,189
array right how about
t because i already tried two so i don't

274
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
t because i already tried two so i don't
 

275
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,070
t because i already tried two so i don't
mean i don't

276
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
mean i don't
 

277
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,670
mean i don't
i don't need to look for this anymore

278
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
i don't need to look for this anymore
 

279
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,270
i don't need to look for this anymore
right all right

280
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
right all right
 

281
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,790
right all right
so look for can i find five six in

282
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
so look for can i find five six in
 

283
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,830
so look for can i find five six in
a four here three one

284
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
a four here three one
 

285
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,230
a four here three one
yeah three one so look three four three

286
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
yeah three one so look three four three
 

287
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,270
yeah three one so look three four three
one that's it yeah

288
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
one that's it yeah
 

289
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,870
one that's it yeah
does it make sense

290
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
does it make sense
 

291
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,909
does it make sense
so how remember how we're doing these

292
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
so how remember how we're doing these
 

293
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,870
so how remember how we're doing these
two thumb

294
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
two thumb
 

295
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,390
two thumb
one approach is to number three

296
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
one approach is to number three
 

297
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,749
one approach is to number three
no no sorted

298
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
no no sorted
 

299
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,390
no no sorted
two pointer yeah yeah that will be

300
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
two pointer yeah yeah that will be
 

301
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,390
two pointer yeah yeah that will be
easier so if we sort it

302
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
easier so if we sort it
 

303
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,950
easier so if we sort it
so first of all we sort it and then okay

304
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
so first of all we sort it and then okay
 

305
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,469
so first of all we sort it and then okay
i'm ready okay

306
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
i'm ready okay
 

307
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,070
i'm ready okay
okay

308
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080

 

309
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,070

we can brew first the two sum as well

310
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
we can brew first the two sum as well
 

311
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,710
we can brew first the two sum as well
but if we profess the two something the

312
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
but if we profess the two something the
 

313
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,790
but if we profess the two something the
complexity will be still and cubic right

314
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
complexity will be still and cubic right
 

315
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,029
complexity will be still and cubic right
and because both sum of two sum is n

316
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
and because both sum of two sum is n
 

317
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,469
and because both sum of two sum is n
square

318
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
square
 

319
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,870
square
using the applying the two sum on the

320
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
using the applying the two sum on the
 

321
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,909
using the applying the two sum on the
three sum

322
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
three sum
 

323
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,749
three sum
because the first number we need o n

324
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
because the first number we need o n
 

325
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,350
because the first number we need o n
right n times right

326
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
right n times right
 

327
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,550
right n times right
right all right yes yeah does it make

328
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
right all right yes yeah does it make
 

329
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,510
right all right yes yeah does it make
sense

330
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
sense
 

331
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,790
sense
okay using the uh

332
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
okay using the uh
 

333
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,510
okay using the uh
notebook make it end that's that's right

334
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
notebook make it end that's that's right
 

335
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,270
notebook make it end that's that's right
or two pointer using that so all

336
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
or two pointer using that so all
 

337
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,390
or two pointer using that so all
together the term complexity is what

338
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
together the term complexity is what
 

339
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,550
together the term complexity is what
n squared yeah one square so look we are

340
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
n squared yeah one square so look we are
 

341
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,710
n squared yeah one square so look we are
reducing in from blue force always

342
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
reducing in from blue force always
 

343
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,950
reducing in from blue force always
cubic to one square it's better right

344
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
cubic to one square it's better right
 

345
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,230
cubic to one square it's better right
it's much better right

346
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
it's much better right
 

347
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,510
it's much better right
does it make sense okay define threesome

348
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520

 

349
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,550

find lumps and target t

350
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
find lumps and target t
 

351
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,909
find lumps and target t
okay target okay look okay

352
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
okay target okay look okay
 

353
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,550
okay target okay look okay
and equals lens

354
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
and equals lens
 

355
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,469
and equals lens
then we how how are we sorting these

356
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
then we how how are we sorting these
 

357
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,749
then we how how are we sorting these
numbers array

359
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,270

how do we solve it merge

360
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
how do we solve it merge
 

361
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,390
how do we solve it merge

k will be equal to what can you guess i
 

387
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,230
k will be equal to what can you guess i
already know the first number is i and

388
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
already know the first number is i and
 

389
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,749
already know the first number is i and
then i need to

390
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
then i need to
 

391
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,629
then i need to
do the two sum here okay so this is the

392
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
do the two sum here okay so this is the
 

393
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,029
do the two sum here okay so this is the
first

394
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
first
 

395
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,309
first
first index and then this is the whole

396
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
first index and then this is the whole
 

397
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:30,869
first index and then this is the whole
array

398
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
array
 

399
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,310
array
this is n and what's here

400
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320

 

401
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,589

what's here i plus one yeah i plus one

402
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
what's here i plus one yeah i plus one
 

403
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,430
what's here i plus one yeah i plus one
and then this

404
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440

 

405
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,829

and minus one and minus one because they

406
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
and minus one and minus one because they
 

407
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,630
and minus one and minus one because they
default

408
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
default
 

409
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,269
default
yeah because the index is start from

410
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:49,279
yeah because the index is start from
 

411
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,310
yeah because the index is start from
zero okay

412
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
zero okay
 

413
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,590
zero okay
now all right look now y

414
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
now all right look now y
 

415
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,430
now all right look now y
j smaller than k what's missing

416
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
j smaller than k what's missing
 

417
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,750
j smaller than k what's missing
okay then let's let's put it s equals

418
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
okay then let's let's put it s equals
 

419
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,949
okay then let's let's put it s equals
let's put it

420
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
let's put it
 

421
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,990
let's put it
as numbers i plus

422
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
as numbers i plus
 

423
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,750
as numbers i plus
numbers let's put it in a number okay

424
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
numbers let's put it in a number okay
 

425
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,509
numbers let's put it in a number okay
you know s variable plus numbers k right

426
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
you know s variable plus numbers k right
 

427
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,870
you know s variable plus numbers k right
now look if s equals t

428
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
now look if s equals t
 

429
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,870
now look if s equals t
return

430
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880

 

431
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:34,890

what if s equals

432
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:34,900

 

433
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:42,340

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240

 

439
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:13,590

minus one minus equals one now

440
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600

 

441
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,630

because you're moving if it's smaller if

442
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
because you're moving if it's smaller if
 

443
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,470
because you're moving if it's smaller if
it's smaller i need to move the

444
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
it's smaller i need to move the
 

445
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,750
it's smaller i need to move the
lower hair lower lower pointer

446
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
lower hair lower lower pointer
 

447
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,550
lower hair lower lower pointer
i need to move it yeah return forward

448
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
i need to move it yeah return forward
 

449
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,269
i need to move it yeah return forward
here all right

450
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
here all right
 

451
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,870
here all right
yeah what's the time complexity

452
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
yeah what's the time complexity
 

453
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:36,310
yeah what's the time complexity
i think

454
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320

 

455
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,430

here look actually look at the accurate

456
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
here look actually look at the accurate
 

457
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,990
here look actually look at the accurate
complexities o and log n plus

458
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
complexities o and log n plus
 

459
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,509
complexities o and log n plus
here's o and here's our square

460
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
here's o and here's our square
 

461
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,509
here's o and here's our square
this this is trivial compared to oven

462
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
this this is trivial compared to oven
 

463
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,870
this this is trivial compared to oven
square right this is

464
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
square right this is
 

465
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,509
square right this is
o n times n this is all n times log n so

466
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
o n times n this is all n times log n so
 

467
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,990
o n times n this is all n times log n so
which is bigger

468
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
which is bigger
 

469
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,190
which is bigger
one yeah so we we just

470
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
one yeah so we we just
 

471
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,030
one yeah so we we just
discard this one and we remove the

472
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
discard this one and we remove the
 

473
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,550
discard this one and we remove the
trivial part because this is more

474
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
trivial part because this is more
 

475
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,150
trivial part because this is more
dominant

476
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
dominant
 

477
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,030
dominant
yeah this is this bigger part so we

478
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
yeah this is this bigger part so we
 

479
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,430
yeah this is this bigger part so we
don't

480
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
don't
 

481
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,990
don't
we ignore this right because this is

482
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
we ignore this right because this is
 

483
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,470
we ignore this right because this is
bigger

484
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
bigger
 

485
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,870
bigger
this is domination this is more

486
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
this is domination this is more
 

487
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,990
this is domination this is more
important almost

488
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
important almost
 

489
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,350
important almost
uh consuming okay

490
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
uh consuming okay
 

491
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,389
uh consuming okay
so what's that space complexity i won

492
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
so what's that space complexity i won
 

493
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,910
so what's that space complexity i won
oh i went square and four oh one yeah

494
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
oh i went square and four oh one yeah
 

495
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,069
oh i went square and four oh one yeah
because there are no

496
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
because there are no
 

497
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,110
because there are no
one you're guessing you're

498
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
one you're guessing you're
 

499
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,150
one you're guessing you're
oh not understanding oh i see you okay

500
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
oh not understanding oh i see you okay
 

501
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,829
oh not understanding oh i see you okay
so any questions so far

502
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
