1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
so

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,799
hello hello mr everybody

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,480
yes

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,800
okay so today we talk about a math

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
problem which mess passes which is

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,880
called

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,400
no how do you pronounce this i know it

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,960
taught

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,960
and i

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,599
so we have a three only three yeah we

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,359
have uh first of all we have three

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,079
three rods

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,559
so you know what

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,480
okay three dots so

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,920
this is a

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,480
this is b

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,480
this is c

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,399
so we okay so we have uh

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,800
a we call it disk okay we have disk and

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,800
disk

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,079
if they want this if they play

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,079
initially that these antics are placed

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,480
on the first

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,280
first node okay so if there's only n

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,719
equals one how many moves

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,760
does it take

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,680
to move this a to c given this condition

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,920
yeah you only

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,000
these these sticks yeah is usually the

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,080
smaller place on the larger one so

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,439
you'll be like that disc

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,400
yeah it'll be smaller or last one

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,560
place on the bigger one okay so this

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,040
uh

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,560
the smaller can only be placed on the

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,799
bigger one

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,040
and you're only allowed to move one at a

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,040
time one at a time

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,799
okay you can't take small you can move

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,520
one at a time

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,119
okay and we are we want to move all the

42
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,759
discs from the left right to left right

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,320
most which is from a to c

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,439
so if there's only one

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,040
then we can just do a just move it yeah

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,960
yeah

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,280
all right

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,360
okay so let's let's if we use the t to

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,840
to represent the number of the the

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,360
minimum moves okay the minimums t one

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,280
equals one is easier if n is one t one

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,450
equals one okay

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,510
more interesting the

54
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,510
[Music]

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,360
how are we moving this can you tell me b

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,360
has to be placed on a you know a company

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,040
plays on b okay because b is smaller

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,520
than a okay

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,000
so how can we move this a b to here from

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,000
a to c

61
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,080
b

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,959
put on b

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,280
yeah

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,239
a put on c

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,840
b

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,120
b

67
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,360
predominantly okay so let's how many

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,360
moves

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,319
okay let's try again

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,680
one

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,640
two

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,560
three

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,440
okay three moves

74
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,280
okay now it's more interesting

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,280
see okay there are three three discs

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,280
okay come on play again

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,840
be

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,760
can see put on b yes yes

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,760
i

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,720
oh i mean c

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,959
and then

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,959
a

83
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,239
you want to restart you can restart i

84
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,480
think

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,239
i think there's something you know the

86
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,239
opposite out there because eventually

87
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,000
you want to put a to c and now at least

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,040
taken the place

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
yeah

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,080
so we start

91
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,080
yeah don't worry let's do it again

92
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,799
um

93
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,280
so five plus two seven okay

94
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,639
okay

95
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,960
great job so

96
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,199
okay so if there are n it gets more

97
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,360
complicated right if like four five six

98
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,600
it gets more complicated but the

99
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,600
the essentials are the same

100
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,240
so what are we trying what have we done

101
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,160
here is we want to move

102
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,520
the top layer and if there are any if

103
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,919
there are n here

104
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,520
we're going to move like n minus one

105
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,680
yeah minus one

106
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,240
it's excluding the last one yeah we want

107
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,440
to move these these two

108
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
here right

109
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,000
yeah

110
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
and i will move through here to here

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,720
right

112
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,800
yeah what why do we need to put it on c

113
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,360
because this is the target from a to c

114
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,479
we're moving everything from a yeah yeah

115
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,280
so

116
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,600
we this process is similar we just need

117
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,360
to this f minus we want to move the n

118
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,160
minus one but we don't know how to move

119
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,639
here but we can move this n minus one to

120
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,360
the middle right yeah

121
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,400
and now we move this because it's only

122
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,000
one now right so i only move it to here

123
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,360
and what's next i want to move these two

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,080
back to here all right

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,560
yeah so now every three step

126
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,039
two step so

127
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,800
so look

128
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,600
tn

129
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,360
equals first of all i want to move these

130
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,759
to here right

131
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,880
let's t a minus one right

132
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,639
yeah

133
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,160
plus here

134
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,919
plus one

135
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,840
then n minus one again

136
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,319
all right

137
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,919
okay so what is the equal t n equals two

138
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,880
times t n minus one plus one okay so can

139
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,199
you tell me what's t4

140
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,120
based on this t n equals two times t and

141
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,710
minus some previous one plus so what's t

142
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,479
four

143
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,600
[Music]

144
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,039
p three is seven t four is two times of

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,000
t three plus one

146
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,000
two times seven

147
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,560
yeah so yeah like that

148
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,400
so

149
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,560
so what's this equal okay what's this

150
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,560
equal but let's we can prove it

151
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:48,400
t one equals one t n equals two times t

152
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,400
n minus one plus one

153
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,720
okay so remember we talked about the

154
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
mathematic induction before right

155
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
what does it what does it mean is that

156
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,720
it's a message

157
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,120
storage to prove that a phenomena

158
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,479
stands how do we prove it we have a

159
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,919
formula we prove that t the basic case t

160
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,039
one it

161
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,759
uh stands and then we're assuming

162
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,039
t

163
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,199
k

164
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,280
and then we want to prove that t k minus

165
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,599
one also a plus one also exists okay

166
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,160
let's do this and then you understand

167
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,560
okay so actually this t n

168
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,960
is equals two times to the power of n

169
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,039
minus one remember the t one

170
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,080
equals one t two equals three t three

171
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,160
equals seven yeah t four equals

172
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,960
fifteen yeah two to two to the power of

173
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,360
four four sixty minus one fifteen two to

174
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,800
the power of three a minus one seven two

175
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,960
to the power of two

176
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,680
four minus one three two to the power of

177
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,599
1 2 minus 1.

178
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,199
yeah this is the equation but how can we

179
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,800
prove this is all right

180
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:56,560
t1 we just prove it when n is 1 is 1 t1

181
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,520
equals 1. that's fine if let's say tk

182
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
let's say t x yeah t x

183
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,879
t x

184
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,599
was t x equals two to the power of x

185
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,599
minus one right and that was t x plus

186
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,680
one t x plus one

187
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,840
equals one

188
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,840
t x plus one equals one two times this

189
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,840
we have two times t x two times

190
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,720
two t x plus one equals two times t x

191
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,639
two times t

192
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,039
x plus one right so this is 2 times

193
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,880
this bit

194
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,680
2 x minus 1 plus 1 right

195
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,599
yeah

196
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,599
so equals to a 2 2 times 2 x is 2 times

197
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,200
x plus 1 minus 2 plus one what's the

198
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,000
minus two plus one

199
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,920
look if we substitute this t x with

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,320
these then we can get this

201
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,000
two times two x plus one minus two plus

202
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,000
one is one

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,360
is what is minus two plus one

204
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,959
uh

205
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,920
oh no it's not all two t x is two

206
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,160
two x

207
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,720
is my two minus one right two x plus one

208
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,360
look t x plus one equals two x plus one

209
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,800
minus one okay so you look it also works

210
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,839
yeah because look

211
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,279
all right

212
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:16,720
x plus one yeah substitute so it also

213
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,560
uh it proves that t n equals two and

214
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,880
minus one because t n

215
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,600
plus one equals two times and two to the

216
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,200
power n plus 1 minus 1 i is the same

217
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,279
it's the same form

218
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,240
okay

219
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,600
uh

220
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,519
yeah

221
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,080
so we can write this simulation okay we

222
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,080
can write this simulation

223
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,800
define move okay let's move

224
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,120
how many disks and disk

225
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,640
we want to move from

226
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,600
source

227
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,920
to

228
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,320
destination yeah and then we have a

229
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,760
another road another road

230
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,760
temp let's call it temp okay

231
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,519
if n equals one what does it mean if we

232
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,640
only have one

233
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,680
we just move yeah we just move if any

234
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,240
goes wrong let's just move it print

235
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,920
okay move

236
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,480
disk

237
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,920
okay i'm just like this one

238
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,600
from

239
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,200
sauce

240
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,880
to

241
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
destination yeah because there's only

242
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,880
one right and then we do ten

243
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,160
okay there's only one i thought two's

244
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,120
spell disc is d i s

245
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,640
c

246
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,320
yeah oh that's maybe americans english i

247
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,320
don't know deep

248
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,320
d-i-d-i-s-k-d-i-s-c

249
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,920
yeah similar okay

250
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,240
return okay if not look we move what we

251
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,240
move

252
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,320
okay

253
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,360
if there are more than one so what do we

254
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,000
do what do we do remember what do we do

255
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,000
what do we do

256
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,560
if there are more than one we move the

257
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,360
top and minus one right minus one

258
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,360
from sauce

259
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,120
from sauce to to the term yeah turn the

260
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,200
middle one right

261
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,519
yeah

262
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,880
to the middle one and we use the

263
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,959
destination as a

264
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,279
you know intermediate term yeah and then

265
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,519
we need to do a print

266
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,360
we now we want to move what

267
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,600
move

268
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,000
move disk

269
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,839
and at this end

270
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,120
from

271
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,839
what

272
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,839
from source

273
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,360
and then to this is a normal to

274
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,360
destination

275
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,279
and then now

276
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
what's next we need to move this n minus

277
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,800
one yeah

278
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,399
move

279
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,399
n minus one

280
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,519
front

281
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,519
forward front forward

282
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,040
destination to use the destination and

283
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,200
we need to move from because now it's in

284
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,600
a destination right so we need to move

285
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,519
from destination

286
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,959
yeah

287
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,959
to uh

288
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,959
uh

289
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,630
[Music]

290
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,920
so actually it is because now it's in

291
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,480
slot testing is in the temp yeah

292
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,480
this is 10 10 we want to move to

293
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,720
destination yeah

294
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,959
destination right we'll move here 10

295
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,360
because look i already previously moved

296
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,440
enter minus one from source to ten

297
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,800
the middle one is the ten one and i want

298
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,240
to move the from the two one to the

299
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,720
destination

300
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,600
right and i'm using

301
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,639
the

302
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,040
source as the intermediate one as a term

303
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,720
right so let's restart here

304
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,480
okay

305
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,360
i know that's the agreement to solve and

306
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,160
you know arbitrary end you can put 100

307
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,079
here

308
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,040
and the computer will print the step for

309
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,720
you

310
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,839
correct

311
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,360
yeah

312
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,920
so you see so so

313
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,079
if your n equals four it's easy

314
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,399
your recursion look this is the question

315
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,800
yeah because because we are recursioning

316
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,040
solving n minus one right

317
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,600
because we are focusing on one one time

318
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,120
one step at a time we want to move the

319
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,519
end disc

320
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,880
all we want to focus is move the top n

321
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,880
minus one

322
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,040
top n minus one yeah

323
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,440
we want to move the top n minus one from

324
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,360
source to the middle one right

325
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,160
and then i want to move this the second

326
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,600
step move this to the destination and i

327
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,120
want to move these

328
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,320
to here

329
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:04,000
right yeah that's the question

330
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,480
okay okay so let's say if t

331
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,650
like one test

332
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,079
t

333
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,360
[Music]

334
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,959
five equals how many steps

335
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,040
remember the equation

336
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,920
i just proved before that two to the

337
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,040
power of n minus 1

338
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,040
so 2 to the power of 5

339
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:33,279
15

340
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:36,320
41 31 yes 31 okay got it yeah got it

341
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,320
any questions so far

342
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,000
any questions

343
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,480
okay good job okay that's it for today

344
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,079
