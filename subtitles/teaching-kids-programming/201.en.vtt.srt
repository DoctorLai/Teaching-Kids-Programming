how i i i want to rotate at least 90

18
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
how i i i want to rotate at least 90

yeah there'll be seven four one
 

23
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:36,090
yeah there'll be seven four one
so how can we say this eight four

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
then look four and two seven and
 

43
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,350
then look four and two seven and
three six and eight right

three six and eight right
 

45
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,910
three six and eight right
yeah and then you reverse this bit

46
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
yeah and then you reverse this bit

place anti-clockwise me one easy way
 

77
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,309
place anti-clockwise me one easy way
i mean you can think about it how did i

78
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
i mean you can think about it how did i
 

79
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,150

let me think

83
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,470

yours yep three six nine

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
yours yep three six nine
 

85
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,110
yours yep three six nine
so you turn this way so it's three six

86
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
so you turn this way so it's three six
 

87
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,990
so you turn this way so it's three six
nine

91
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,070
two five eight one four seven
okay it turns out uh this way doesn't

92
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
okay it turns out uh this way doesn't
 

93
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,309
okay it turns out uh this way doesn't
make sense

00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
make sense
 

95
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,110
make sense
okay yeah i think you just do this one

96
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
okay yeah i think you just do this one
 

97
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,070
okay yeah i think you just do this one
and just do

98
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
and just do
 

99
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,070
and just do
the line this way instead of this way

100
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
the line this way instead of this way
 

101
00:02:48,080 --> 00:03:01,990
the line this way instead of this way
when you do the line

102
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000

 

103
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,309

how do you know how do you know it's

104
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
how do you know how do you know it's
 

105

how do you know how do you know it's
land here

107
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,270

because this is the answer

108
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
because this is the answer
 

109
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,670
because this is the answer
and then it's like you put it on you did

110
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
and then it's like you put it on you did
 

111
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,030
and then it's like you put it on you did
a line here

112
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
a line here
 

113
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,990
a line here
so you just swap it

114
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000

 

115
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,990

okay yeah you so you mean swap the road

116
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
okay yeah you so you mean swap the road
 

117
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,390
okay yeah you so you mean swap the road
yeah

118

well yeah observation yes yes
 

121
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,149
well yeah observation yes yes
so we we instead of swapping each row we

122
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
so we we instead of swapping each row we
 

123
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,949
so we we instead of swapping each row we
swap

124
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
swap
 

125
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,229
swap
rose yeah so this throws super yeah yeah

126
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239

oh another easy way i was going to to
 

129
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,309
oh another easy way i was going to to
tell you that you can

130
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
tell you that you can
 

131
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,229
tell you that you can
clockwise how many times i make it

132
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
clockwise how many times i make it
 

133
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,390
clockwise how many times i make it
anticlockwise

134
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
anticlockwise
 

135
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,430
anticlockwise
huh but this

136
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
huh but this
 

137
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,670
huh but this
is clockwise uh you you want to turn

138
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
is clockwise uh you you want to turn
 

139
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,630
is clockwise uh you you want to turn
this thing

140
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
this thing
 

141
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,270
this thing
anti-clockwise here and then if you i

142
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
anti-clockwise here and then if you i
 

143
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,030
anti-clockwise here and then if you i
want you to make it clockwise how many

144
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
want you to make it clockwise how many
 

145
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,789
want you to make it clockwise how many
times it needs to be

146
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
times it needs to be
 

147
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,830
times it needs to be
to become one cup yeah whatever

148
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
to become one cup yeah whatever
 

149
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,830
to become one cup yeah whatever
so it's the same right you

150
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
so it's the same right you
 

151
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,710
so it's the same right you
anti-clockwise three times you'll become

152
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
anti-clockwise three times you'll become
 

153

clockwise
 

155
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,830
clockwise
you clockwise three times you become

156
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
you clockwise three times you become
 

157
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,589
you clockwise three times you become
what anti-clockwise right

158
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
what anti-clockwise right
 

159
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,830
what anti-clockwise right
yeah that's another way if you really

160
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
yeah that's another way if you really
 

161
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,589
yeah that's another way if you really
can't figure out that way right

00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199

 

175
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,510

column if not metric if it is empty we

176
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
column if not metric if it is empty we
 

177
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,510
column if not metric if it is empty we
just return okay

178
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
just return okay
 

179
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,749
just return okay
and now we return uh we want to create a

180
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
and now we return uh we want to create a
 

181
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,230
and now we return uh we want to create a
new metric which we call it t

182
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
new metric which we call it t
 

183
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,270
new metric which we call it t
uh okay let's do the rows first okay the

184
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
uh okay let's do the rows first okay the
 

185
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,990
uh okay let's do the rows first okay the
rows

186
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
rows
 

187
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,590
rows
and column equals the length of m

188
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
and column equals the length of m
 

189
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,350
and column equals the length of m
and what's the column length of m0 okay

190
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
and what's the column length of m0 okay
 

191
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,590
and what's the column length of m0 okay
yeah so that's the number of rows let's

192
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
yeah so that's the number of rows let's
 

193
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,670
yeah so that's the number of rows let's
the columns right

194
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
the columns right
 

195
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,469
the columns right
and then i want to create a new eric

196
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
and then i want to create a new eric
 

197
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,430
and then i want to create a new eric
look

198
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
look
 

199
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,710
look
one two three four five six if i

200
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
one two three four five six if i
 

201
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,150
one two three four five six if i
transpose this

202
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
transpose this
 

203
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,150
transpose this
you this is three color three rows and

204
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
you this is three color three rows and
 

205
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,310
you this is three color three rows and
two columns right yeah

206
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
two columns right yeah
 

207
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,230
two columns right yeah
if i transpose it and what what do i get

208
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
if i transpose it and what what do i get
 

209
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,310
if i transpose it and what what do i get
look what do i get with this if i

210
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
look what do i get with this if i
 

211
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,270
look what do i get with this if i
transpose

212
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280

 

213
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,469

[Music]

214
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
[Music]
 

215
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,390
[Music]
i look at what

216
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400

 

217
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,710

i transpose this one what do i get

218
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720

 

219
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,070

the rows will become the

220
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
the rows will become the
 

221
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,270
the rows will become the
the new metric the rows will become

222
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
the new metric the rows will become
 

223
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,189
the new metric the rows will become
original columns the columns will become

224
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
original columns the columns will become
 

225
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,670
original columns the columns will become
rows so it will be one three five

226
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
rows so it will be one three five
 

227
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,950
rows so it will be one three five
two four six right and this is two rows

228
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
two four six right and this is two rows
 

229
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,150
two four six right and this is two rows
and three columns yeah

230
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
and three columns yeah
 

231
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,710
and three columns yeah
the dimension has changed look yeah look

232
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
the dimension has changed look yeah look
 

233
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,110
the dimension has changed look yeah look
this dimension has changed to here right

234
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
this dimension has changed to here right
 

235
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,790
this dimension has changed to here right
right yes here look at this one

236
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
right yes here look at this one
 

237
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,070
right yes here look at this one
this one is 2 1

238
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
this one is 2 1
 

239
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,110
this one is 2 1
1 right 1 1 the index is one one the

240
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
1 right 1 1 the index is one one the
 

241
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,550
1 right 1 1 the index is one one the
original is also one

242
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
original is also one
 

243
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,029
original is also one
and this one is original this one two

244
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
and this one is original this one two
 

245
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,270
and this one is original this one two
one and then here you become one two

246
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
one and then here you become one two
 

247
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,390
one and then here you become one two
right

248
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
right
 

249
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,909
right
yeah one zero one one two

250
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
yeah one zero one one two
 

251
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,070
yeah one zero one one two
three so the num so for example this one

252
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
three so the num so for example this one
 

253
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,029
three so the num so for example this one
the index if

254
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
the index if
 

255
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,189
the index if
it's i j right and then when it goes to

256
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
it's i j right and then when it goes to
 

257
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,270
it's i j right and then when it goes to
the transpose it will become y

258
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
the transpose it will become y
 

259
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,629
the transpose it will become y
the index will become what

260
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639

 

261
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,029

j i right that's what i mean swap the

262
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
j i right that's what i mean swap the
 

263
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,230
j i right that's what i mean swap the
rows and columns

264
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
rows and columns
 

265
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,870
rows and columns
so here why why would we need to know

266
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
so here why why would we need to know
 

267
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,790
so here why why would we need to know
this because

268
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
this because
 

269
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,629
this because
the rc and then i need to create the

270
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
the rc and then i need to create the
 

271
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,510
the rc and then i need to create the
metric t equals

272
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
metric t equals
 

273
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,950
metric t equals
at the beginning i put it

274
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960

 

275
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,110

0 for underscore in

276
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
0 for underscore in
 

277
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,309
0 for underscore in
range ah okay that's the columns

278
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
range ah okay that's the columns
 

279
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,430
range ah okay that's the columns
and then for underscore

280
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
and then for underscore
 

281
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,950
and then for underscore
in range what

282
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
in range what
 

283
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,390
in range what
let's the rose will become y r c

284
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
let's the rose will become y r c
 

285
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,990
let's the rose will become y r c
c c r c

286
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
c c r c
 

287
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,469
c c r c
the original is r times c right and then

288
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
the original is r times c right and then
 

289
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,469
the original is r times c right and then
after i create this this becomes c

290
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
after i create this this becomes c
 

291
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,270
after i create this this becomes c
times r okay this is the metric for c

292
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
times r okay this is the metric for c
 

293
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,710
times r okay this is the metric for c
times up

294
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
times up
 

295
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,390
times up
r columns are columns and then

296
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
r columns are columns and then
 

297
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,430
r columns are columns and then
zeros okay correct

298
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
zeros okay correct
 

299
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,350
zeros okay correct
right yeah

300
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360

 

301
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,350

okay so now i'll look then i can do this

302
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
okay so now i'll look then i can do this
 

303
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,990
okay so now i'll look then i can do this
for ah

304
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
for ah
 

305
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,790
for ah

in red c
 

311
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,909
in red c
right look at the original this t

312
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
right look at the original this t
 

313
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,150
right look at the original this t
can you tell me what do i put here the

314
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
can you tell me what do i put here the
 

315
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,230
can you tell me what do i put here the
index equals the original is

316
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
index equals the original is
 

317
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,629
index equals the original is
m right m r c

318
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
m right m r c
 

319
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,469
m right m r c
so what do your happen here c

320
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
so what do your happen here c
 

321
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,309
so what do your happen here c
c i yeah return

322
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
c i yeah return
 

323
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,550

come on it's very obvious what are we

328
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
come on it's very obvious what are we
 

329
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,350
come on it's very obvious what are we
doing here we're talking

330

okay we are creating a new metric

334
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
okay we are creating a new metric
 

335
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,950
okay we are creating a new metric
so the space complexities of rc the time

336
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
so the space complexities of rc the time
 

337
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,749
so the space complexities of rc the time
complexity

338
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:23,759
complexity
 

339
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,670
complexity
is what come on

340
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
is what come on
 

341
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,790
is what come on
very obvious what

342
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
very obvious what
 

343
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,909
very obvious what
sorry why is that one come on

344
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919

 

345
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,990

we are transposing we we need to visit

346
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
we are transposing we we need to visit
 

347
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,430
we are transposing we we need to visit
each element

348
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440

 

349
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,150

yeah i i mean i want you to represent

350
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
yeah i i mean i want you to represent
 

351
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,310
yeah i i mean i want you to represent
the complexity using r and c what's r

352
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
the complexity using r and c what's r
 

353
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,829
the complexity using r and c what's r
and c

354
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839

 

355
00:08:52,839 --> 00:09:00,870

oh

356
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880

 

357
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,670

look here is two that's very obvious r

358
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
look here is two that's very obvious r
 

359
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,630
look here is two that's very obvious r
and c come on why is it a one right

360
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
and c come on why is it a one right
 

361
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,110
and c come on why is it a one right
a space complexity here this is creating

362
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
a space complexity here this is creating
 

363
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,230
a space complexity here this is creating
a new metric

364
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240

 

365
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,470

yeah yeah time conversion this is time

366
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
yeah yeah time conversion this is time
 

367
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,310
yeah yeah time conversion this is time
complexity and let's space complexity

368
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
complexity and let's space complexity
 

369
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,590
complexity and let's space complexity
here right

370
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
here right
 

371
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,990
here right
we're allocating the space for the new

372
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
we're allocating the space for the new
 

373
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,190
we're allocating the space for the new
metric yeah

374
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
metric yeah
 

375
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,470
metric yeah
it makes sense oh yeah

376
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
it makes sense oh yeah
 

377
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,630
it makes sense oh yeah
got it okay now

378
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640

 

379
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,030

so remember yesterday we talked about

380
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
so remember yesterday we talked about
 

381
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,389
so remember yesterday we talked about
reversing yeah

382
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
reversing yeah
 

383
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,110
reversing yeah
yeah let's say clockwise okay let's just

384
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
yeah let's say clockwise okay let's just
 

385
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,030
yeah let's say clockwise okay let's just
do this clockwise first

386
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
do this clockwise first
 

387
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,550
do this clockwise first
clockwise and m equals

388
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
clockwise and m equals
 

389
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,670
clockwise and m equals
okay we use this to say i want to replay

390
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
okay we use this to say i want to replay
 

391
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,470
okay we use this to say i want to replay
uh i want to erase i want to replace the

392
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
uh i want to erase i want to replace the
 

393
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,910
uh i want to erase i want to replace the
content of magic

394
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
content of magic
 

395
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,509
content of magic
by transpose transpose

396
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
by transpose transpose
 

397
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,190
by transpose transpose
and then and then row equals

398
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
and then and then row equals
 

399
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,240
and then and then row equals
length of the new matrix

400
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,250
length of the new matrix
 

401
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,550
length of the new matrix
[Music]

402
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
[Music]
 

403
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,509
[Music]
okay and then look at everything

404
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
okay and then look at everything
 

405
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,389
okay and then look at everything
transfer okay

406
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
transfer okay
 

407
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,829
transfer okay
four row in range

408
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
four row in range
 

409
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,550
four row in range
this is yesterday's con common yeah m

410
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
this is yesterday's con common yeah m
 

411
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,509
this is yesterday's con common yeah m
m y and r each row i want to to reverse

412
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
m y and r each row i want to to reverse
 

413
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,069
m y and r each row i want to to reverse
this

414
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
this
 

415
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:24,710
this
how do i reverse this

416
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720

 

417
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,790

clockwise yeah and then if i can do

418
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
clockwise yeah and then if i can do
 

419
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,230
clockwise yeah and then if i can do
repeat these three times that'd be

420
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
repeat these three times that'd be
 

421
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,829
repeat these three times that'd be
anticlockwise that's one method

422
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
anticlockwise that's one method
 

423
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,389
anticlockwise that's one method
of doing right yeah you can say

424
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
of doing right yeah you can say
 

425
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,350
of doing right yeah you can say
anti-clockwise

426
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
anti-clockwise
 

427
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,069
anti-clockwise
i think this is my favorite time uh

428
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
i think this is my favorite time uh
 

429
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,470
i think this is my favorite time uh
that's fine

430
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
that's fine
 

431
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,630
that's fine
look if we're changing this because

432
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
look if we're changing this because
 

433
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,110
look if we're changing this because
anti-clockwise

434
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
anti-clockwise
 

435
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,910
anti-clockwise
clockwise and we can just do this

436
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
clockwise and we can just do this
 

437
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,430
clockwise and we can just do this
clockwise

438
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
clockwise
 

439
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,870
clockwise
tongue three and

440
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
tongue three and
 

441
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,230
tongue three and
yeah and clockwise and calculate

442
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
yeah and clockwise and calculate
 

443
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,750
yeah and clockwise and calculate
and yeah that's it yeah yeah you can set

444
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
and yeah that's it yeah yeah you can set
 

445
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,310
and yeah that's it yeah yeah you can set
it to

446
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
it to
 

447
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,310
it to
my and okay so that's one way of doing

448
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
my and okay so that's one way of doing
 

449
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,670
my and okay so that's one way of doing
the app

450
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680

 

451
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,949

okay one thing i want to mention is that

452
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
okay one thing i want to mention is that
 

453
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,829
okay one thing i want to mention is that
this is not in place what is in place is

454
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
this is not in place what is in place is
 

455
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,190
this is not in place what is in place is
changing the

456
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
changing the
 

457
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,470
changing the
changing the numbers without allocating

458
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
changing the numbers without allocating
 

459
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,350
changing the numbers without allocating
a new one

460
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
a new one
 

461
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,190
a new one
this is we are allocating a new one

462
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
this is we are allocating a new one
 

463
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,829
this is we are allocating a new one
right okay

464
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
right okay
 

465
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,190
right okay
but if we i tell you the dimension is n

466
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
but if we i tell you the dimension is n
 

467
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,750
but if we i tell you the dimension is n
times n

468
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
times n
 

469
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,150
times n
it means that it's a square metric right

470
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
it means that it's a square metric right
 

471
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,430
it means that it's a square metric right
it's a square metric

472
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
it's a square metric
 

473
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,269
it's a square metric
right yeah three times three four times

474
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
right yeah three times three four times
 

475
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:33,910
right yeah three times three four times
three

476
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
three
 

477
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,150
three
it's a square magic then we can do this

478
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
it's a square magic then we can do this
 

479
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,990
it's a square magic then we can do this
in in in place

480
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
in in in place
 

481
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,030
in in in place
in no time in place what's what's in

482
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
in no time in place what's what's in
 

483
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,990
in no time in place what's what's in

484
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
place
 

485
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,590
place
so in place let's look for a second

486
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
so in place let's look for a second
 

487
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,509
so in place let's look for a second
and equals length m right arrogance

488
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
and equals length m right arrogance
 

489
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,550
and equals length m right arrogance
is in python n equals length

490
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
is in python n equals length
 

491
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,629
is in python n equals length
m that's the rows and the less columns

492
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
m that's the rows and the less columns
 

493
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,990
m that's the rows and the less columns
for i

494
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
for i
 

495
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,190
for i
in range n

in range n
 

497
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,629
in range n
right and then for j in

498
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:02,639
right and then for j in
 

499
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,870
right and then for j in
range what anyone

500
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
range what anyone
 

501
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,389
range what anyone
range f no it's quite easy to make a

502
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
range f no it's quite easy to make a
 

503
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,269
range f no it's quite easy to make a
mistake when

504
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
mistake when
 

505
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,470
mistake when
i because look one two three four five

506
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
i because look one two three four five
 

507
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,710
i because look one two three four five
six seven eight nine oh i want to change

508
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
six seven eight nine oh i want to change
 

509
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,430
six seven eight nine oh i want to change
okay look i want to change i want to

510
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
okay look i want to change i want to
 

511
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,069
okay look i want to change i want to
swap

512
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
swap
 

513
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,870
swap
along the diamond room right yeah all

514
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
along the diamond room right yeah all
 

515
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,350
along the diamond room right yeah all
right

516
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360
right
 

517
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,949
right
so all i need to itera is the these half

518
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
so all i need to itera is the these half
 

519
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,269
so all i need to itera is the these half
all these are right the top half of

520
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
all these are right the top half of
 

521
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,310
all these are right the top half of
bottom half right

522
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
bottom half right
 

523
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,790
bottom half right
you don't need to iterate always right

524
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
you don't need to iterate always right
 

525
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,030
you don't need to iterate always right
am right

526
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
am right
 

527
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,150
am right
yeah look if i swap here look

528
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
yeah look if i swap here look
 

529
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,230
yeah look if i swap here look
look i it right here four yeah you i

530
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
look i it right here four yeah you i
 

531
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,990
look i it right here four yeah you i
don't need to if i go to the four

532
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
don't need to if i go to the four
 

533
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,030
don't need to if i go to the four
i slow for you two right right if if i

534
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
i slow for you two right right if if i
 

535
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,790
i slow for you two right right if if i
go here again and

536
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
go here again and
 

537
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,870
go here again and
look if i swap it that will be two and

538
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
look if i swap it that will be two and
 

539
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,069
look if i swap it that will be two and
four right

540
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
four right
 

541
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,990
four right
and then if i go here again if i iterate

542
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
and then if i go here again if i iterate
 

543
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,069
and then if i go here again if i iterate
this again what happens

544
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
this again what happens
 

545
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,110
this again what happens
i swap it back right does it make sense

546
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
i swap it back right does it make sense
 

547
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,230
i swap it back right does it make sense
you stop it twice

548
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
you stop it twice
 

549
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,230
you stop it twice
that's not only one we just want to swap

550
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
that's not only one we just want to swap
 

551
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,509

591
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,069
three i want to swap
one two three i remember we can use what

how do we swap two points oh we can just

594
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
how do we swap two points oh we can just
 

595
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,310
how do we swap two points oh we can just
go through to the half yeah

596
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
go through to the half yeah
 

597
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,829
go through to the half yeah
so four j in

598
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839
so four j in
 

599
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,710
so four j in
range and divided by two

600
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
range and divided by two
 

601
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,550

and then look m r this is the row

602
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
and then look m r this is the row
 

603
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,660

what's this
 

621
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,030
what's this
zero one two two right the index right

622
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
zero one two two right the index right
 

623
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,470

how how do you get the 2 it's 3 minus 0

624
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:48,480
how how do you get the 2 it's 3 minus 0
 

625
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,590
how how do you get the 2 it's 3 minus 0

627
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,750
minus 1
3 is the number of elements in a row

628
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
3 is the number of elements in a row
 

629
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,829
3 is the number of elements in a row
yeah for example 1 2 3 4

630
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
yeah for example 1 2 3 4
 

631
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,030
yeah for example 1 2 3 4
5 6. i want to swap with these and this

632
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
5 6. i want to swap with these and this
 

633
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,389
5 6. i want to swap with these and this
right yes this is index one

634
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
right yes this is index one
 

635
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,710
right yes this is index one
and i want to calculate this index this

636
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
and i want to calculate this index this
 

637
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,230
and i want to calculate this index this
index equals what

638
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
index equals what
 

639
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,350
index equals what
six elements yeah six

640
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
six elements yeah six
 

641
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,949
six elements yeah six
six minus zero minus one

642
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
six minus zero minus one
 

643
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,230
six minus zero minus one
one minus one right so that's four

644
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
one minus one right so that's four
 

645
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,790
one minus one right so that's four
zero one two three four you see four is

646
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
zero one two three four you see four is
 

647
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,069
zero one two three four you see four is
it so it's

648
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
it so it's
 

649
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,910
it so it's
number of elements minus one minus j

650
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
number of elements minus one minus j
 

651
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,030
number of elements minus one minus j
that would be and i need to swap it okay

652
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
that would be and i need to swap it okay
 

653
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,829
that would be and i need to swap it okay
yeah okay so now if i i want to make it

654
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
yeah okay so now if i i want to make it
 

655
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,710
yeah okay so now if i i want to make it
anti-clockwise

656
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
anti-clockwise
 

657
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,389
anti-clockwise
instead of swapping the each row

667
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,310

have to go through
 

681
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,030
have to go through
the first half right the number of rows

682
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
the first half right the number of rows
 

683
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,749
the first half right the number of rows
have every look at this one

684
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759
have every look at this one
 

685
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:19,189
have every look at this one
yeah and i want to swap one all right

686
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199

 

687
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,949

minus r minus one right all right

688
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
minus r minus one right all right
 

689
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,350
minus r minus one right all right
yeah this is the number of rows mi is

690
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,360
yeah this is the number of rows mi is
 

691
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,150
yeah this is the number of rows mi is
here

692
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
here
 

693
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,350
here
and and minus r and r is here so i want

694
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
and and minus r and r is here so i want
 

695
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,829
and and minus r and r is here so i want
to swap it with these two so

696
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
to swap it with these two so
 

697
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,629
to swap it with these two so
m and minus equals what

698
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
m and minus equals what
 

699
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,790
m and minus equals what
how what should i put here

700
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800

 

701
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,829

easy mr m and minus

702
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
easy mr m and minus
 

703
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,269
easy mr m and minus
r minus one equals n and minus r minus

704
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
r minus one equals n and minus r minus
 

705
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:47,829
r minus one equals n and minus r minus
one is

706
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:47,839
one is
 

707
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,790
one is
n

708
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800

 

709
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,629

okay so you see let's let's swap him

710
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
okay so you see let's let's swap him
 

711
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,310
okay so you see let's let's swap him
when we stop him you'll be

712
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
when we stop him you'll be
 

713
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,749
when we stop him you'll be
anti-clockwise yeah yeah

714
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
anti-clockwise yeah yeah
 

715
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,590
anti-clockwise yeah yeah
yeah return return and

716
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600

 

717
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,949

no we don't need to swap it in the

718
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
no we don't need to swap it in the
 

719
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,789
no we don't need to swap it in the
middle right because you swap the middle

720
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
middle right because you swap the middle
 

721
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,710
middle right because you swap the middle
to the middle it doesn't change

722
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
to the middle it doesn't change
 

723
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,510
to the middle it doesn't change
yeah look you want to swap

724
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520

 

725
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,230

one two three four five no i mean do you

726
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
one two three four five no i mean do you
 

727
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,110
one two three four five no i mean do you
need to pick

728
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120
need to pick
 

729
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,470
need to pick
one space look you swap

730
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
one space look you swap
 

731
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,750
one space look you swap
one to five two to four three you can

732
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
one to five two to four three you can
 

733
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,470
one to five two to four three you can
swap with

734
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
swap with
 

735
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,270
swap with
itself or you don't need to do anything

736
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
itself or you don't need to do anything
 

737
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,990
itself or you don't need to do anything
even you do

738
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
even you do

00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
it it's the same right yeah okay so
 

741
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,110
it it's the same right yeah okay so
let's let's just swap in

742
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
let's let's just swap in
 

743
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,549
let's let's just swap in
okay any questions

744
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
okay any questions
 

745
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,669
okay any questions
any questions any questions um

746
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679

 

747
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,630

it's basically can you tell me why this

748
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
it's basically can you tell me why this
 

749
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:48,870
it's basically can you tell me why this
is

750
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:48,880
is
 

751
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,830
is
n minus two and divided by two okay no i

752
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
n minus two and divided by two okay no i
 

753
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,430
n minus two and divided by two okay no i
don't need you to write the curve

754
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
don't need you to write the curve
 

755
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,430
don't need you to write the curve
i just need you to explain to me why

756
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
i just need you to explain to me why
 

757
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,270
i just need you to explain to me why
this is n divided by two

758
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280
this is n divided by two
 

759
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,270
this is n divided by two
n is the number of rows one two

760
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
n is the number of rows one two
 

761
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,789
n is the number of rows one two
three four five six seven eight okay

762
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
three four five six seven eight okay
 

763
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,470
three four five six seven eight okay
so you technically just needed it and

764
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
so you technically just needed it and
 

765
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,909
so you technically just needed it and
divided by two yeah

766
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
divided by two yeah
 

767
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,190
divided by two yeah
because that's technically what do we do

768
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
because that's technically what do we do
 

769
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,430
because that's technically what do we do
here what do we do here

770
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
here what do we do here
 

771
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,350
here what do we do here
what do we do here

772
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360

 

773
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,470

we what are we trying to solve here

774
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
we what are we trying to solve here
 

775
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,710
we what are we trying to solve here
it's trying to solve the anticlockwise

776
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
it's trying to solve the anticlockwise
 

777
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,190
it's trying to solve the anticlockwise
yeah i mean here this bit after we

778
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
yeah i mean here this bit after we
 

779
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,070
yeah i mean here this bit after we
transpose

780
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,080
transpose
 

781
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,830
transpose
what are we doing here we want uh

782
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
what are we doing here we want uh
 

783
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,110
what are we doing here we want uh
until the middle yeah

784
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
until the middle yeah
 

785
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,630
until the middle yeah
what do i mean and swap it

786
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
what do i mean and swap it
 

787
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,750
what do i mean and swap it
so with this one to each one

788
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760

 

789
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,470

yeah and this one will do that yeah

790
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
yeah and this one will do that yeah
 

791
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,110
yeah and this one will do that yeah
right now

792
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
right now
 

793
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,549
right now
i know we just need to go through the

794
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
i know we just need to go through the
 

795
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,110
i know we just need to go through the
half that's what i mean divided by two

796
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
half that's what i mean divided by two
 

797
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,110
half that's what i mean divided by two
yeah half right and then mr will be here

798
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
yeah half right and then mr will be here
 

799
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,070
yeah half right and then mr will be here
right three that will be here right

800
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
right three that will be here right
 

801
