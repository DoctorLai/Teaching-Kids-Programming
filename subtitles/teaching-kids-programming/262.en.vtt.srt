00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:01,520
hello
 

3
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,830
hello
hello hello hello hello

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
hello hello hello hello
 

5
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,070
hello hello hello hello
hello mr miss ryan how are you all right

6
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
hello mr miss ryan how are you all right
 

7
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,589
hello mr miss ryan how are you all right
yes okay so today's test uh very simple

8
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
yes okay so today's test uh very simple
 

9
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,150
yes okay so today's test uh very simple
okay so today we got the uh

10
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,160
okay so today we got the uh
 

11
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,950
okay so today we got the uh
we got the magic

12
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
we got the magic
 

13
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,429
we got the magic
any metrics numbers yeah one zero

14
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:19,439
any metrics numbers yeah one zero
 

15
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,109
any metrics numbers yeah one zero
let's just make it simple only condense

16
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
let's just make it simple only condense
 

17
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,630
let's just make it simple only condense
one and zero okay

18
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
one and zero okay
 

19
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,269
one and zero okay
one zero zero okay only condense one

20
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
one zero zero okay only condense one
 

21
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,550
one zero zero okay only condense one
zeros okay so let's do this uh

22
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:28,560
zeros okay so let's do this uh
 

23
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,189
zeros okay so let's do this uh
so if if this is the matrix three times

24
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
so if if this is the matrix three times
 

25
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,229
so if if this is the matrix three times
three matrix so if we want to set the

26
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
three matrix so if we want to set the
 

27
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,190
three matrix so if we want to set the
um

28
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
um
 

29
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,869
um
if we want to set the matrix by zero if

30
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
if we want to set the matrix by zero if
 

31
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,910
if we want to set the matrix by zero if
if the

32
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
if the
 

33
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,630
if the
if the row contains zero okay so for

34
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640
if the row contains zero okay so for
 

35
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,709
if the row contains zero okay so for
example the first note contains yellow

36
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
example the first note contains yellow
 

37
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,389
example the first note contains yellow
so we i get it

38
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399
so we i get it
 

39
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,670
so we i get it
so can you and if it contains uh zero

40
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
so can you and if it contains uh zero
 

41
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,110
so can you and if it contains uh zero
for the color

42
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
for the color
 

43
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,790
for the color
can you write it

44
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:57,800

 

45
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:08,149

[Music]

47
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,750

good job so you understand the problem

48
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
good job so you understand the problem
 

49
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,710
good job so you understand the problem
yeah so we said that magic to zero if it

50
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
yeah so we said that magic to zero if it
 

51
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,030
yeah so we said that magic to zero if it
has the zero in

52
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
has the zero in
 

53
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,550
has the zero in
its row

54
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
its row
 

55
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,190
its row
or column right for example is zero so

56
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
or column right for example is zero so
 

57
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,910
or column right for example is zero so
you set all zero in this column and in

58
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
you set all zero in this column and in
 

59
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,710
you set all zero in this column and in
this row yeah you've got a zero here so

60
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
this row yeah you've got a zero here so
 

61
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,510
this row yeah you've got a zero here so
here and here and here here here but

62
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
here and here and here here here but
 

63
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,469
here and here and here here here but
only different this one okay

64
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
only different this one okay
 

65
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,550
only different this one okay
yeah yeah good point

66
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
yeah yeah good point
 

67
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,870
yeah yeah good point
you can go with the diagonal just the

68
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
you can go with the diagonal just the
 

69
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,350
you can go with the diagonal just the
horizontal and vertical so any idea how

70
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,360
horizontal and vertical so any idea how
 

71
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,870
horizontal and vertical so any idea how
we're solving this problem

72
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
we're solving this problem
 

73
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,069
we're solving this problem
we

74
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079

 

75
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,830

the first approach we need to think

76
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
the first approach we need to think
 

77
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,389
the first approach we need to think
about is what

78
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
about is what
 

79
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,590
about is what
is what if we don't have any ideas

80
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
is what if we don't have any ideas
 

81
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,380
is what if we don't have any ideas
sorry revolving

85
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,790

then what if it's a 0 then we

86
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
then what if it's a 0 then we
 

87
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,550
then what if it's a 0 then we
set all the numbers in its row

88
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
set all the numbers in its row
 

89
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,030
set all the numbers in its row
to 0 and it's columns

90
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
to 0 and it's columns
 

91
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,830
to 0 and it's columns
i like your columns as yellows yeah

92
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
i like your columns as yellows yeah
 

93
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,510
i like your columns as yellows yeah
but

94
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
but
 

95
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,309
but
there's a problem why is that

96
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
there's a problem why is that
 

97
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,710
there's a problem why is that
that's the people of doing right look if

98
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
that's the people of doing right look if
 

99
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,550
that's the people of doing right look if
i put it here right if this is a zero

100
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
i put it here right if this is a zero
 

101
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,830
i put it here right if this is a zero
yeah

102
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
yeah
 

103
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,589
yeah
how do you know this zero is at the

104
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
how do you know this zero is at the
 

105
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,630
how do you know this zero is at the
beginning

106
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
beginning
 

107
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,550
beginning
or not

108
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
or not
 

109
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,509
or not
so look at it when we reach this point

110
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
so look at it when we reach this point
 

111
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,150
so look at it when we reach this point
we set a set all the rows the row the

112
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
we set a set all the rows the row the
 

113
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,550
we set a set all the rows the row the
first row to double zero right

114
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
first row to double zero right
 

115
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,229
first row to double zero right
but how do you know but this is already

116
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
but how do you know but this is already
 

117
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,830
but how do you know but this is already
zero

118
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
zero
 

119
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,509
zero
but when you go to this zero how do you

120
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
but when you go to this zero how do you
 

121
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,150
but when you go to this zero how do you
know it's original zero or is it the one

122
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
know it's original zero or is it the one
 

123
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,150
know it's original zero or is it the one
we are already flipping

124
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
we are already flipping
 

125
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,030
we are already flipping
um

126
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
um
 

127
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,869
um
set

128
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
set
 

129
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,190
set
we need to remember yeah the first we

130
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
we need to remember yeah the first we
 

131
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,070
we need to remember yeah the first we
can oh we can do this no problem so

132
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
can oh we can do this no problem so
 

133
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,270
can oh we can do this no problem so
when we meet at zlo we remember

134
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
when we meet at zlo we remember
 

135
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,990
when we meet at zlo we remember
the row and the column right

136
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
the row and the column right
 

137
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,430
the row and the column right
yeah

138
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
yeah
 

139
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,270
yeah
yeah we remember the row and column and

140
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
yeah we remember the row and column and
 

141
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,149
yeah we remember the row and column and
then we when we finish all of it

142
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
then we when we finish all of it
 

143
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,750
then we when we finish all of it
when we finish iterating all the

144
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
when we finish iterating all the
 

145
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,390
when we finish iterating all the
elements in the rows in a matrix

146
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
elements in the rows in a matrix
 

147
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,509
elements in the rows in a matrix
we go through yeah we can push push this

148
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
we go through yeah we can push push this
 

149
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,070
we go through yeah we can push push this
row number and call the number into a

150
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
row number and call the number into a
 

151
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,350
row number and call the number into a
queue right

152
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
queue right
 

153
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,990
queue right
we push it into the queue

154
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
we push it into the queue
 

155
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,070
we push it into the queue
and now we go through all the rows and

156
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
and now we go through all the rows and
 

157
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,789
and now we go through all the rows and
columns in the queue

158
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
columns in the queue
 

159
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,910
columns in the queue
to to set all the rows

160
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
to to set all the rows
 

161
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,710
to to set all the rows
yeah and columns

162
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
yeah and columns
 

163
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,509
yeah and columns
to

164
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
to
 

165
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,070
to
zeros all right yeah

166
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
zeros all right yeah
 

167
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,949
zeros all right yeah
okay

168
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
okay
 

169
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,350
okay
so we can do this all

170
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
so we can do this all
 

171
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,509
so we can do this all
we can have two

172
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
we can have two
 

173
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,470
we can have two
two

174
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
two
 

175
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,110
two
sets we can have two sets one is the

176
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
sets we can have two sets one is the
 

177
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,589
sets we can have two sets one is the
rows

178
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599

 

179
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,309

one is the columns

180
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
one is the columns
 

181
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,149
one is the columns
what's the set can you tell me what's

182
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
what's the set can you tell me what's
 

183
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,589
what's the set can you tell me what's
set

184
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599

 

185
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,589

unique numbers yeah so if you look if

186
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
unique numbers yeah so if you look if
 

187
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,509
unique numbers yeah so if you look if
row stops at one

188
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
row stops at one
 

189
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,350
row stops at one
and row store another one it only

190
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
and row store another one it only
 

191
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,350
and row store another one it only
consists one right because it doesn't

192
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
consists one right because it doesn't
 

193
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,429
consists one right because it doesn't
contain the duplicate numbers right so

194
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
contain the duplicate numbers right so
 

195
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,589
contain the duplicate numbers right so
for example right right rows

196
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
for example right right rows
 

197
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,110
for example right right rows
dot add

198
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
dot add
 

199
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,590
dot add
one the first note and then rows

200
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
one the first note and then rows
 

201
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,189
one the first note and then rows
dot add

202
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
dot add
 

203
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,310
dot add
two

two
 

205
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,790
two
and then eric rose

206
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
and then eric rose
 

207
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,550
and then eric rose
stop at

208

stop at
 

209
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,230
stop at
one so can you tell me what happened in

210
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
one so can you tell me what happened in
 

211
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,790
one so can you tell me what happened in
the rose rose stock l1 rose a2 and rose

a1 so
what are the elements in the rows

216
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
what are the elements in the rows
 

217
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,030
what are the elements in the rows
sorry

218
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
sorry
 

219
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,909
sorry

one
 

225
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,950
one
one

226
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
one
 

227
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,749
one
two yeah one and two only it doesn't

228
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
two yeah one and two only it doesn't
 

229
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,830
two yeah one and two only it doesn't
have one because set

230
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
have one because set
 

231
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,550
have one because set
only contains the unique numbers right

232
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
only contains the unique numbers right
 

233
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,469
only contains the unique numbers right
right ryan yeah

234
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
right ryan yeah
 

235
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,550
right ryan yeah
so one because it's unique guys up here

236
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
so one because it's unique guys up here
 

237
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,790
so one because it's unique guys up here
before so we only record it once in a

238
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
before so we only record it once in a
 

239
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,430
before so we only record it once in a
sec yeah that's what it means so once we

240
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
sec yeah that's what it means so once we
 

241
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,270
sec yeah that's what it means so once we
have these rows and columns so what do

242
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
have these rows and columns so what do
 

243
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,950
have these rows and columns so what do
we what do we do now

244
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
we what do we do now
 

245
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,469
we what do we do now
what do we do

246
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
what do we do
 

247
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,590
what do we do
we iterate yeah we iterate the num two

248
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
we iterate yeah we iterate the num two
 

249
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,870
we iterate yeah we iterate the num two
leaves

250
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
leaves
 

251
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,670
leaves
and

252
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
and
 

253
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,830
and
we check if the current row if it's in

254
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
we check if the current row if it's in
 

255
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,950
we check if the current row if it's in
the rows

256
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
the rows
 

257
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,430
the rows
then we set it to zero right

258
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
then we set it to zero right
 

259
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,230
then we set it to zero right
or even like columns

260
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
or even like columns
 

261
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,029
or even like columns
even call the number in the columns

262
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
even call the number in the columns
 

263
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,189
even call the number in the columns
we set it to zero right

264
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
we set it to zero right
 

265
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,270
we set it to zero right
that's it do you understand

266
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
that's it do you understand
 

267
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,870
that's it do you understand
they understand

268
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
they understand
 

269
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,950
they understand
yeah because first of all we go through

270
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
yeah because first of all we go through
 

271
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,830
yeah because first of all we go through
these uh metrics we remember which we

272
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
these uh metrics we remember which we
 

273
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,790
these uh metrics we remember which we
call the number of we recorded rows and

274
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
call the number of we recorded rows and
 

275
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,070
call the number of we recorded rows and
columns

276
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
columns
 

277
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,390
columns
that contains yellows right

278
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
that contains yellows right
 

279
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,510
that contains yellows right
yeah

280
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
yeah
 

281
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,710
yeah
and then we go through the matrix again

282
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
and then we go through the matrix again
 

283
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,830
and then we go through the matrix again
and as

284
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
and as
 

285
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,230
and as
as we go through the metric we know

286
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
as we go through the metric we know
 

287
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,150
as we go through the metric we know
we know that row and column right and we

288
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
we know that row and column right and we
 

289
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,790
we know that row and column right and we
just have to check the row and column if

290
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
just have to check the row and column if
 

291
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,510
just have to check the row and column if
it's

292
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
it's
 

293
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,270
it's
been

294
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
been
 

295
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,510
been
in these two sets right

296
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
in these two sets right
 

297
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,670
in these two sets right
either one if it's in the rows or if

298
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
either one if it's in the rows or if
 

299
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,830
either one if it's in the rows or if
it's in the columns

300
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
it's in the columns
 

301
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,830
it's in the columns
then what do we do

302
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
then what do we do
 

303
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,710
then what do we do
we just do uh it raise it with a zero

304
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
we just do uh it raise it with a zero
 

305
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,749
we just do uh it raise it with a zero
right

306
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
right
 

307
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,830
right
that's it okay let's try

308
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
that's it okay let's try
 

309
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,189
that's it okay let's try
this is

310
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
this is
 

311
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,430
this is
not a difficult question okay

312
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
not a difficult question okay
 

313
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,670
not a difficult question okay
it's a medium default

314
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
it's a medium default
 

315
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,430
it's a medium default
define the set

316
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
define the set
 

317
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,629
define the set
zeros okay so matrix is zero let's do m

318
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
zeros okay so matrix is zero let's do m
 

319
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,830
zeros okay so matrix is zero let's do m
okay

320
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
okay
 

321
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,670
okay
first of all we need to remember the

322
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
first of all we need to remember the
 

323
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,670
first of all we need to remember the
number of the rows and columns okay so

324
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
number of the rows and columns okay so
 

325
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,430
number of the rows and columns okay so
let's do this r

326
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
let's do this r
 

327
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,230
let's do this r
c

328
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
c
 

329
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,029
c
equals what land m

330
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
equals what land m
 

331
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,629
equals what land m
and lens

332
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
and lens
 

333
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,550
and lens
and

334
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
and
 

335
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,189
and
zero okay let's just assume that this

336
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
zero okay let's just assume that this
 

337
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,590
zero okay let's just assume that this
metric is not empty okay it contains

338
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
metric is not empty okay it contains
 

339
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,390
metric is not empty okay it contains
only at least one element right the

340
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
only at least one element right the
 

341
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,270
only at least one element right the
minimum metric is this one yeah

342
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
minimum metric is this one yeah
 

343
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,950
minimum metric is this one yeah
one okay

344
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
one okay
 

345
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,270
one okay
just one okay this one

346
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
just one okay this one
 

347
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,550
just one okay this one
okay

348
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
okay
 

349
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,629
okay
so look now first of all we need to

350
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
so look now first of all we need to
 

351
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,350
so look now first of all we need to
contain the let's put the capital r

352
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
contain the let's put the capital r
 

353
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,670
contain the let's put the capital r
for the rows

354
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
for the rows
 

355
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,270
for the rows
capital c for the set for the column so

356
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
capital c for the set for the column so
 

357
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,790
capital c for the set for the column so
let's set

358
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
let's set
 

359
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,110
let's set
and then set okay two sets

360
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
and then set okay two sets
 

361
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,469
and then set okay two sets
then first of all we go through the

362
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
then first of all we go through the
 

363
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,189
then first of all we go through the
element in the row yeah oh why did you

364
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
element in the row yeah oh why did you
 

365
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,270
element in the row yeah oh why did you
do a casper

366
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
do a casper
 

367
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,950
do a casper
capitalized because

368
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
capitalized because
 

369
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,150
capitalized because
the the variables in the python is

370
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
the the variables in the python is
 

371
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,670
the the variables in the python is
capture us

372
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
capture us
 

373
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,469
capture us
is case sensitive okay so low uppercase

374
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
is case sensitive okay so low uppercase
 

375
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,629
is case sensitive okay so low uppercase
and the lowercase is different okay

376
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
and the lowercase is different okay
 

377
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,749
and the lowercase is different okay
so for look for let's say for i

378
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
so for look for let's say for i
 

379
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,950
so for look for let's say for i
in range when you are range

380
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
in range when you are range
 

381
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,629
in range when you are range
what what number

382
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
what what number
 

383
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:38,870
what what number
we didn't see each row for ranging one

384
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880

 

385
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,670

okay so look if magic i j if it's yellow

386
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
okay so look if magic i j if it's yellow
 

387
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,710
okay so look if magic i j if it's yellow
right

388
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
right
 

389
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,110
right
so what should we do if this current if

390
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
so what should we do if this current if
 

391
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,070
so what should we do if this current if
this if the row i

392
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
this if the row i
 

393
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,390
this if the row i
row i and column j

394
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
row i and column j
 

395
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,790
row i and column j
the element and row i column j is zero

396
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
the element and row i column j is zero
 

397
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,710
the element and row i column j is zero
so what do we need to do what do we need

398
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
so what do we need to do what do we need
 

399
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,760
so what do we need to do what do we need
to do um

400
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:03,770

c dot e
 

411
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,670
c dot e
come on

412
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
come on
 

413
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,309
come on
which one is column

414
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
which one is column
 

415
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,110
which one is column
which one is column which one is column

416
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
which one is column which one is column
 

417
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,790
which one is column which one is column
um

418
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
um
 

419
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,790
um
yeah that's it so first of all we go

420
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
yeah that's it so first of all we go
 

421
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,790
yeah that's it so first of all we go
through these elements and we found okay

422
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
through these elements and we found okay
 

423
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,950
through these elements and we found okay
so let's do that again zero one zero

424
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
so let's do that again zero one zero
 

425
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,350
so let's do that again zero one zero
one zero one

426
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
one zero one
 

427
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,870
one zero one
zero

zero
 

429
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,630
zero
uh let's do this one one one okay

430
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
uh let's do this one one one okay
 

431
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,709
uh let's do this one one one okay
so what what after these are gonna be

432
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
so what what after these are gonna be
 

433
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,389
so what what after these are gonna be
zeros okay let's place one okay so okay

434
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
zeros okay let's place one okay so okay
 

435
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,030
zeros okay let's place one okay so okay
so what happened for the r and c after

436
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
so what happened for the r and c after
 

437
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,949
so what happened for the r and c after
this these two loop

438
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
this these two loop
 

439
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,670
this these two loop
can you tell me what's r what's r

440
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
can you tell me what's r what's r
 

441
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,150
can you tell me what's r what's r
and what's c

442
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
and what's c
 

443
00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:06,550
and what's c
i is what

444
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560

 

445
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,190

zeros

446
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
zeros
 

447
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,590
zeros
come on it's easy zero

448
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
come on it's easy zero
 

449
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,030
come on it's easy zero
zero one yeah

450
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
zero one yeah
 

451
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,509
zero one yeah
okay i hope if i put this as zero as

452
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
okay i hope if i put this as zero as
 

453
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,550
okay i hope if i put this as zero as
well

454
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
well
 

455
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,509
well
so

456
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
so
 

457
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,750
so
does it change

458
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
does it change
 

459
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,670
does it change
no no this is the same is it the same

460
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
no no this is the same is it the same
 

461
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,230
no no this is the same is it the same
which columns contains the which flowers

462
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
which columns contains the which flowers
 

463
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,710
which columns contains the which flowers
contains zero and one

464
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
contains zero and one
 

465
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,350
contains zero and one
um

466
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360

 

467
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,949

yeah still assembly which columns it

468
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
yeah still assembly which columns it
 

469
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,350
yeah still assembly which columns it
contains the zero one

470
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
contains the zero one
 

471
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,350
contains the zero one
and the first one and the second one so

472
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
and the first one and the second one so
 

473
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,949
and the first one and the second one so
this is the other one yeah

474
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
this is the other one yeah
 

475
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,509
this is the other one yeah
that's what what happened this code

476
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
that's what what happened this code
 

477
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,630
that's what what happened this code
this bit of code will produce these two

478
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
this bit of code will produce these two
 

479
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,230
this bit of code will produce these two
all we need to do i know what should we
