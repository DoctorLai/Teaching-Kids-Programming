00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,830
do you still remember what we talked
about yesterday

00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:09,840

 

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,749

something about breakfast search here

8
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:11,759
something about breakfast search here
 

9
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,629
something about breakfast search here
yeah and it's like the binary tree

10
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:14,639
yeah and it's like the binary tree
 

11
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,180
yeah and it's like the binary tree
and we want what we want to do here

12
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,190
and we want what we want to do here
 

13
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,630

the maximum we find the level which has

16
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
the maximum we find the level which has
 

17
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,349
the maximum we find the level which has
the largest sum right

18
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,359
the largest sum right
 

19
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,070
the largest sum right
in this case regular level zero is one

20
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
in this case regular level zero is one
 

21
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,589
in this case regular level zero is one
level one is five

22
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
level one is five
 

23
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,190
level one is five
level two is four so we return level one

24
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,200
level two is four so we return level one
 

25
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,310
level two is four so we return level one
because if it has the largest sum five

26
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
because if it has the largest sum five
 

27
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,630
because if it has the largest sum five
right

28
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
right
 

29
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,670
right
remember how are we doing it

30
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
remember how are we doing it
 

31
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,030
remember how are we doing it
how are doing it uh using

32
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
how are doing it uh using
 

33
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,029
how are doing it uh using
this cube yeah which is what such

34
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
this cube yeah which is what such
 

35
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,430
this cube yeah which is what such
uh first breast research okay

36
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
uh first breast research okay
 

37
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,869
uh first breast research okay
so breakfast because we visit the world

38
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
so breakfast because we visit the world
 

39
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,150
so breakfast because we visit the world
uh visit the binary tree level by river

40
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
uh visit the binary tree level by river
 

41
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,709
uh visit the binary tree level by river
level by level and using a queue which

42
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
level by level and using a queue which
 

43
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,069
level by level and using a queue which
is

44
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079
is
 

45
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,109
is
first thing what q

00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
first thing what q
 

47
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,469
first thing what q
what's what's cube yeah in python

48
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
what's what's cube yeah in python
 

49
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,590
what's what's cube yeah in python
what are we using the stack

50
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
what are we using the stack
 

51
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,230
what are we using the stack
not the stack q it's just no queue what

52
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
not the stack q it's just no queue what
 

53
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,870
not the stack q it's just no queue what
what from

54
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
what from
 

55
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,469
what from
what class name of the queue are we

56
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
what class name of the queue are we
 

57
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,230
what class name of the queue are we
using in python

58
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240

dg dq yes dq double ndq right
so now today we can use the differences

62
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
so now today we can use the differences
 

63
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,230
so now today we can use the differences
so what's different search can you tell

64
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
so what's different search can you tell
 

65
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,469
so what's different search can you tell
me

66
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479

 

67
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,830

we're going as deep as we can okay so

68
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
we're going as deep as we can okay so
 

69
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,950
we're going as deep as we can okay so
for example if there are trees like that

70
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
for example if there are trees like that
 

71
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:45,990
for example if there are trees like that
five so what's the difference search

72
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000

yeah okay so so we can do a different
 

97
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,640
yeah okay so so we can do a different
search but we also need to

98
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:22,650
search but we also need to

work so we visit the note and then we

102
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
work so we visit the note and then we
 

103
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,710
work so we visit the note and then we
put the sum we

104
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
put the sum we
 

105
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,150
put the sum we
accumulate the sum of that level

106
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
accumulate the sum of that level
 

107
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,550
accumulate the sum of that level
with this the value of the current note

108
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
with this the value of the current note
 

109
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,270
with this the value of the current note
so

110
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
so
 

111
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,350
so
in order to do this we need to be

112
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
in order to do this we need to be
 

113
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,790
in order to do this we need to be
passing the

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
passing the
 

115
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,190
passing the
level in the definitions right yeah

116
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
level in the definitions right yeah
 

117
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,910
level in the definitions right yeah
somehow

118
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
somehow
 

119
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,550
somehow
when we recursively visit the node we

120
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
when we recursively visit the node we
 

121
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,070
when we recursively visit the node we
need to remember

122
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
need to remember
 

123
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,430
need to remember
which level it is right yeah yeah

124
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
which level it is right yeah yeah
 

125
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,949
which level it is right yeah yeah
yeah okay so so

126
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
yeah okay so so
 

127
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,030
yeah okay so so
define different search roots

128
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
define different search roots
 

129
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,630
define different search roots
so we also need a level yeah level

130
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
so we also need a level yeah level
 

131
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,149
so we also need a level yeah level
and labor and then we we let's

132
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
and labor and then we we let's
 

133
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,470
and labor and then we we let's
let's put it uh put it in a sound

134
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480

 

135
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,470

sum so sums is uh is a dictionary okay

136
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
sum so sums is uh is a dictionary okay
 

137
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,750
sum so sums is uh is a dictionary okay
something is dictionary with key

138
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
something is dictionary with key
 

139
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,229
something is dictionary with key
key is the level and the value

140
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
key is the level and the value
 

141
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,509
key is the level and the value
is the sum for that level right oh yeah

142
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
is the sum for that level right oh yeah
 

143
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,949
is the sum for that level right oh yeah
okay so look if load yes

144
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
okay so look if load yes
 

145
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,509
okay so look if load yes
is now what should we return what should

146
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
is now what should we return what should
 

147
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,630
is now what should we return what should
we do we just return

148
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
we do we just return
 

149
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,710
we do we just return
because it's now i know we just return

150
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
because it's now i know we just return
 

151
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,110
because it's now i know we just return
yeah okay

152
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
yeah okay
 

153
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,910
yeah okay
we can look we don't need to return

154
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
we can look we don't need to return
 

155
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,470
we can look we don't need to return
anything

156
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
anything
 

157
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,470
anything
because this is the function with return

158
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
because this is the function with return
 

159
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,470
because this is the function with return
and we don't need to return anything the

160
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
and we don't need to return anything the
 

161
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,190
and we don't need to return anything the
the purpose of this function is to

162
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
the purpose of this function is to
 

163
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,430
the purpose of this function is to
accumulate to update the level

164
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
accumulate to update the level
 

165
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,470
accumulate to update the level
to add the sum of the of end

166
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
to add the sum of the of end
 

167
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,910
to add the sum of the of end
node value of the load to the level

168
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
node value of the load to the level
 

169
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,589
node value of the load to the level
right all right all right yeah so look

170
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
right all right all right yeah so look
 

171
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,070
right all right all right yeah so look
so how do we add the root of value to

172
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
so how do we add the root of value to
 

173
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,949
so how do we add the root of value to
the levels

174
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
the levels
 

175
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,789
the levels
with the sum so look something is a

176
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
with the sum so look something is a
 

177
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,710
with the sum so look something is a
dictionary what did i just say

178
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
dictionary what did i just say
 

179
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,670
dictionary what did i just say
the key is the level okay okay all right

180
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
the key is the level okay okay all right
 

181
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,670
the key is the level okay okay all right
can you pay attention not just

182
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
can you pay attention not just
 

183
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,030
can you pay attention not just
okay so what's your iphone here the key

184
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
okay so what's your iphone here the key
 

185
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,469
okay so what's your iphone here the key
what's the key and then press equal what

186
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
what's the key and then press equal what
 

187
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,590
what's the key and then press equal what
plus plus equal what

188
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
plus plus equal what
 

189
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,870
plus plus equal what
huh what's the key here the key

190
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
huh what's the key here the key
 

191
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,070
huh what's the key here the key
is level level without and then plus

192
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
is level level without and then plus
 

193
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:39,670
is level level without and then plus
plus equals

194
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680

 

195
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,790

this is the left tree recursively so can

196
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
this is the left tree recursively so can
 

197
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,550
this is the left tree recursively so can
you tell me what's dfs

198
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
you tell me what's dfs
 

199
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,950
you tell me what's dfs
here passing what passing which is

200
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
here passing what passing which is
 

201
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,390
here passing what passing which is
really

202
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
really
 

203
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,590
really
where what valley dfs we want to visit

204
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
where what valley dfs we want to visit
 

205
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,310
where what valley dfs we want to visit
the left tree

206
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
the left tree
 

207
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,430
the left tree
so what's this left tree is

208
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
so what's this left tree is
 

209
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,340
so what's this left tree is
dot

210
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,350

[Music]
 

213
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,230
[Music]
okay i know what's level value what's

214
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
okay i know what's level value what's
 

215
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,950
okay i know what's level value what's
the level really

216
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
the level really
 

217
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,189
the level really
we go down and then what's what happened

218
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
we go down and then what's what happened
 

219
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,070
we go down and then what's what happened
to the level value

220
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
to the level value
 

221
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,870
to the level value
the level

222
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880

 

223
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,870

yeah the left current is level and we go

224
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
yeah the left current is level and we go
 

225
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,270
yeah the left current is level and we go
down one note so what happened to the

226
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
down one note so what happened to the
 

227
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,029
down one note so what happened to the
level

228
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
level
 

229
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,830
level
what the what happened level yeah

230
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840
what the what happened level yeah
 

231
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:31,029
what the what happened level yeah
wow

232
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039

 

233
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,469

and then what's what should i do

234
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
and then what's what should i do
 

235
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,230
and then what's what should i do
visiting the right tree can you can you

236
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
visiting the right tree can you can you
 

237
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,909
visiting the right tree can you can you
do this

238
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
do this
 

239
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,110
do this
we don't write yeah

240
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
we don't write yeah
 

241
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,550
we don't write yeah
level one yeah

242
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
level one yeah
 

243
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,310
level one yeah
okay okay so look this is

244
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
okay okay so look this is
 

245
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,350
okay okay so look this is
definitely simple yeah that's it so when

246
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
definitely simple yeah that's it so when
 

247
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,110
definitely simple yeah that's it so when
i call this i just need to call

248
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
i call this i just need to call
 

249
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,070
i call this i just need to call
therefore search look before that i need

250
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
therefore search look before that i need
 

251
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,390
therefore search look before that i need
to

252
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
to
 

253
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,510
to
create a look this is the root and the

254
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
create a look this is the root and the
 

255
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:57,990
create a look this is the root and the
value

256
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
value
 

257
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,230
value
i'm passing at the beginning is zero

258
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
i'm passing at the beginning is zero
 

259
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,270
i'm passing at the beginning is zero
yeah and the sum

260
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
yeah and the sum
 

261
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,230
yeah and the sum
look this sums all right this is the

262
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
look this sums all right this is the
 

263
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,230
look this sums all right this is the
function yes

264
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
function yes
 

265
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,110
function yes
i need to do this before before

266
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
i need to do this before before
 

267
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,150
i need to do this before before
dictionary and in

268
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
dictionary and in
 

269
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,189
dictionary and in
okay then they'll create a dictionary

270
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
okay then they'll create a dictionary
 

271
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,110
okay then they'll create a dictionary
with the integer by default okay and

272
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
with the integer by default okay and
 

273
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,590
with the integer by default okay and
then

274
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
then
 

275
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,670
then
i just need to do this depth test route

276
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
i just need to do this depth test route
 

277
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,749
i just need to do this depth test route
what should i pass with the level and

278
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
what should i pass with the level and
 

279
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,950
what should i pass with the level and
then sums

280
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
then sums
 

281
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,590
then sums
at the beginning what's the level the

282
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
at the beginning what's the level the
 

283
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,230
at the beginning what's the level the
level

284
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
level
 

285
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,390
level
is what's the level

286
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400

 

287
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,070

so you will look you will recursively

288
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
so you will look you will recursively
 

289
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,830
so you will look you will recursively
call this if you notice now

290
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
call this if you notice now
 

291
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,990
call this if you notice now
then just return otherwise i would at

292
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
then just return otherwise i would at
 

293
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,590
then just return otherwise i would at
the level

294
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
the level
 

295
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,629
the level
look the first time the dictionaries

296
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
look the first time the dictionaries
 

297
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,950
look the first time the dictionaries
is empty alright look the decision is

298
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
is empty alright look the decision is
 

299
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,309
is empty alright look the decision is
empty and then

300
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
empty and then
 

301
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,309
empty and then
by default because we are using this

302
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
by default because we are using this
 

303
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,589
by default because we are using this
before dictionary in

304
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
before dictionary in
 

305
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,670
before dictionary in
it means that by default if the key is

306
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
it means that by default if the key is
 

307
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,670
it means that by default if the key is
not existing in the dictionary the value

308
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
not existing in the dictionary the value
 

309
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,870
not existing in the dictionary the value
will be zero

310
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
will be zero
 

311
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,589
will be zero
if look if you're not using the default

312
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
if look if you're not using the default
 

313
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,390
if look if you're not using the default
dictionary

314
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
dictionary
 

315
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,790
dictionary
if you're using this this simple curly

316
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
if you're using this this simple curly
 

317
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,230
if you're using this this simple curly
brace what happened

318
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
brace what happened
 

319
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,309
brace what happened
if because there's no items in the

320
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
if because there's no items in the
 

321
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,070
if because there's no items in the
dictionary if you reference it it will

322
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
dictionary if you reference it it will
 

323
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,430
dictionary if you reference it it will
be a problem because

324
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
be a problem because
 

325
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,790
be a problem because
there's no such item in the dictionary

326
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
there's no such item in the dictionary
 

327
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,550
there's no such item in the dictionary
that's why we use the default dictionary

328
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
that's why we use the default dictionary
 

329
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,150
that's why we use the default dictionary
there's a small difference okay

330
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
there's a small difference okay
 

331
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,469
there's a small difference okay
with the default dictionary we specify

332
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
with the default dictionary we specify
 

333
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,670
with the default dictionary we specify
the type

334
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
the type
 

335
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,309
the type
it means that if the key is not existent

336
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
it means that if the key is not existent
 

337
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,990
it means that if the key is not existent
in additionally by default

338
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
in additionally by default
 

339
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,550
in additionally by default
we mean it's zero so at the beginning

340
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
we mean it's zero so at the beginning
 

341
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,510
we mean it's zero so at the beginning
the sum

342
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
the sum
 

343
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,230
the sum
of the level zero is zero and plus equal

344
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
of the level zero is zero and plus equal
 

345
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,350
of the level zero is zero and plus equal
to the value right

346
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
to the value right
 

347
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,510
to the value right
then you will accumulate right and on

348
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
then you will accumulate right and on
 

349
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,909
then you will accumulate right and on
recursively you go to the left tree

350
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
recursively you go to the left tree
 

351
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,830
recursively you go to the left tree
which is the level plus one and go to

352
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
which is the level plus one and go to
 

353
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,270
which is the level plus one and go to
the right tree which is the

354
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
the right tree which is the
 

355
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,790
the right tree which is the
level password and eric the difference

356
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
level password and eric the difference
 

357
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,990
level password and eric the difference
says actually because

358
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
says actually because
 

359
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,230
says actually because
here we are traversing the binary tree

360
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
here we are traversing the binary tree
 

361
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,070
here we are traversing the binary tree
in o n right the what's the time

362
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
in o n right the what's the time
 

363
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,150
in o n right the what's the time
complexity by the way

364
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
complexity by the way
 

365
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,150
complexity by the way
what's n the number of nodes yeah same

366
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
what's n the number of nodes yeah same
 

367
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,589
what's n the number of nodes yeah same
as yesterday yeah yeah

368
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
as yesterday yeah yeah
 

369
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,670
as yesterday yeah yeah
yeah yeah okay so look

370
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
yeah yeah okay so look
 

371
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,469
yeah yeah okay so look
one question yeah so does the other

372
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
one question yeah so does the other
 

373
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,710
one question yeah so does the other
matter here

374
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
matter here
 

375
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,309
matter here
that's the other matter here don't don't

376
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
that's the other matter here don't don't
 

377
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,790
that's the other matter here don't don't
 maybe or maybe not

378
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
maybe or maybe not
 

379
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,110
maybe or maybe not
there's no other matter here if we need

380
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
there's no other matter here if we need
 

381
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,629
there's no other matter here if we need
it in the tree all right

382
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
it in the tree all right
 

383
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,550
it in the tree all right
is it okay if i visit the right tree

384
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
is it okay if i visit the right tree
 

385
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,670
is it okay if i visit the right tree
first

386
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
first
 

387
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,550
first
but it doesn't have to be left three

388
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
but it doesn't have to be left three
 

389
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,350
but it doesn't have to be left three
maybe

390
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
maybe
 

391
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,629
maybe
or maybe not look the task here is we

392
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
or maybe not look the task here is we
 

393
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,550
or maybe not look the task here is we
are traversing the tree

394
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
are traversing the tree
 

395
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,510
are traversing the tree
and then we update the notes after the

396
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
and then we update the notes after the
 

397
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,230
and then we update the notes after the
decision

398
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
decision
 

399
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,269
decision
with the with with the correct

400
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
with the with with the correct
 

401
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,389
with the with with the correct
correct sum yeah so does it matter if i

402
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
correct sum yeah so does it matter if i
 

403
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,310
correct sum yeah so does it matter if i
i do list first is it okay if i do this

404
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
i do list first is it okay if i do this
 

405
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,190
i do list first is it okay if i do this
first

406
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
first
 

407
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,269
first
for example i this three left look i

408
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
for example i this three left look i
 

409
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,550
for example i this three left look i
like one two

410
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
like one two
 

411
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,910
like one two
three these three line

412
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
three these three line
 

413
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,389
three these three line
does it have to follow this order or can

414
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:50,399
does it have to follow this order or can
 

415
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:50,949
does it have to follow this order or can
it be

416
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
it be
 

417
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,030
it be
any older yes or no

418
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040

 

419
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,790

yes or no does it have to be this order

420
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
yes or no does it have to be this order
 

421
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,590
yes or no does it have to be this order
can that be

422
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
can that be
 

423
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,590
can that be
one three two or two one three or two

424
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
one three two or two one three or two
 

425
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,790
one three two or two one three or two
three one there there are

426
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
three one there there are
 

427
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,430
three one there there are
six permutations right yeah that's the

428
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
six permutations right yeah that's the
 

429
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,430
six permutations right yeah that's the
element sixth permutation all right

430
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
element sixth permutation all right
 

431
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,350
element sixth permutation all right
so does it have to be this way

432
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360

 

433
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,990

if i swap two and three will happen i

434
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
if i swap two and three will happen i
 

435
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,110
if i swap two and three will happen i
visit the right tree

436
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
visit the right tree
 

437
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,829
visit the right tree
first and then visible tree yeah and

438
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
first and then visible tree yeah and
 

439
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,310
first and then visible tree yeah and
then

440
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
then
 

441
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,430
then
does it still work yeah yeah yeah it

442
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
does it still work yeah yeah yeah it
 

443
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,269
does it still work yeah yeah yeah it
still works be confident it still works

444
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
still works be confident it still works
 

445
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,790
still works be confident it still works
it's just the way different

446
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
it's just the way different
 

447
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,949
it's just the way different
the purpose of this function because the

448
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
the purpose of this function because the
 

449
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,870
the purpose of this function because the
function is to

450
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
function is to
 

451
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,430
function is to
update is the most important thing is

452
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
update is the most important thing is
 

453
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,949
update is the most important thing is
this one right it doesn't matter when

454
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
this one right it doesn't matter when
 

455
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,310
this one right it doesn't matter when
you do it you will do it

456
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
you do it you will do it
 

457
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,310
you do it you will do it
you'll be impressed you'll be exclusive

458
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
you'll be impressed you'll be exclusive
 

459
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,070
you'll be impressed you'll be exclusive
this line of code will be executed

460
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
this line of code will be executed
 

461
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,190
this line of code will be executed
anyway right so it's like adding

462
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
anyway right so it's like adding
 

463
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,190
anyway right so it's like adding
the root of value to lesson right it's

464
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,200
the root of value to lesson right it's
 

465
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,550
the root of value to lesson right it's
like a notebook

466
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
like a notebook
 

467
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,509
like a notebook
yeah key with level and value is the sum

468
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
yeah key with level and value is the sum
 

469
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,550
yeah key with level and value is the sum
okay does it make sense

470
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
okay does it make sense
 

471
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,550
okay does it make sense
yeah okay after this look after this we

472
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
yeah okay after this look after this we
 

473
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:54,949
yeah okay after this look after this we
have

474
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
have
 

475
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,150
have
this sum which has the key which is the

476
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
this sum which has the key which is the
 

477
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,710
this sum which has the key which is the
level

478
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
level
 

479
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,190
level
with the different value and how are we

480
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
with the different value and how are we
 

481
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,710
with the different value and how are we
getting the maximum

482
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
getting the maximum
 

483
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,069
getting the maximum
level for that key do you remember

484
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
level for that key do you remember
 

485
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,230
level for that key do you remember
yesterday i'll erase all these yeah

486
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
yesterday i'll erase all these yeah
 

487
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,069
yesterday i'll erase all these yeah
all right look okay all right

488
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
all right look okay all right
 

489
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,190
all right look okay all right
sums like you'll be

490
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
sums like you'll be
 

491
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,190
sums like you'll be
something like that okay additionally

492
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
something like that okay additionally
 

493
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,350
something like that okay additionally
okay let's say level 0 with some

494
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
okay let's say level 0 with some
 

495
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,470
okay let's say level 0 with some
30 level 1 with the sum

496
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
30 level 1 with the sum
 

497
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,710
30 level 1 with the sum
40 and level 2 with the sum 10

498
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
40 and level 2 with the sum 10
 

499
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,310
40 and level 2 with the sum 10
so i want to return level 1

500
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
so i want to return level 1
 

501
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,870
so i want to return level 1
because level 1 has the largest sum 30

502
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
because level 1 has the largest sum 30
 

503
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,509
because level 1 has the largest sum 30
right

504
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
right
 

505
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,990
right
0 1 2 is the key 30 40 10 is the value

506
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
0 1 2 is the key 30 40 10 is the value
 

507
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,310
0 1 2 is the key 30 40 10 is the value
a sums is the dictionary key value pair

508
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
a sums is the dictionary key value pair
 

509
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,990
a sums is the dictionary key value pair
which is the notebook right

510
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
which is the notebook right
 

511
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,630
which is the notebook right
yeah okay so how do we return this one

512
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
yeah okay so how do we return this one
 

513
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,550
yeah okay so how do we return this one
remember yesterday

514
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
remember yesterday
 

515
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,630
remember yesterday
there are two ways one way is that you

516
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
there are two ways one way is that you
 

517
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,910
there are two ways one way is that you
can do this max

518
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
can do this max
 

519
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,430
can do this max
you can get this all right max

520
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
you can get this all right max
 

521
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,230
you can get this all right max
this is the values yeah when you do this

522
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
this is the values yeah when you do this
 

523
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,949
this is the values yeah when you do this
sums

524
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
sums
 

525
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,269
sums
dot values what does it mean what what

526
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
dot values what does it mean what what
 

527
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,949
dot values what does it mean what what
does it mean

528
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
does it mean
 

529
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,230
does it mean
some stock value you will turn this into

530
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
some stock value you will turn this into
 

531
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,710
some stock value you will turn this into
a

532
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
a
 

533
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,470
a
at least which is what 30

534
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
at least which is what 30
 

535
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,750
at least which is what 30
40 10 right yeah this next

536
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
40 10 right yeah this next
 

537
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,949
40 10 right yeah this next
and how about some keys can you tell me

538
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
and how about some keys can you tell me
 

539
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,550
and how about some keys can you tell me
what does it return um

540
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
what does it return um
 

541
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,710
what does it return um
what's key what's that

542
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720

 

543
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,750

zero one two we're done okay so look

544
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
zero one two we're done okay so look
 

545
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,509
zero one two we're done okay so look
some of the value is this and then if i

546
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
some of the value is this and then if i
 

547
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,350
some of the value is this and then if i
do the max of this

548
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
do the max of this
 

549
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,430
do the max of this
so what does it mean it will give me 40

550
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
so what does it mean it will give me 40
 

551
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,269
so what does it mean it will give me 40
right yes

552
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
right yes
 

553
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,389
right yes
and then i can fall the key

554
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
and then i can fall the key
 

555
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,550
and then i can fall the key
in sums then if key if the sums key

556
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
in sums then if key if the sums key
 

557
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,509
in sums then if key if the sums key
equals this 40 then i return the key

558
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
equals this 40 then i return the key
 

559
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,030
equals this 40 then i return the key
right this is what i am doing but

560
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
right this is what i am doing but
 

561
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,069
right this is what i am doing but
another way

562
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
another way
 

563
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,150
another way
more easy is what max you do this

564
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
more easy is what max you do this
 

565
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,269
more easy is what max you do this
max yeah look you can't do this maximum

566
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
max yeah look you can't do this maximum
 

567
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,670
max yeah look you can't do this maximum
because what happens maximum you will

568
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
because what happens maximum you will
 

569
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,829
because what happens maximum you will
return the maximum of the keys

570
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
return the maximum of the keys
 

571
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,870
return the maximum of the keys
this is by default right which is two

572
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
this is by default right which is two
 

573
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,790
this is by default right which is two
which is no we want we want the number

574
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
which is no we want we want the number
 

575
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,790
which is no we want we want the number
one right because number one is

576
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
one right because number one is
 

577
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,990
one right because number one is
very right and if we do the max sum the

578
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
very right and if we do the max sum the
 

579
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,949
very right and if we do the max sum the
values

580
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
values
 

581
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,069
values
will return 40 but i only return one

582
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
will return 40 but i only return one
 

583
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:12,949
will return 40 but i only return one
right

584
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
right
 

585
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,269
right
that doesn't make sense so how do we do

586
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
that doesn't make sense so how do we do
 

587
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,150
that doesn't make sense so how do we do
this we can do this max

588
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
this we can do this max
 

589
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,269
this we can do this max

do this yellow which is the key if the
 

621
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,389
do this yellow which is the key if the

one is the 40 all right
 

623
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,829

does it make sense so after this we can
 

625
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,190
does it make sense so after this we can
can compute the maximum level

come on this sum the item is this one
will return because i specify the key

650
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
will return because i specify the key
 

651
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,269
will return because i specify the key
which is the

which is the
 

653
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,269
which is the
value i want to get the largest value

654
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
value i want to get the largest value
 

655
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,670

which is by salted by this 40 yeah

656
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
which is by salted by this 40 yeah
 

657
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,790
which is by salted by this 40 yeah
yeah so this this whole thing

658
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
yeah so this this whole thing
 

659
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,269
yeah so this this whole thing
this whole thing is 140 it's a 2 per 140

660
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:11,279
this whole thing is 140 it's a 2 per 140
 

661
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,430
this whole thing is 140 it's a 2 per 140
item so if 0 is it's 1 and how about if

662
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
item so if 0 is it's 1 and how about if
 

663
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,150

and of oh and also we are using the

682
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
and of oh and also we are using the
 

683
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,590
and of oh and also we are using the
recursion

684
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
recursion
 

685
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,629

because you have normally has us

because you have normally has us
 

687
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,350

as a stack you know if we are doing

recursion
 

691
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,150

it means that usually there will be a
