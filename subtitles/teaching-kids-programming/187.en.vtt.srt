00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
is not right and we we want to check
 

51
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,870
is not right and we we want to check
when you were just saying it yeah i hear

52
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
when you were just saying it yeah i hear
 

53
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,870
when you were just saying it yeah i hear
the beginning with w so i don't need

54
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
the beginning with w so i don't need
 

55
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,469
the beginning with w so i don't need
stuff from w

56
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479

 

57
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,710

okay so what's the any thoughts how we

58
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
okay so what's the any thoughts how we
 

59
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,870
okay so what's the any thoughts how we
tackle this program how are we going to

60
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
tackle this program how are we going to
 

61
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,830
tackle this program how are we going to
solve this problem yeah oh we're going

62
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
solve this problem yeah oh we're going
 

63
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,590
solve this problem yeah oh we're going
to solve this problem

64
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600

 

65
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,670

what does it mean what does it mean how

66
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
what does it mean what does it mean how
 

67
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,510
what does it mean what does it mean how
we solving this problem

68
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520

 

69
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,510

eric any idea how we solving this

70
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
eric any idea how we solving this
 

71
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,270
eric any idea how we solving this
problem

72
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280

 

73
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,469

ryan how are we solving this problem

74
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
ryan how are we solving this problem
 

75
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:17,990
ryan how are we solving this problem
so

76
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000

 

77
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,470

this one this one is not the same look n

78
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
this one this one is not the same look n
 

79
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:28,309
this one this one is not the same look n
and i

80
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319

 

81
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,309

okay so your approach is checking

82
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
okay so your approach is checking
 

83
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,630
okay so your approach is checking
characters by characters and right

84
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
characters by characters and right
 

85
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,630
characters by characters and right
and here we found out this mismatch yeah

86
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
and here we found out this mismatch yeah
 

87
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,589
and here we found out this mismatch yeah
right yeah so how many characters are we

88
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
right yeah so how many characters are we
 

89
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,150
right yeah so how many characters are we
need to

90
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
need to
 

91
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,309
need to
checking how many characters do we need

92
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
checking how many characters do we need
 

93
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,110
checking how many characters do we need
to check

94
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
to check
 

95
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,869
to check
all of them oh man are you sure look

96
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
all of them oh man are you sure look
 

97
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,550
all of them oh man are you sure look
this is the shortest one

98
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
this is the shortest one
 

99
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,350
this is the shortest one
do we need to check four three yeah the

100
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
do we need to check four three yeah the
 

101
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,550
do we need to check four three yeah the
minimum right

102
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
minimum right
 

103
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,470
minimum right
because there's no point to check four

104
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
because there's no point to check four
 

105
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,550
because there's no point to check four
characters the first one only has

106
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
characters the first one only has
 

107
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,949
characters the first one only has
three characters so the first of all we

108
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
three characters so the first of all we
 

109
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,149
three characters so the first of all we
need to check the

110
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
need to check the
 

111
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,030
need to check the
shortest to kill the shorties right yeah

112
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
shortest to kill the shorties right yeah
 

113
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,589
shortest to kill the shorties right yeah
yeah

114
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
yeah
 

115
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,630
yeah
yeah yeah yeah ryan right

116
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
yeah yeah yeah ryan right
 

117
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,309
yeah yeah yeah ryan right
and then we go through these characters

118
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
and then we go through these characters
 

119
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,229
and then we go through these characters
by character kung fu

120
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
by character kung fu
 

121
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,309
by character kung fu
okay okay that's it so let's let's

122
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
okay okay that's it so let's let's
 

123
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,830
okay okay that's it so let's let's
implement this

124
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
implement this
 

125
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:28,390
implement this
okay

126
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400

 

127
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,390

this word is a list of strings

128
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400

 

129
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,949

so at the beginning what we need to do

130
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
so at the beginning what we need to do
 

131
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,190
so at the beginning what we need to do
is to find out the shortest

132
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
is to find out the shortest
 

133
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,869
is to find out the shortest
person yeah the shortest first shortest

134
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
person yeah the shortest first shortest
 

135
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,589
person yeah the shortest first shortest
the shortest length of all the strings

136
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
the shortest length of all the strings
 

137
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,270
the shortest length of all the strings
in the list right

138
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
in the list right
 

139
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,350
in the list right
and yeah right look so let's say

140
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
and yeah right look so let's say
 

141
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,789
and yeah right look so let's say
this k the shortest length is k

142
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
this k the shortest length is k
 

143
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,509
this k the shortest length is k
and k let's say is equals to the very

144
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
and k let's say is equals to the very
 

145
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,470
and k let's say is equals to the very
big

146
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
big
 

147
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,670
big
big number with net stock infinity and

148
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
big number with net stock infinity and
 

149
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,030
big number with net stock infinity and
for w in one word

150
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
for w in one word
 

151
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,110
for w in one word
in what and k equals one

152
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
in what and k equals one
 

153
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,149
in what and k equals one
k equals we want to

154
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
k equals we want to
 

155
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,630
k equals we want to
update the shortest one right yeah so

156
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
update the shortest one right yeah so
 

157
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,670
update the shortest one right yeah so
what's the

158
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
what's the
 

159
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,349
what's the
mean right okay okay of what what's the

160
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
mean right okay okay of what what's the
 

161
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,430
mean right okay okay of what what's the
length of the word

162
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
length of the word
 

163
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,670
length of the word
i word lens of dublin

164
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
i word lens of dublin
 

165
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,350

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
yeah all right okay so
 

167
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,390
yeah all right okay so
look these three lines we can turn into

168
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
look these three lines we can turn into
 

169
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,510
look these three lines we can turn into
one line

170
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
one line
 

171
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,749
one line
which is k equals

172
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
which is k equals
 

173
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,629
which is k equals
mean of length lens

174
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
mean of length lens
 

175
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,670
mean of length lens
i know what what should we do four

176
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
i know what what should we do four
 

177
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,430
i know what what should we do four
four w in words well done

178
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
four w in words well done
 

179
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,230
four w in words well done
okay so that's just one man okay this is

180
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
okay so that's just one man okay this is
 

181
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,990
okay so that's just one man okay this is
one note okay i don't have space here

182
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
one note okay i don't have space here
 

183
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,710
one note okay i don't have space here
so k equals infinity the very very big

184
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
so k equals infinity the very very big
 

185
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,230
so k equals infinity the very very big
number and i try to

186
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
number and i try to
 

187
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,510
number and i try to
iterate all the string in the words

188
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
iterate all the string in the words
 

189
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,510
iterate all the string in the words
and then for each string of words i want

190
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
and then for each string of words i want
 

191
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,550
and then for each string of words i want
to get the length of each word

192
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
to get the length of each word
 

193
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,430
to get the length of each word
and then update to locate hey after that

194
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
and then update to locate hey after that
 

195
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,150
and then update to locate hey after that
k will be

196
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
k will be
 

197
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,070
k will be
equal to three for the one yeah

198
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080

 

199
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,670

and then now what do we do next what

200
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
and then now what do we do next what
 

201
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,749
and then now what do we do next what
should we do next

202
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
should we do next
 

203
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,029
should we do next
we shall we should do what we

204
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
we shall we should do what we
 

205
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:32,390
we shall we should do what we
let's say i i equals

206
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400

 

207
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,310

okay so let's say we have three three

208
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
okay so let's say we have three three
 

209
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,830
okay so let's say we have three three
strings so i

210
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
strings so i
 

211
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,670
strings so i
at the beginning points to the first

212
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
at the beginning points to the first
 

213
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,629
at the beginning points to the first
character which is i equals zero

214
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
character which is i equals zero
 

215
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,830
character which is i equals zero
and then if if all these are the same

216
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
and then if if all these are the same
 

217
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,430
and then if if all these are the same
it's all the same and we point to the

218
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
it's all the same and we point to the
 

219
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,270
it's all the same and we point to the
next one we want to check oh oh

220
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
next one we want to check oh oh
 

221
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,390
next one we want to check oh oh
it's not same and and and r is not the

222
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
it's not same and and and r is not the
 

223
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,469
it's not same and and and r is not the
same then we break then we return

224
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
same then we break then we return
 

225
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,749
same then we break then we return
the first two letters right wa yeah

226
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
the first two letters right wa yeah
 

227
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,629
the first two letters right wa yeah
okay so now i need to i start from the

228
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
okay so now i need to i start from the
 

229
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,350
okay so now i need to i start from the
first one and

230
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
first one and
 

231
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,550
first one and
why excuse me okay

232
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
why excuse me okay
 

233
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:12,550
why excuse me okay
why why what why

234
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560

 

235
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,510

is smaller than k yeah because k is the

236
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
is smaller than k yeah because k is the
 

237
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,110
is smaller than k yeah because k is the
minimum which is three yeah

238
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
minimum which is three yeah
 

239
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,510
minimum which is three yeah
there's no point to checking beyond the

240
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
there's no point to checking beyond the
 

241
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,110
there's no point to checking beyond the
chase character right

242
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
chase character right
 

243
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,150
chase character right
color and now look if we want to find

244
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
color and now look if we want to find
 

245
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,629
color and now look if we want to find
out

246
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
out
 

247
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,749
out
if these all the characters

248
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
if these all the characters
 

249
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,309
if these all the characters
at index i is the same we can use the

250
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
at index i is the same we can use the
 

251
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:30,790
at index i is the same we can use the
set

252
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
set
 

253
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,950
set
which is that set is the data structure

254
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
which is that set is the data structure
 

255
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,230
which is that set is the data structure
only stores

256
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
only stores
 

257
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,350
only stores
unique numbers unique characters yeah

258
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
unique numbers unique characters yeah
 

259
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,710
unique numbers unique characters yeah
if you put two ryans in a set there's

260
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
if you put two ryans in a set there's
 

261
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,230
if you put two ryans in a set there's
only one lion

262
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
only one lion
 

263
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,270
only one lion
that's me if you put the ryan and eric

264
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
that's me if you put the ryan and eric
 

265
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,790
that's me if you put the ryan and eric
in a set there will be two elements

266
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
in a set there will be two elements
 

267
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,870
in a set there will be two elements
arrogant right if you put a hundred

268
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
arrogant right if you put a hundred
 

269
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,110
arrogant right if you put a hundred
eric's and a hundred lions in the center

270
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
eric's and a hundred lions in the center
 

271
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,670
eric's and a hundred lions in the center
what happened

272
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
what happened
 

273
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,469
what happened
you will only have one ryan on one eric

274
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
you will only have one ryan on one eric
 

275
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:54,790
you will only have one ryan on one eric
because

276
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
because
 

277
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,070
because
the set is kind of hash table uh a

278
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
the set is kind of hash table uh a
 

279
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,430
the set is kind of hash table uh a
notebook but only yeah

280
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
notebook but only yeah
 

281
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,110
notebook but only yeah
only stores the unique elements

282
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
only stores the unique elements
 

283
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,950
only stores the unique elements
so why are we so what what we our idea

284
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
so why are we so what what we our idea
 

285
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,990
so why are we so what what we our idea
is that to to put

286
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
is that to to put
 

287
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,589
is that to to put
all the characters at index i for

288
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
all the characters at index i for
 

289
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,870
all the characters at index i for
words in in the set right and in the

290
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
words in in the set right and in the
 

291
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,790
words in in the set right and in the
event

292
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
event
 

293
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,029
event
yeah if there's only one element in a

294
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
yeah if there's only one element in a
 

295
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,350
yeah if there's only one element in a
cell what does it mean

296
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
cell what does it mean
 

297
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,990
cell what does it mean
what does it mean if there's only one

298
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
what does it mean if there's only one
 

299
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,189
what does it mean if there's only one
every man in us

300
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
every man in us
 

301
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,430
every man in us
in a set what does it mean it means

302
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
in a set what does it mean it means
 

303
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,309
in a set what does it mean it means
that's the prefix that's the character

304
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
that's the prefix that's the character
 

305
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:36,710
that's the prefix that's the character
is

306
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
is
 

307
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,629
is
and that position is also if it's more

308
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
and that position is also if it's more
 

309
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,830
and that position is also if it's more
than one what does it mean

310
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840

 

311
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,550

what does it mean and and ah what does

312
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
what does it mean and and ah what does
 

313

what does it mean and and ah what does
it mean

314
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
it mean
 

315
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,469
it mean
then there will be enema yeah yeah now

316
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
then there will be enema yeah yeah now
 

317
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,270
then there will be enema yeah yeah now
what does it mean

318
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
what does it mean
 

319
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,869
what does it mean
it means it it means you break

320
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
it means it it means you break
 

321
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,309
it means it it means you break
yeah you break it because we found more

322
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
yeah you break it because we found more
 

323
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,909
yeah you break it because we found more
and then you do your previous prefix

324
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
and then you do your previous prefix
 

325
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,189
and then you do your previous prefix
which is w y i know what you mean yeah

326
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
which is w y i know what you mean yeah
 

327
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,830
which is w y i know what you mean yeah
okay c

328
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
okay c
 

329
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,909
okay c
equals set now what

330
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
equals set now what
 

331
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,189
equals set now what
w i because we want to get the ice index

332
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
w i because we want to get the ice index
 

333
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,629
w i because we want to get the ice index
the character index i

334
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
the character index i
 

335
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,309
the character index i
and then 401 for our

336
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
and then 401 for our
 

337
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,350
and then 401 for our
force for w

338
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
force for w
 

339
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,950
force for w
in words

340
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
in words
 

341
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,909
in words
for w inverse okay so this is the same

342
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
for w inverse okay so this is the same
 

343
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,869
for w inverse okay so this is the same
as

344
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
as
 

345
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,950
as
c equals set then for w inverse

346
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
c equals set then for w inverse
 

347
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,870
c equals set then for w inverse
c dot at w i okay you can turn into

348
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
c dot at w i okay you can turn into
 

349
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,870
c dot at w i okay you can turn into
uh three lines like this but we're using

350
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
uh three lines like this but we're using
 

351
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,909
uh three lines like this but we're using
one nine okay

352
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
one nine okay
 

353
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,909
one nine okay
length is length c

354
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
length is length c
 

355
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,750
length is length c
not equals one right yeah because we now

356
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
not equals one right yeah because we now
 

357
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,750
not equals one right yeah because we now
found a more than one character not all

358
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
found a more than one character not all
 

359
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,470
found a more than one character not all
the previous

360
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
the previous
 

361
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,670
the previous
i plus equals one yeah then we check the

362
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
i plus equals one yeah then we check the
 

363
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,710
i plus equals one yeah then we check the
next character and

364
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
next character and
 

365
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,910
next character and
and the last the i i

366
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
and the last the i i
 

367
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,070
and the last the i i
we will break and i equals two right so

368
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
we will break and i equals two right so
 

369
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,190
we will break and i equals two right so
we want to get the

370
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
we want to get the
 

371
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,070
we want to get the
character up to i equals two so return

372
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
character up to i equals two so return
 

373
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,590
character up to i equals two so return
return

374
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
return
 

375
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,790
return
we tell any words because

376
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
we tell any words because
 

377
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,949
we tell any words because
any word what the let's say we can

378
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
any word what the let's say we can
 

379
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,990
any word what the let's say we can
return the

380
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
return the
 

381
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,829
return the
first one zero zero column i

382
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
first one zero zero column i
 

383
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,110
first one zero zero column i
and then column i wait because i is two

384
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
and then column i wait because i is two
 

385
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,030
and then column i wait because i is two
and then we now we want to we take all

386
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
and then we now we want to we take all
 

387
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,670
and then we now we want to we take all
the characters up to two so which is w

388
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
the characters up to two so which is w
 

389
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,670
the characters up to two so which is w
and you can pick any of them for

390
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
and you can pick any of them for
 

391
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,430
and you can pick any of them for
convenience we can put

392
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
convenience we can put
 

393
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,750
convenience we can put
what's i what's zero is this first one

394
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
what's i what's zero is this first one
 

395
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,550
what's i what's zero is this first one
right

396
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
right
 

397
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,470
right
yeah one zero is w o i n

398
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
yeah one zero is w o i n
 

399
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,509
yeah one zero is w o i n
and then you want to column i which is

400
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
and then you want to column i which is
 

401
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,550
and then you want to column i which is
with return w

402
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
with return w
 

403
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,990
with return w
ou all right yeah all right yeah

404
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
ou all right yeah all right yeah
 

405
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,150
ou all right yeah all right yeah
what what's this part let's study what's

406
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
what what's this part let's study what's
 

407
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,470
what what's this part let's study what's
the point this part of complexity time

408
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
the point this part of complexity time
 

409
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,430
the point this part of complexity time
least complex if there are n numbers of

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
least complex if there are n numbers of
 

411
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:47,990
least complex if there are n numbers of

413
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,509
words
in string in the world what's this part

414
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
in string in the world what's this part
 

415
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,110
in string in the world what's this part
complex i went

416
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
complex i went
 

417
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,990
complex i went
where where down this is one yeah this

418
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
where where down this is one yeah this
 

419
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,389
where where down this is one yeah this
is he

420
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
is he
 

421
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,389
is he
got no head ryan eric look

422
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
got no head ryan eric look
 

423
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,670
got no head ryan eric look
and okay

424
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680

 

425
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,350

and what's the what's the time

426
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
and what's the what's the time
 

427
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,949
and what's the what's the time
complexity if

428
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
complexity if
 

429
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,069
complexity if
for this part this bit check the k times

430
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
for this part this bit check the k times
 

431
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:14,710
for this part this bit check the k times
right

432
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
right
 

433
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:25,350
right
yeah then what's this complexity

434
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360

 

435
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,430

because we need to check here characters

436
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
because we need to check here characters
 

437
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,069
because we need to check here characters
and then for this one

438
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
and then for this one
 

439
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,310
and then for this one
for each for this one we need to check

440
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
for each for this one we need to check
 

441
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,590
for each for this one we need to check
we need to iterate

442
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
we need to iterate
 

443
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,030
we need to iterate
and string right so actually okay comes

444
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
and string right so actually okay comes
 

445
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,829
and string right so actually okay comes
n because we need to check check the k

446
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
n because we need to check check the k
 

447
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,870
n because we need to check check the k
strings yeah

448
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
strings yeah
 

449
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,590
strings yeah
and strings right yeah okay yeah i'm

450
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
and strings right yeah okay yeah i'm
 

451
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,710
and strings right yeah okay yeah i'm
making it again

452
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
making it again
 

453
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,509
making it again
okay in okay n so the overall time

454
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
okay in okay n so the overall time
 

455
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,630
okay in okay n so the overall time
convexity is

456
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
convexity is
 

457
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,230
convexity is
o n plus k times m

458
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
o n plus k times m
 

459
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,069
o n plus k times m
okay what's the space complexity

460
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
okay what's the space complexity
 

461
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,190
okay what's the space complexity
i one

462
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
i one
 

463
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,790
i one
we are using a set here come on oh oh n

464
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
we are using a set here come on oh oh n
 

465
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,150
we are using a set here come on oh oh n
o n yeah because this is n right

466
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
o n yeah because this is n right
 

467
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,069
o n yeah because this is n right
and yeah in in uh in the worst case

468
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
and yeah in in uh in the worst case
 

469
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,710
and yeah in in uh in the worst case
maybe

470
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
maybe
 

471
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,949
maybe
in the worst case each character will be

472
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
in the worst case each character will be
 

473
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,069
in the worst case each character will be
different right

474
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
different right
 

475
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,829
different right
maybe maybe they're totally different

476
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
maybe maybe they're totally different
 

477
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,670
maybe maybe they're totally different
like a b c d e f

478
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
like a b c d e f
 

479
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,870
like a b c d e f
right g h i and then o

480
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
right g h i and then o
 

481
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,750
right g h i and then o
you the set will contain three letters a

482
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
you the set will contain three letters a
 

483
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:23,990
you the set will contain three letters a
d

484
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
d
 

485
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,630
d
and g so this is the set and then the

486
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
and g so this is the set and then the
 

487
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,990
and g so this is the set and then the
space complexity is

488
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
space complexity is
 

489
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,670
space complexity is
o-n okay and now we are getting that

490
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
o-n okay and now we are getting that
 

491
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,670
o-n okay and now we are getting that
uh thingy right never give up

492
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
uh thingy right never give up
 

493
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,829
uh thingy right never give up
okay then let's say uh

494
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
okay then let's say uh
 

495
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,870
okay then let's say uh
what what what's here what's here

496
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
what what what's here what's here
 

497
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,069
what what what's here what's here
what's here why wha why oh
