1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,480
hello mister reviews the right night

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,919
right

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,560
yes

4
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,160
what's combination

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,440
we talk about that

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,920
c

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,559
three two three four speaking two apples

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,559
how many ways

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,640
three um three yes

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,600
so one two three yeah picking two

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,920
one two one three two three that's it

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
okay and three one two one

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,400
okay

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,439
three apples picking

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,520
one apple how many ways

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,239
one two when you pick one two you have

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,520
three one quick one two you have two i

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,600
picked two three

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,200
you have one okay we talked about that

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,000
right combination the items without

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,600
orders yeah picking two apples out of

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,160
three we just pick it and we don't need

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,719
to worry about the order of the

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,760
apples but if we want these two apples

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,039
to be

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,879
different

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,559
with the sequence right one two is

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,559
different than two one

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,399
and all we have to do is use this p

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,640
permutation right

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,720
three apples picking two apples but one

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,760
two is different than two one then we

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,799
have two

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,960
times the factorial right you see first

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,720
of all we pick two apples after three

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,720
and then we

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,040
commutate through the floor permutation

38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,479
on two apples

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,200
and we know full permutation of n is n

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,960
factorial the first one we have n choice

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
the second one we have n minus one

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,799
choice the third one we have n minus two

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,640
choice etc till the end so p and n is n

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,560
factor

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,400
okay so this combination we talked about

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,079
this combination a little bit on day 93

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,119
today we're just going to review it and

48
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,479
with a bit extra details so how do we

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,720
calculate c

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,399
m out of n how do you calculate this

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,399
number

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,439
okay so i give you a hint all right so

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,640
we can think of it recursively dynamic

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,799
programming how look i have a

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,960
n apples

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,320
and apples

57
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,479
okay

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,479
and i want to pick m

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,239
okay so let's take a look at this one

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
how many choices do we have for the

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,200
first apple

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,599
how many choices

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,920
yeah what are those uh picky i'm not

64
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,959
picking we're done okay pick it do not

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,730
forget if we pick it how many apples

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,920
left

67
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,160
[Music]

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,040
and minus one yeah

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,280
if we pick it we have n minus one apples

70
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,200
but how many apples we need to pick if

71
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,200
we pick one apples already if we pick

72
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,800
this one how many apples left we need to

73
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,440
pick look and apples

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,599
i know we want to pick m apples pick and

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,280
address

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,480
okay so you say the first level we have

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,640
two choice

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,200
we can pick it or we don't pick it when

79
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,200
we pick it we pick one app off we want

80
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,440
to pick mappers we only pick one apples

81
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,480
how many left

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,879
we have n minus one upper left to pick

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,360
and how many apples we need to pick from

84
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,480
n minus one right because we pick one

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,920
and yeah there are n minus one right

86
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,239
okay

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,319
if we skip it how many hours left

88
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,080
we need to pick stair pm how many of us

89
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,800
we need to pick from look we skipped

90
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,440
this one how many hours here

91
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,640
yeah here only here is n minus one right

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,239
so is c n minus one we want to pick

93
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,959
and where

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,920
c

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:32,480
and m equals c n minus one m plus c n

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,319
minus one and minus one

97
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,519
right this is how we get this uh

98
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,680
recursion relation for the combination

99
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,239
okay let me repeat this we have n r plus

100
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,480
let's look at this first f particularly

101
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,120
if we pick it we need to pick n minus

102
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,239
one more from a minus one of us if we

103
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,440
skip it

104
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,799
we still have an apples to pick right

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,959
and

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,680
12 and minus one letters right

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,360
because you said to choice you can't eat

108
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,599
it you pick it don't skip it you don't

109
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,200
eat it okay there are enables how many

110
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,799
ways to pick another part there are

111
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
three apples how many ways to pick three

112
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,599
apples

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
um

114
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,480
one there are three episodes how many

115
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
ways to pick nothing

116
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,360
yeah one

117
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,680
okay

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,199
we talk about that c and

119
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,800
m equals c and n minus m right

120
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,400
yeah

121
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,400
picking two levels is the same as

122
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,080
picking one up picking one apple is the

123
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,280
same as picking together dnm equals what

124
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,479
is m bigger than n right let's see it

125
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,240
first i want to pick 100 how many ways

126
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,479
what should i put here when m bigger

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,720
than n what's the answer

128
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,000
is it right zero well this is impossible

129
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,759
right yeah

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
zero okay

131
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,680
define

132
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,280
c

133
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,240
and m

134
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,000
if

135
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
m bigger than n

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
return

137
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,800
zero

138
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,680
m equal and n return

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,360
one

140
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,800
right

141
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,400
if

142
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,039
m equal equals zero return

143
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,560
one right we talk about it and otherwise

144
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,440
we tend

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,880
c

146
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,960
n minus one picking m apples plus c

147
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,919
n minus one picking n minus one letter

148
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,600
if we

149
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,840
pick it if we skip it okay we'll talk

150
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,320
about it easy python code what's missing

151
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,560
here okay cash without the cash the time

152
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,320
complexity will be very complex will be

153
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,800
exponential because

154
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,400
these intermediate values are calculated

155
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
over and over again we need to use the

156
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,120
hash table or the cash simply cash to

157
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,440
store the intermediate results okay

158
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,400
this is the dynamic programming top down

159
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,639
dynamic room any questions on this bit

160
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,960
we talk about this on day 93 the

161
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,840
question this is recursion

162
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,639
cnn cash

163
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,639
1-1 what's this

164
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,560
do you still remember it

165
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,880
but this value any value this way

166
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,639
pascal triangle

167
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,960
yeah look this value

168
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,639
is the sum of the value

169
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,919
above right

170
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,919
see this is cn yeah why is it above and

171
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,120
is the triangle this way

172
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,520
if i write it

173
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,520
this way

174
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,280
the number

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,759
is equal to the numbers above it but why

176
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,759
i write it this way

177
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,280
because in computer sense rectangular

178
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,280
let's go ahead and match it

179
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,520
particular term so this is particular

180
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,639
triangle look i want to calculate cnm

181
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,240
here

182
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,039
it's a sum of

183
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,280
c n minus 1 m

184
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,080
c n minus 1 and minus 1.

185
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,160
right any number is equal to the sum of

186
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,039
the numbers above it two numbers above

187
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,319
it

188
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,039
top down

189
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,199
top down we use the top down right cm we

190
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,720
want to calculate c and m

191
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,440
then we need to know c n minus one and

192
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,919
and then c n minus one

193
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,240
and minus one right and again these will

194
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,160
be spun into two

195
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,080
right so we have to

196
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,720
remember the values

197
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,520
right for example somewhere here

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,639
this value could be the same as this one

199
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,599
and then if we spend huge amount of time

200
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,000
in

201
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,120
in spawning the trees here

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,599
there's no point to do it again when we

203
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,759
meet it the next time

204
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,599
so we use the cache

205
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
the other way is use the butter area we

206
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,199
talk about top down this is top down we

207
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,960
want to calculate from the bottom up we

208
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,240
need to use the array to install the

209
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,639
values

210
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,639
this top down is very simple

211
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,720
very easy to understand right

212
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,880
yeah and then the advantage of using

213
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,919
this is that the computer take care of

214
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,080
most details when the n and m is out of

215
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,000
boundary and intended cache we don't

216
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,879
need to particularly tell the computer

217
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,199
how to remember the values it's just

218
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,680
like okay we ask computer to remember

219
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,680
this value when you see it the first

220
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,080
time you remember magic keyword cash

221
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,280
without cash without cash for the up

222
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,479
okay

223
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,280
define

224
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,879
c and m again you know there are three

225
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,680
edge cases where when m is bigger than n

226
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,000
return zero if

227
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,120
m equals equals 0

228
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,199
or

229
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,719
m equal equal n and return 1.

230
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,719
we have to store the value in array

231
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,440
let's say dt array

232
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,279
dp equals at the beginning we store it

233
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,000
as a 0

234
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,680
times look at the values here has a

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,519
triangle

236
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,720
so this is

237
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,360
n rows

238
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,519
here we want to have uh m columns we

239
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,839
need to create a two dimensional array

240
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,880
times

241
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,839
m for

242
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,800
underscore in range

243
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,959
and

244
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,560
look these values we know we don't need

245
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,440
to calculate this is the boundary value

246
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,560
this is the boundary value right for

247
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,800
i in range look at that let's say this

248
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,600
is the first one is the zero and then

249
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,040
the last one is n so actually this is m

250
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,880
plus one

251
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,320
and m plus one

252
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,360
the row number from zero to n plus one

253
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,839
so we going to prefer this column which

254
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,680
is dp

255
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,480
i 0 equals 1

256
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,120
right

257
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,800
on this value we need to do it

258
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,680
as well so for

259
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,040
i

260
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,519
in

261
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,519
range

262
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,440
and n plus one

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,920
right

264
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,279
so d p

265
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,240
i

266
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,320
i

267
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,519
equals one so we are feeding these

268
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,320
values

269
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,880
and then we need to calculate for i in

270
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,680
range from second actually to n plus one

271
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,480
for

272
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,240
j

273
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,360
in range

274
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,800
second column to i but this i could be

275
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,959
bigger than the m so we have to get a

276
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,320
minimum i

277
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,360
and then

278
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,560
m

279
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,079
d p

280
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,320
i j

281
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,760
equals d p i minus one okay i minus one

282
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
j

283
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,200
plus d p

284
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,560
i minus one

285
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,399
j minus one

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,760
and we ten

287
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,560
d p

288
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,560
minus one minus one

289
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,399
minus one the index minus one is the

290
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,079
last variable so basically this is the

291
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,079
same as dp and m

292
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,040
we need to fill the triangles each

293
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,560
number is the sum of the two numbers

294
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,440
above it

295
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,839
right this is the way it is

296
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,720
so the j the inner loop the index will

297
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,800
be going from one to the n but not

298
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,959
including this one this one is one right

299
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,120
so which we have

300
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,920
completed yeah

301
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,079
okay so as you can see if we write it in

302
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,760
butter out it'd be non-trivial so it's

303
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,920
difficult to get it right because of the

304
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,800
boundaries because we are feeling this

305
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,560
metric ourselves but using the top down

306
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,399
we don't have to worry about details we

307
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,839
don't need to worry about where to store

308
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,200
the values

309
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,959
here we store the value in the

310
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,959
two-dimensional array

311
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,720
but in the previous version where do the

312
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,320
values stop we don't care

313
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,560
we just asked the computer to store it

314
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,000
using the cache

315
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,360
the computer just stole the cache

316
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,959
somewhere right start the value

317
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,959
somewhere but here we are telling the

318
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,920
computer we want to store the value in

319
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,240
here

320
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,800
then we have to do it ourselves

321
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,480
but the advantage of this one is that

322
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,480
it's practically speaking the

323
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,640
implementation is a bit faster because

324
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,440
there is no function call remember

325
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,839
previous one the top down we have the

326
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,800
recursion calling itself right calling

327
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,120
itself but here we're just calculating

328
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,519
the pascal triangle from the top to the

329
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,839
bottom when we calculate this value the

330
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,320
two values are already calculated above

331
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,680
it right look when we calculate this

332
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,279
value six

333
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,320
we calculate this value which is three

334
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,399
plus three

335
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,519
these two values are already known we

336
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,200
don't need to

337
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,200
go through from the top to the bottom

338
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,320
too in order to get these two values all

339
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,930
right because we already store it here

340
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,240
yes

341
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,720
[Music]

342
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,800
this value is only based on the two

343
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,920
values above it right

344
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,880
there's no

345
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,639
point to store these values we don't

346
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,200
need it right we can just use the one

347
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,120
dimensional array am right look every

348
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,720
time i calculate the value one value in

349
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,360
a two pascal triangle i only need two

350
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,600
values right this value at least ready

351
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,240
any value i don't only need two values i

352
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,639
don't need the values prior to it

353
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,800
let me select i don't need to store it

354
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,519
so in order to do this we can have a one

355
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,920
dimensional array which is this this pip

356
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,440
and then one and every time we calculate

357
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,680
it backwards

358
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,399
so this is the same but with the dp we

359
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,959
just have to change it dp equals at the

360
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,360
beginning the first value 1 plus

361
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,000
0 times

362
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,000
times m

363
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,160
and then for

364
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:17,040
i in range how many rows is it so

365
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,399
they are n rows how many times i have to

366
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,480
iterate so n plus one here

367
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,279
and then d p

368
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,639
i

369
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,720
would be one

370
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,680
this is setting the right boundary so

371
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,440
remember the first triangle one one one

372
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,040
one one one one one this dpi is setting

373
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,880
these

374
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,839
for j in range

375
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,240
i minus 1 till 0

376
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,959
minus 1 so i go from

377
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,480
i

378
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,440
backwards

379
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,399
then dp j plus equals dp j minus one so

380
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,720
this is basically say dpi minus one j

381
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,480
plus dpi minus one three minus one and

382
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,680
then we turn

383
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
pp

384
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,720
the last value which is the same as tpm

385
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,639
the space we only use one dimensional

386
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,279
array and here we're using the two

387
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,360
dimensional array which one is better

388
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,720
here this array we only use in one

389
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,560
dimensional array

390
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,800
this two-dimensional array the space

391
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,880
complexity here is om the space

392
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,040
complexity here is o

393
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,959
m times n so which one is better which

394
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,920
one is better yeah this one is better

395
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,440
the time complexity both the same right

396
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,199
there are two roots

397
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,920
two loops o n times m okay

398
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,560
so this is the most uh optimum solution

399
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,000
in terms of time and space

400
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,440
okay so what have you learned today

401
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,839
combination

402
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,040
more detail yeah combination

403
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,600
combination on day 93 we talked about

404
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,240
this combination actually this is a bit

405
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,639
more detailed here right we using the

406
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,079
bottom up these two are the previous one

407
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,000
is top down

408
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,480
with the cash recursion with the

409
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,680
minimization remember and then the

410
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,120
formula

411
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,000
c and m equals n factorial divided by n

412
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,959
factorial divided by n minus m factorial

413
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,079
right

414
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,399
okay

415
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,720
okay that's it for today bye-bye

416
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,720
bye bye
