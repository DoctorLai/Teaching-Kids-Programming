1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
hello

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,040
hello mr mr ryan all right

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,279
yes

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,920
okay so wait oh look this is cool yeah

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,960
so look there's her head there if i saw

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,040
it

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,799
okay i saw it what's the

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,279
probability of the

9
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,400
facing up 50 percent and another 50

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,920
percent

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,680
they both

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,439
have electric signs on them

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,519
okay but this is tail this is the head

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,880
okay let's say okay 50 percent facing up

15
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,800
50 facing down right yeah if i have two

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,079
coins

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,120
50 facing up each if i throw the coin

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,000
each coin

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,370
once what's the probability of i have

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,710
two coins or both facing up

21
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,710
[Music]

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,039
yeah so let's

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,039
come on yeah

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,280
that will give us

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,280
okay

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,320
half is 50 the same thing yeah one over

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,360
two

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,760
huh

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,880
okay i got 25

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,320
yeah this is 25 exactly yeah one over

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,960
one over four look one over four

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,479
is equals to uh

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,040
if you times 25 25 over 100 it's the

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,159
same thing yeah it's the same thing same

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,159
portion right

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,159
oh alternatively we can list all the

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,960
possibilities if we saying that facing

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,560
up is one facing down is zero right so

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,799
what's the how many

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,399
different outcomes if i throw these

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,960
coins each coin once so two coins

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,799
so look it will be one one both facing

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,600
up one two one zero first position up

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,840
second facing down cl one

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,920
first facing down

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,240
second facing up and then the other both

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,960
facing down okay so then we can pick

48
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,520
those values yeah look both facing up is

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,750
one out of four right both okay what's

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,680
the probability of pose facing down

51
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,840
[Music]

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,160
what's the probability of the one up one

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,160
down

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,959
one up one time

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,480
two right two out of four yeah you pick

56
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,080
two okay exactly

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,480
okay so

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,800
yeah let's say that's the normal coin

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,280
how about if we have a coin that uh it's

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,840
not normal it's it's very strange like

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
for example the first coin 50 is regular

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,720
but second

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,440
coin coin 20 facing up if you saw that

64
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,200
10 times only two times we're facing up

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,160
we will face up then what's the

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,480
probability of if i throw each coin once

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,480
at both coins

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,160
uh facing up

69
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,840
fifty percent for the first coin twenty

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,680
percent for the second goal

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,000
ten percent yeah you times it together

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,159
right yeah that exactly

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,200
okay so today is tough fifty times

74
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,360
twenty is a thousand right but you have

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,120
a percent your percent yeah so you

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,480
divide by zero divide fifty percent is

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,040
equal to fifty divided by a hundred yeah

78
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,560
a percent look listening

79
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,519
yeah listen what does it mean

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,840
oh yeah

81
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,000
but but this thing is look

82
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,400
percentage you divided by 100. look at

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,400
two zeros two zeros you move these here

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
okay

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,280
we have a point we have a coin the

86
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
probabilities of facing up let's say

87
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,599
probability probabilities are freezing

88
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,640
out like a a list of values of

89
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,680
probability of each coin facing up like

90
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,280
what do we say 0.502

91
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,439
right this is the probability of

92
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,920
throwing this coin facing up yeah and we

93
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,799
are we are about to throw the coins flip

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,720
the coins exactly once per coin right so

95
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,439
we want to find out what's the

96
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,360
probability of having the k coins facing

97
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,040
up

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,000
k equals two and then you need to tell

99
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
me

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,440
if

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,600
one uh is ten percent yeah it's ten

102
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,840
percent ten percent is zero point one

103
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,840
okay

104
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,320
yeah remember a few days ago we talked

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,560
about the subsets on partitioning so

106
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,720
partitioning subsystem remember so what

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,880
was practitioner yeah we have a list of

108
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,759
arrays 1 5

109
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,639
5 11. do you still remember this we want

110
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,800
to we want to partition these into half

111
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,600
and both have equal sum right first of

112
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,600
all we check the sum if it's odd if the

113
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,680
sum is odd it will happen

114
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,560
if this sum of the array

115
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
is odd you can't um yeah yeah because

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,120
yeah you can't separate it because all

117
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,840
the numbers are positive 1.5

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,240
yeah yeah yeah look and then look at 11

119
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,400
we we get the total sum is 22 and then

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,919
the target sum we're looking for is 11

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,039
and now we continue we pick these

122
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,600
numbers

123
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,199
yeah for each for each number we can

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,639
pick or not pick right so if we pick we

125
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,759
subtract

126
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,600
the sum

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,440
this number from these

128
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
right and then continue moving to the

129
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,280
next one remember the dp once you're

130
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,919
right yeah top-notch

131
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,479
enemy programming yeah

132
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,479
and we can skip if we skip this number

133
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,000
for this one we have still have 11 to

134
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,440
pick right

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,520
yeah so remember dfs

136
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,400
we are picking the icon underneath this

137
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,880
sum

138
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,520
we keep we pick it so we pick it with

139
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,880
minus nums i yeah

140
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,080
or we don't pick it oh we don't pick it

141
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,080
uh actually it's i plus one we go to the

142
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,759
next coin and then we don't pick it and

143
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,400
then some will be

144
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,840
remaining will be s right

145
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,080
so for this th this problem uh the coins

146
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,479
for each one

147
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,319
we can let it facing up right or we can

148
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,639
let it facing down right it's it's

149
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,240
almost the same right yeah

150
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,639
the only difference is that we have a

151
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,840
probability right but

152
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,520
but for

153
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,240
for the coin uh

154
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,840
for each coin we can have it facing up

155
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,160
with that probability and what's the

156
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,479
probability of

157
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,160
for example this one's 20 facing out

158
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,160
what's the probability of facing down

159
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,800
everything down come on this is easy 20

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,080
facing up and what's the other half

161
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,080
um

162
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,039
eighty percent facing down yeah so so

163
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,120
basically one minus is one minus this

164
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,639
number is the problem probability of

165
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,479
things because one

166
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,800
bless you one

167
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,880
is one blessing one one is the one

168
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,680
hundred percent one hundred percent is

169
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,440
is everything yeah it's told is that

170
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,120
every outcome right and then i have

171
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
twenty percent facing up and the rest

172
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,840
will be facing down right because all

173
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,720
these two events adding up to one 100

174
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,880
okay

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,680
yeah

176
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,120
so

177
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,000
so let's see

178
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,000
so let's see okay

179
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,400
let's see these

180
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
so this problem might seems a bit tricky

181
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,479
at the beginning but as i said for each

182
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,199
con we have two choice we cannot be

183
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,440
facing up with the probability p

184
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,560
p i and if we let it facing down it'll

185
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,880
be one minus p i right so let's say i

186
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,520
have a function like dfs

187
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,479
and we want to pick from

188
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,160
the icon yeah so if we look at the coins

189
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,080
here p equals

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,039
0.5 0.2 blah blah blah okay so i we

191
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,080
start from zero or we can start we can

192
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,160
start from

193
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,599
remaining it's the same let's say we

194
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,639
start from the beginning we pick the

195
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,919
first point right with some probability

196
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,560
facing out

197
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,759
and then we go in from the right so this

198
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,160
is i and then this is the coin uh

199
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,960
the number of coins facing up already

200
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,400
right

201
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,120
yeah so let's see if i is reaching the

202
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,080
end

203
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,000
and length probability

204
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,160
then we first we need to

205
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,919
do what

206
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
we tend to return what

207
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,319
we want to return the number of

208
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,879
the probability here will be a

209
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,479
probability of zero and one

210
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,360
if k is zero it means the probability

211
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,760
uh is one right return one

212
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,039
if k is zero

213
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,959
otherwise

214
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,880
zero okay what does it mean you mean

215
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,120
that okay so this is the case remember

216
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,160
remember the partitioning sum is the

217
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,480
remaining sum yeah if sum is zero right

218
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,160
we want to reduce it so let's say at the

219
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,240
beginning we want to call it zero and

220
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,880
then okay okay so when it's k

221
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,839
ideally our target is to find the number

222
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,360
of coins face the number of coins which

223
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,600
is k

224
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,640
we want to find out the k coins facing

225
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,680
up right and then if we running out of

226
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,720
coins and then if it's coin

227
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,640
if there's no remaining coins to be

228
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,320
facing up now we do ten one then it

229
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,480
means that we find the

230
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,880
solution right otherwise if we still

231
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,800
have k is positive then it means that

232
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,880
least we still

233
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,200
it means what

234
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,680
it means what it means it means we

235
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,839
haven't enough

236
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,519
we haven't got enough coins facing up am

237
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,720
i yeah

238
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,600
all right

239
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,519
that makes sense so now if i pick it if

240
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,080
i listen facing up if i choose this

241
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,200
phrase now i say choose

242
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,399
choose equals bfs

243
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
i

244
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,440
i choose this one and then i will have

245
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,839
this i plus one right if i choose it

246
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,399
then it will be k

247
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,360
k minus one right

248
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,600
and then this would be probability of

249
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,959
facing up so this is p

250
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,920
i right

251
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,880
right

252
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,600
if i don't choose it if i skip it

253
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,120
right the opposite of choose is skipping

254
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,920
is dfs

255
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,680
if i skip if i skip this coin i still

256
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,120
have to go to next point

257
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,360
but i

258
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,560
i have this balance which is k because

259
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,959
it's not

260
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,480
subtracted yeah skip it and then the

261
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,480
probability will be y minus p i am i

262
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,519
yeah and then the return would be what

263
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,800
we kind of be these two right yeah

264
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,800
choose first skip okay

265
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,160
yeah

266
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,880
makes sense

267
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,560
does it make sense look

268
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,880
that to

269
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,959
for this coin i can let it facing up and

270
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,200
i cannot keep facing down but if i let

271
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,200
this facing up

272
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,000
is this probability if i let things

273
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,640
facing down okay so maybe i i remain is

274
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,519
that facing up okay freezing up facing

275
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,440
down and here i will be returning facing

276
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,240
up not sleeping down okay this probably

277
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,079
yeah

278
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,440
yeah

279
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,480
the probability of this coin face this

280
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,320
is coin facing up is this

281
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,279
p i right

282
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,279
right

283
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,320
and then i need to time choose the next

284
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,000
coin yeah p i plus one k minus one look

285
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,360
because this is facing up so i

286
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,279
substitute one

287
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,440
this is facing down

288
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,279
i keep it as

289
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,880
keep it as it is i'm right

290
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,480
yeah

291
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:42,079
and doesn't make sense larry

292
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,480
kind of doesn't make sense

293
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,880
so look this is starting from i and i

294
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,680
can do it as uh as the other way which

295
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,160
is front yeah which is from the n so

296
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,120
instead of from zero i can say d of x

297
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,240
from the

298
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,639
length p

299
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,480
length p minus 1

300
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,880
k all right because at the beginning we

301
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,519
want to find out if the possibility of

302
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,040
having the k coins facing up right and

303
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,440
then here

304
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,160
i equal equal length p this will be

305
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,480
changed to if i smaller than zero right

306
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,160
and this is the same at least i need to

307
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,160
change what i plus one i need to change

308
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,040
it to what

309
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,639
if i come from the right to the left

310
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,160
i plus one

311
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,200
change to uh i minus y minus one yeah

312
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,480
exactly yeah but look

313
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,560
let's say

314
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,959
i th this one is like start from the

315
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,279
first coin right i start from the first

316
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,560
one i'm looking at i'm about to throw

317
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,440
the first coin

318
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,920
right

319
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:44,880
and i want to have the probability of

320
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,720
k coins facing up right

321
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,720
so now

322
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,600
if it's facing up the probability of

323
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,839
facing up is p i right

324
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,920
yeah here the probability of the first

325
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,240
coin facing down is 1 minus pi

326
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,480
when it's facing out then the next point

327
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,399
i want to consider is i plus 1

328
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,560
but if it's already facing out so

329
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,639
because i want to look for the k coins

330
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,399
you if it's already

331
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,880
facing out so what what should we do

332
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,880
with the k

333
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,200
we should

334
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,959
if it's huh

335
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,720
this is this is quite similar to the

336
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,360
partition sound remember

337
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,200
yeah remember what's instead of k minus

338
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,639
one in the partition sum we substitute

339
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,279
the number right

340
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,040
yeah we we pick we know p right this is

341
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,160
corresponding to that pick a notepad

342
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,920
this is facing up y is minus 9

343
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,519
anybody

344
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,519
that's because that's

345
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,399
what's our target cake

346
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,720
okay

347
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,880
we don't have k coins facing out yeah

348
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,880
and now this coin facing up so what

349
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,279
should we do we should look for k minus

350
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,880
one coin freezing out right yeah because

351
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,279
this coin is already facing up so we

352
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,079
have k minus one to face up but why this

353
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,199
is still 10.

354
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,440
because it's still the amount of

355
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,360
yeah because it's facing down right so i

356
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,959
still have k coins to face out right

357
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,399
what's the probability of facing this

358
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,800
coin facing down

359
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,120
one minus p i right yeah and then the

360
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,399
result would be these two yeah why this

361
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,839
is plus no multiply

362
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,279
that's because

363
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,240
um

364
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,240
yes um

365
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,079
these two events are independent right

366
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,480
independent you're identical

367
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,399
but if these two coins these if these

368
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,560
two events are associated you multiply

369
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,360
like the first coin 0.5 the second one

370
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,910
0.5 and both coins

371
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,040
having

372
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,839
[Music]

373
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,199
the both coins having the

374
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,560
uh facing up and it's time right yeah

375
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,680
if 50 of the coins

376
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,360
if these two events are separate right

377
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,800
yeah

378
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,320
there's 50

379
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,320
of the coin

380
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,720
facing up but and then also there's

381
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,000
another 50 this coin single coin facing

382
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,320
down what's the probability of

383
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
of these two events you pass it together

384
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,360
you know multiply because these two

385
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,760
events are independent right yeah so

386
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,720
so for the probability usually you have

387
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,480
two kinds of operations you multiply

388
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,399
yeah or you add it

389
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,040
you add it if these two events are

390
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,800
independent you multiply if these two

391
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,120
events are associated uh um

392
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,360
what do we it is

393
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,920
it's like this corner inside the content

394
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,639
you want to have both coins

395
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,720
yeah it's like uh

396
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,560
price uh

397
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,079
remember the the

398
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,440
what naive bayes right nine base

399
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,880
p

400
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
b

401
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,320
a yeah

402
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,000
the probability of b even a occurs okay

403
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,040
given a occurs

404
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,759
yeah

405
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,240
the probability b given a test the

406
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,959
probability this is a this is b the

407
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,360
probability of b given a occurs right

408
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,680
you time these together right yeah

409
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,680
okay

410
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,880
what's the time complexity for this one

411
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,240
remember

412
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,360
yeah this is quite similar to

413
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,079
partitioning some thing

414
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,959
it's almost less what's missing here

415
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,279
cash we're done cash yeah because if

416
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,040
you're not putting the cash

417
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,959
exponential yeah because this

418
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,920
intermediate values will be

419
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,959
be

420
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,880
you you can treat you can

421
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,800
we can look at this list function

422
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,480
because you have i

423
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,720
i belongs to

424
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,800
what belongs to 0 to n right yeah

425
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,000
belongs to 0 to k k

426
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,560
k is the

427
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,560
integer right so that time if these how

428
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,519
many states are there so that's

429
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,360
okay n yeah okay and

430
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,040
if we put a cash

431
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,440
if we create a cash

432
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,240
there are how many possibilities for for

433
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,799
this

434
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,640
for this function of course

435
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,079
i mean

436
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,319
d i k

437
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,679
k n k times n right this is number

438
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,439
because look i

439
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,919
have n choice

440
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,959
okay so this is another probability that

441
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,600
i i will be n choice k will be k choice

442
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,199
how many different outcomes

443
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,319
how many different outcomes were for

444
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,319
this dfs function

445
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,360
this first number is i choice look it's

446
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,640
a table it's it's a table right i

447
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,240
uh you you have this table yeah

448
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,880
you have this table

449
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,120
this is i this is k k will be start from

450
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,720
zero one two to k

451
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,520
i will be start from zero one to n right

452
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,200
so how many values are there

453
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,679
n square

454
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,280
no no this is n this is k how many

455
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,520
values are there

456
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,640
n times k exactly right if we put a

457
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,600
cache

458
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,480
yeah

459
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
yeah

460
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,679
can i

461
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,200
please don't touch it yeah

462
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,160
it's shaking

463
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,080
okay

464
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,480
so yeah it will put a cash right if you

465
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,160
don't put a cash what happened look for

466
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,080
example i want to calculate this value

467
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,360
and i need to spend like two hours

468
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,440
calculating calculating this value right

469
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,919
okay and then i dump i don't catch it i

470
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,880
install some value here and then later

471
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,960
here

472
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,280
you call this function again and what

473
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,120
happened if there's no case whatever

474
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,120
he would keep he would spend another two

475
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,280
hours of working all this value before

476
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,760
it's working all the value that that's

477
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,039
the magic of cash we ask computer to

478
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,200
remember for us so only if we put a

479
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,480
cache what happened each value in the

480
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,039
table

481
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,440
is only calculated once all right

482
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,520
yeah alright doesn't make sense

483
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,000
yeah because because sometimes look if i

484
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,480
calculate this value i might use other

485
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,400
values in the table again but

486
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,640
i might just use these two values three

487
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,640
values right

488
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,640
and again i calculate this value i need

489
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,360
to work out this value

490
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,760
look evenly those values

491
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,000
need to be

492
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,320
taking a lot of time to calculate it if

493
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,880
we spend like hours taking length in

494
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,200
this value then exponential right that's

495
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,679
the magic of putting cash make sure that

496
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,400
each value is calculated exactly once

497
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,480
once we have the value we remember here

498
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,760
let's say one that's two

499
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,799
okay no so i might spend ten hours on

500
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,880
these two

501
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,400
to get the value too but next time i use

502
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,799
it i don't

503
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,320
i don't spend another 10 hours doing the

504
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,559
same work again because i already

505
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,080
calculated i put it in the notebook

506
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,440
right

507
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,280
yeah

508
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,720
doesn't make sense

509
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,000
it's like okay

510
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,840
what's the sum of one plus two class

511
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,840
three plus tier 100

512
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,919
okay

513
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,440
what's the sum of one plus two plus

514
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,080
three plus

515
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,600
a hundred and one

516
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,240
um

517
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,240
yeah hello

518
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,159
okay

519
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,400
how do you get this number because i

520
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,640
just said 101 to 250 percent exactly

521
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,080
let's dynamic programming let's exactly

522
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,880
dynamic programming right because

523
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,000
you already know this is answer so

524
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,919
this bit is

525
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,320
5050. you just need to add one more do

526
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,080
you need to start from the beginning no

527
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,520
that's dynamic programming okay same

528
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,440
thing

529
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,080
same thing

530
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,240
but this is this is this top down open

531
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,240
up

532
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,679
top down we put a cache we ask computer

533
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,240
to remember this for us correctly

534
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,320
if if we we want to store this value in

535
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,960
this table

536
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,400
let's call what

537
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,320
what does it call

538
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,799
if we store the values in a table what

539
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,799
do we call it

540
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,480
what's the opposite of drop down

541
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,280
but

542
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,520
we proactively store the values in this

543
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,360
table and we call it dynamic programming

544
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,720
but for this one it's top-down enemy it

545
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,280
okay yeah make sense yeah look okay one

546
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,200
last thing is that this is quite similar

547
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,960
to to picking the values they are

548
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,039
picking the values look

549
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,440
picking a value instead

550
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,679
instead of picking the value you

551
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,240
remember the partition subset sum yeah

552
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,039
instead of this probability you have you

553
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,280
have what you have this sum k minus nums

554
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,520
i right you just replace it with k

555
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,480
numbers like yeah all right

556
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,679
yeah and all others are similar yeah

557
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,240
similar

558
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,919
okay instead of because this is not

559
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,080
uh

560
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,400
we just we just return

561
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,039
k equals zero right it's not probability

562
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,039
one zero we just return true if if k

563
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,159
equals zero otherwise

564
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,480
four i remember the subset sum right

565
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,480
yeah

566
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,840
makes sense for the subsystem remember

567
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,480
yeah for each number we can pick or not

568
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,640
pick if we pick we know minus one

569
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,200
instead we minus one

570
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,760
instead of one num yeah yeah this is the

571
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,919
sum remember the eleventh thing you have

572
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,760
one five five eleven

573
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,679
this is twenty two sum

574
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,960
we want to look for the sum half which

575
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,799
is 11 k equals 11 right

576
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,240
and then if we pick it we substitute

577
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,640
this number if we don't pick it we still

578
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,679
have the k sum right

579
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,240
yeah and then we don't have this

580
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,559
probability now only difference is this

581
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,120
we have a probability here

582
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,039
and we have a minus one here and we tend

583
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,159
one if k equals zero i don't know i zero

584
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,440
okay

585
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,360
make sense

586
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,120
yeah any questions so far tomorrow we're

587
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,799
gonna talk about potable

588
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,280
you see the first day we talk about top

589
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,200
down the second day we talk about

590
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,240
yeah

591
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,840
makes sense

592
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,360
okay that's it for today good job

593
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,760
bye bye okay one last thing the time

594
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,760
come next

595
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,319
time

596
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,319
[Music]

597
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,760
what's the space complexity

598
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,360
look at this table what's the time from

599
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,360
recipe

600
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,809
[Music]

601
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
tv

602
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,799
okay so let's face time come back to

603
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,679
space once it is supposed to encounter

604
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,679
okay that's it for today bye
