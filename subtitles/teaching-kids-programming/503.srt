1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
right

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,500
on the space 2D Space X Y right X Y you

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,500
know this is

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,260
the condition X Y right so any we we are

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,900
talking about any four points any four

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,960
points on the space can you tell me

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,580
if we can use these four points to make

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,619
a square yes

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,980
so how do we check if it's a square

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,739
edges so edges by these four points you

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,320
have P1 P2 P3 P4 is not given in order

12
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:41,700
so you know it could be P1 here P2 here

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,440
P3 here P4 here so as long as uh these

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,300
four four points computation we can make

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,700
that square then return true so any idea

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,640
I mean each he said edges the distance

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,379
given two points on Space how do we

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,559
calculate the distance

19
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,180
you know this here here how do we

20
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,859
calculate the distance

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:05,220
for example if this one is X1 y1 this

22
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,280
one is X2 Y2 if we are talking about 2D

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,860
Dimension so the distance distance

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,520
how do you calculate distance

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,520
is

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,380
is what so easily this this is a

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,439
triangle right triangle yeah we talk

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,619
about this right triangle

29
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,920
okay this is a this is B

30
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:32,939
this is C remember yeah so what do we

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,579
have a square plus p square equals c

32
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,460
square right very important this is y

33
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:42,720
times 90 degree A and B so look at this

34
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,159
speed this bit is X1 minus X2 or X2

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,240
minus X1

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:52,259
yeah this absolute value okay this bit

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,939
y1 minus Y2 or Y 2 minus y1 right so if

38
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,259
we Square it

39
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,420
squared plus y1 minus y 2 squared and

40
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:05,780
then equal this the distance square

41
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,780
equals distance square right look so

42
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:13,620
so we just do this uh square root of

43
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,980
both sides right so that become D

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:21,720
distance equals square root of X1 minus

45
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:24,300
X2 square plus y y minus Y2 Square now

46
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,920
Four Points so we can just prove us the

47
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,739
distance we calculate the distance

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,920
between any two pairs any two points

49
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,680
and then we put it in a set

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,360
so how many different distance do we

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,580
have if it's a square come on this is a

52
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,780
question if we calculate any pair of

53
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,819
distance

54
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,580
how many possibilities if it's a square

55
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,400
how many possibilities okay so look

56
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,160
maybe my question was not clear so if we

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,440
calculate the distance right so between

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,660
any two points so how many possibilities

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,099
if it's a square right if it's a square

60
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,400
how many possibilities how about the

61
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,560
values how about this the diagonals okay

62
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,879
yeah

63
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,540
so how many possibilities

64
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,360
two two yeah yeah look at these at least

65
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,519
yeah look at least four same

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,840
the diagnose the same right

67
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,879
so so simple Four Points we prove us the

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,800
pairs

69
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,720
yeah if it's different like you'll

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,760
calculate this distance distance

71
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,620
distance distance

72
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,299
and we put it in a set and if it's a

73
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,360
square then

74
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,400
the set the number of distance different

75
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,340
kind of distance in a set should be two

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,780
right because it's but there's a very

77
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,319
special case

78
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:45,299
it's not it's not enough look how about

79
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:48,540
look if P1 P2 and P3

80
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,580
the three values they they are the same

81
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,920
they collect

82
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,959
in one point and how about P4 is here so

83
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,920
how many how many distance here some

84
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:02,040
distance two right the one distance P1

85
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,379
and P1 distance to P2 is zero so zero

86
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,480
and that is also two so but we have to

87
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:09,060
is through this this situation am I

88
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,879
right yeah okay so the idea is that we

89
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,519
put we compute the distance between all

90
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,459
pair of combinations of vertex therefore

91
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,440
right so we can prove something easily

92
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,919
and I will check the size of the

93
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,840
distance set it has to be two and also

94
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,780
we checked

95
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,060
the distance of zero it shouldn't be any

96
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,400
because if it's any means that two

97
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,080
points or more they are the same right

98
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,419
they are the same points they just

99
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,000
Collide in space

100
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:41,639
okay so okay coming back to this this is

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,919
the coefficient distance for the 2D

102
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,380
space and we can extend this to 3D space

103
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,460
as well look look what's the distance

104
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,580
between

105
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,580
please please send this look XYZ right

106
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,740
the first street is 3D for the 3D look

107
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,220
this is 2D right 3D

108
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,220
X

109
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,560
y okay if you have to imagine and Z okay

110
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,139
so 3D space

111
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,620
x y z

112
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:12,120
okay let me just write it here

113
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,220
okay

114
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,639
so therefore Point P one p two P three p

115
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,320
four okay T equals D4 fictionally we're

116
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,060
going to count right we don't count the

117
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,699
distance the keys will be distance the

118
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:28,199
variables will be uh how many times of

119
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:32,720
this distance an array equals we put it

120
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:38,520
in a sample P1 P2

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:41,820
P3 T4 and then for distance for I in

122
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:46,440
range 4 right we are given four points

123
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:49,320
for J in range for J in range I okay so

124
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,699
then we can calculate the distance of a

125
00:05:49,320 --> 00:06:00,620
r i to a r j so the distance would be

126
00:05:53,699 --> 00:06:03,000
distance d i s t a r r i a r r z

127
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,699
okay we come back to this all right

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,340
distance actually is very simple Define

129
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,600
distance

130
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:15,419
uh a b V10

131
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:20,639
sqrt square root square root square root

132
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:24,900
of a0 minus B zero

133
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:28,620
Square Times 2 plus

134
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:32,400
a 1 minus P1

135
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:38,520
times 2 squared okay this is a distance

136
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:40,440
so d d okay then we use t d d plus

137
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,539
equals right we take it at the distance

138
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,639
with plus equals one we count how many

139
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:47,639
how many times the distance appear in

140
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,620
the in a in a sec in this is a

141
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,900
dictionary okay and then at the end we

142
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,699
just have to check

143
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:57,000
DD

144
00:06:52,699 --> 00:07:00,120
t zero needs to be zero right

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
we don't allowed any two points that are

146
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,259
the same right zero distance zero should

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,759
be zero

148
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,539
and

149
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,880
men's T needs to equals how many how

150
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:14,520
many two yeah

151
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,580
why I love it right what's the time time

152
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,539
like see if you look at this

153
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,979
yeah because we're working on four

154
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,900
points and we just do some calculation

155
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,340
what have you learned today what's the

156
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,819
problem what have you done today

157
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,280
The Violet Square we have given four

158
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,259
points

159
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,180
square if we can make a square out of

160
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,280
these four points right so how do we

161
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,660
check we count

162
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,520
the distance between the vertex right

163
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,099
if it's a square how many kinds of

164
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,780
distance do we have two yeah but also

165
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,340
there's a very special case we have to

166
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,099
rule out which is

167
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:53,400
this one three points actually the same

168
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:56,280
analyze P4 because look if you calculate

169
