1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,509

hello today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
hello today we're going to talk about
 

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,910
hello today we're going to talk about
symmetric three what's symmetric

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920

 

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,390

symmetry

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400

 

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,590

the same on both sides okay so

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
the same on both sides okay so
 

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,630
the same on both sides okay so
how about if i give you a tree is this

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
how about if i give you a tree is this
 

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,150
how about if i give you a tree is this
magic is this no no

12
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
magic is this no no
 

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,630
magic is this no no
okay so can you draw a binary tree which

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
okay so can you draw a binary tree which
 

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,790
okay so can you draw a binary tree which
is symmetric okay

16
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
is symmetric okay
 

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,549
is symmetric okay
wait i probably could give you a nice

18
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559

 

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,670

this is can you get the more notes like

20
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
this is can you get the more notes like
 

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,630
this is can you get the more notes like
another two or three you know i will do

22
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
another two or three you know i will do
 

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,830
another two or three you know i will do
it another one

24
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
it another one
 

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,590
it another one
okay that's fine i'll get ten another

26
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
okay that's fine i'll get ten another
 

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,029
okay that's fine i'll get ten another
one

28
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
one
 

29
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,549
one
okay and then yeah

30
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
okay and then yeah
 

31
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,970
okay and then yeah
so let's put here yeah four yeah

32
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:00,980

 

33
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:11,190

[Music]

34
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200

 

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,190

oh wow okay let's see now let's see

36
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
oh wow okay let's see now let's see
 

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,310
oh wow okay let's see now let's see
enough right now i don't know

38
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
enough right now i don't know
 

39
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,590
enough right now i don't know
let's see right you don't you don't need

40
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
let's see right you don't you don't need
 

41
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,230
let's see right you don't you don't need
to stop can you tell me

42
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
to stop can you tell me
 

43
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,310
to stop can you tell me
why can you explain what are the

44
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
why can you explain what are the
 

45
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,789
why can you explain what are the
symmetric trees

46
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799

 

47
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,830

and then and then

48
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
and then and then
 

49
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,030
and then and then
and then

50
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040

 

51
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,830

and then it's what yeah

52
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840

 

53
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,429

it's quite similar to yesterday we

54
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
it's quite similar to yesterday we
 

55
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,190
it's quite similar to yesterday we
talked about invert yeah

56
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
talked about invert yeah
 

57
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,990
talked about invert yeah
even when you use police thing in here

58
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
even when you use police thing in here
 

59
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,469
even when you use police thing in here
right

60
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
right
 

61
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,670
right
but now we are just we just like a piece

62
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
but now we are just we just like a piece
 

63
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,190
but now we are just we just like a piece
of paper we just fold it

64
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
of paper we just fold it
 

65
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,830
of paper we just fold it
yeah when we fold it it needs to be

66
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
yeah when we fold it it needs to be
 

67
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,429
yeah when we fold it it needs to be
together exactly the same yeah

68
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
together exactly the same yeah
 

69
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,310
together exactly the same yeah
that's called symmetric okay got it yes

70
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
that's called symmetric okay got it yes
 

71
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,149
that's called symmetric okay got it yes
does it make sense

72
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
does it make sense
 

73
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,069
does it make sense
yes okay so now you tell me

74
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
yes okay so now you tell me
 

75
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,270
yes okay so now you tell me
so symmetric if a tree even i give you a

76
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
so symmetric if a tree even i give you a
 

77
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,469
so symmetric if a tree even i give you a
root yeah a root

78
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
root yeah a root
 

79
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,469
root yeah a root
and then you know the left tree or right

80
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
and then you know the left tree or right
 

81
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,590
and then you know the left tree or right
tree

82
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
tree
 

83
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,190
tree
then one way of thinking a tree is

84
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
then one way of thinking a tree is
 

85
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,910
then one way of thinking a tree is
symmetric

86
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
symmetric
 

87
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,270
symmetric
is that its left tree should be mineral

88
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
is that its left tree should be mineral
 

89
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,150
is that its left tree should be mineral
to the right tree all right yeah this

90
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
to the right tree all right yeah this
 

91
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,350
to the right tree all right yeah this
should be middle

92
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
should be middle
 

93
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,750
should be middle
not the same so in order to do this we

94
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
not the same so in order to do this we
 

95
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,430
not the same so in order to do this we
can define

96
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
can define
 

97
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,510
can define
first of all we define uh a function

98
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
first of all we define uh a function
 

99
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,030
first of all we define uh a function
is symmetric okay symmetric

100
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
is symmetric okay symmetric
 

101
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,949
is symmetric okay symmetric
a b and i wait wait a two three is a

102
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
a b and i wait wait a two three is a
 

103
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,150
a b and i wait wait a two three is a
and b okay okay and

104
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
and b okay okay and
 

105
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,750
and b okay okay and
if if we wait wait wait

106
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
if if we wait wait wait
 

107
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,110
if if we wait wait wait
let me say if a

108
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
let me say if a
 

109
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,110
let me say if a
is noun and b is non so if both are

110
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
is noun and b is non so if both are
 

111
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,589
is noun and b is non so if both are
empty

112
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
empty
 

113
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,630
empty
so what should we return why because the

114
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
so what should we return why because the
 

115
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,830
so what should we return why because the
empty nodes are

116
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
empty nodes are
 

117
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,869
empty nodes are
called uh if two two threes are nothing

118
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
called uh if two two threes are nothing
 

119
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,470
called uh if two two threes are nothing
both nothing

120
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
both nothing
 

121
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,110
both nothing
then they should be considered as

122
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
then they should be considered as
 

123
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,550
then they should be considered as
symmetric yeah

124
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
symmetric yeah
 

125
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,750
symmetric yeah
and then if at least any stage

126
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
and then if at least any stage
 

127
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,190
and then if at least any stage
the blade must not be the same

128
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
the blade must not be the same
 

129
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,589
the blade must not be the same
noun at the same time so if if one of

130
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
noun at the same time so if if one of
 

131
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,869
noun at the same time so if if one of
them is noun

132
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
them is noun
 

133
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,949
them is noun
if a is noun or b is noun

134
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
if a is noun or b is noun
 

135
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,190
if a is noun or b is noun
why because if one is something the

136
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
why because if one is something the
 

137
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,229
why because if one is something the
other is nothing

138
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
other is nothing
 

139
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,030
other is nothing
yeah it's not lovely confidence magic

140
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
yeah it's not lovely confidence magic
 

141
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,350
yeah it's not lovely confidence magic
right

142
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
right
 

143
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,430
right
yeah yeah so can you give me an example

144
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
yeah yeah so can you give me an example
 

145
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,509
yeah yeah so can you give me an example
for example like

146
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
for example like
 

147
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,910
for example like
look look if it's one two and you could

148
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
look look if it's one two and you could
 

149
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,910
look look if it's one two and you could
do nothing on the right hand side

150
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
do nothing on the right hand side
 

151
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,589
do nothing on the right hand side
so this must not be a symmetric because

152
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
so this must not be a symmetric because
 

153
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,270
so this must not be a symmetric because
we've got nothing yeah you got something

154
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
we've got nothing yeah you got something
 

155
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,390
we've got nothing yeah you got something
on the left hand side

156
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
on the left hand side
 

157
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,670
on the left hand side
so return four

158
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
so return four
 

159
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,830
so return four
this is return two yeah i forgot to put

160
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
this is return two yeah i forgot to put
 

161
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,750
this is return two yeah i forgot to put
it okay now

162
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
it okay now
 

163
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,589
it okay now
now look look

164
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
now look look
 

165
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,710
now look look
now i check at this at this stage now i

166
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
now i check at this at this stage now i
 

167
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,830
now i check at this at this stage now i
need to check

168
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
need to check
 

169
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,869
need to check
if their values are the same right look

170
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
if their values are the same right look
 

171
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,390
if their values are the same right look
if uh so this is

172
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
if uh so this is
 

173
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,710
if uh so this is
left and right a and b okay this is a

174
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
left and right a and b okay this is a
 

175
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,589
left and right a and b okay this is a
and b

176
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
and b
 

177
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,030
and b
and then i need to check look this is

178
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
and then i need to check look this is
 

179
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,390
and then i need to check look this is
c d b e

180
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
c d b e
 

181
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,270
c d b e
f this is a and b okay this is a and b a

182
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
f this is a and b okay this is a and b a
 

183
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,589
f this is a and b okay this is a and b a
and b

184
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
and b
 

185
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,469
and b
and c d e f so now i need to check a and

186
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
and c d e f so now i need to check a and
 

187
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,469
and c d e f so now i need to check a and
b's value should be the same right

188
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
b's value should be the same right
 

189
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,870
b's value should be the same right
so i can say return a the value

190
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
so i can say return a the value
 

191
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,310
so i can say return a the value
add the equals equals

192
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
add the equals equals
 

193
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,469
add the equals equals
b b

194
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479

 

195
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,189

so look if the play they are not the

196
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
so look if the play they are not the
 

197
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,590
so look if the play they are not the
same

198
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
same
 

199
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,230
same
then we know it's not symmetric right

200
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
then we know it's not symmetric right
 

201
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,430
then we know it's not symmetric right
because they must be

202
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
because they must be
 

203
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,749
because they must be
mirror yeah they must be the same right

204
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
mirror yeah they must be the same right
 

205
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,830
mirror yeah they must be the same right
and now we can recursively recall itself

206
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
and now we can recursively recall itself
 

207
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,550
and now we can recursively recall itself
right return

208
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
right return
 

209
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,390
right return
n is metric asymmetric

210
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
n is metric asymmetric
 

211
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,590
n is metric asymmetric
okay i'm going to write a the left

212
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
okay i'm going to write a the left
 

213
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,710
okay i'm going to write a the left
just be the left now now at the left

214
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
just be the left now now at the left
 

215
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,270
just be the left now now at the left
should be

216
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
should be
 

217
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,390
should be
the same as b right you see yeah it's

218
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
the same as b right you see yeah it's
 

219
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,430
the same as b right you see yeah it's
not left look

220
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
not left look
 

221
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,909
not left look
in order to symmetric a the c should be

222
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
in order to symmetric a the c should be
 

223
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,629
in order to symmetric a the c should be
the same as

224
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
the same as
 

225
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,510
the same as
f symmetric right because it's folding

226
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
f symmetric right because it's folding
 

227
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,790
f symmetric right because it's folding
yeah so this is b

228
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
yeah so this is b
 

229
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,950
yeah so this is b
dot right and then can you tell me

230
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
dot right and then can you tell me
 

231
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:18,310
dot right and then can you tell me
what's next it's magic

232
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320

 

233
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,390

b the left is this one so when you fold

234
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
b the left is this one so when you fold
 

235
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,310
b the left is this one so when you fold
it together these two should be the same

236
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
it together these two should be the same
 

237
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,909
it together these two should be the same
yeah these two ship in the same least

238
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
yeah these two ship in the same least
 

239
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,189
yeah these two ship in the same least
value should be the same

240
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
value should be the same
 

241
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,430
value should be the same
okay and then if you want to symmetric a

242
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
okay and then if you want to symmetric a
 

243
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,110
okay and then if you want to symmetric a
binary tree

244
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
binary tree
 

245
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,270
binary tree
no then we could we just need to call it

246
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
no then we could we just need to call it
 

247
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,029
no then we could we just need to call it
return

248
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
return
 

249
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:41,029
return
symmetric reads left magic

250
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039

 

251
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,189

right because look even loose then i

252
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
right because look even loose then i
 

253
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,950
right because look even loose then i
just need to call this okay this left

254
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
just need to call this okay this left
 

255
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,790
just need to call this okay this left
tree and the right tree

256
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
tree and the right tree
 

257
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,830
tree and the right tree
should be symmetric okay

258
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
should be symmetric okay
 

259
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,390
should be symmetric okay
yes okay so what's the time complexity

260
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
yes okay so what's the time complexity
 

261
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,749
yes okay so what's the time complexity
where is what's the end the numbers oh

262
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
where is what's the end the numbers oh
 

263
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,950
where is what's the end the numbers oh
how many nights the number of nights

264
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
how many nights the number of nights
 

265
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,830
how many nights the number of nights
a number notes in the final street okay

266
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840
a number notes in the final street okay
 

267
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,110
a number notes in the final street okay
well

268
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
well
 

269
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,990
well
okay okay wait wait what's the space

270
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
okay okay wait wait what's the space
 

271
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,710
okay okay wait wait what's the space
complexity

272
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
complexity
 

273
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,749
complexity
why because

274
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
why because
 

275
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,870
why because
and another all night again because we

276
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
and another all night again because we
 

277
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,670
and another all night again because we
need to

278
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
need to
 

279
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,469
need to
check each we need to check each note

280
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
check each we need to check each note
 

281
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,189
check each we need to check each note
right

282
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
right
 

283
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,950
right
we actually need to check each other

284
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960

 

285
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,870

okay so can you tell me which parts are

286
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
okay so can you tell me which parts are
 

287
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:43,749
okay so can you tell me which parts are
the cushion remember like yesterday

288
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759

 

289
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,870

which part exactly is here yeah

290
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
which part exactly is here yeah
 

291
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,270
which part exactly is here yeah
yeah look the cushion is calling itself

292
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
yeah look the cushion is calling itself
 

293
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,990
yeah look the cushion is calling itself
not this

294
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
not this
 

295
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,790
not this
here and here right here yeah yeah

296
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
here and here right here yeah yeah
 

297
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,469
here and here right here yeah yeah
because we are calling itself

298
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
because we are calling itself
 

299
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,510
because we are calling itself
to iterate and recursively check if both

300
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
to iterate and recursively check if both
 

301
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,280
to iterate and recursively check if both
stop trees no no yeah

302
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,290

 

303
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,120

[Applause]

304
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,130

306
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919

 

307
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,039

okay no more
