hello hello eric are you all right

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
hello hello eric are you all right
 

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,950
hello hello eric are you all right
yeah okay so today we'll talk about very

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:06,960
yeah okay so today we'll talk about very
 

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,430
yeah okay so today we'll talk about very
simple

6
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
simple
 

7
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,589
simple
problem concatenation what's this mean

8
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
problem concatenation what's this mean
 

9
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,589
problem concatenation what's this mean
concatenation

10
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
concatenation
 

11
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,509
concatenation
of arrays what does this mean

12
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,519
of arrays what does this mean
 

13
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,870
of arrays what does this mean
concatenate okay it means that you

14
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:18,880
concatenate okay it means that you
 

15
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,070
concatenate okay it means that you
come that you call a cat

16
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
come that you call a cat
 

17
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,589
come that you call a cat
and then you aim it and yeah it's put

18
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
and then you aim it and yeah it's put
 

19
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,390
and then you aim it and yeah it's put
things one after another nation we put

20
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
things one after another nation we put
 

21
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,390
things one after another nation we put
one thing after another okay

22
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
one thing after another okay
 

23
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,389
one thing after another okay
so i have a array all right a

24
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:34,399
so i have a array all right a
 

25
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,790
so i have a array all right a
one two three and i have another array

26
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
one two three and i have another array
 

27
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,470
one two three and i have another array
b equals four five six

28
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:42,480
b equals four five six
 

29
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,270
b equals four five six
so continuation you pull them together

30
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
so continuation you pull them together
 

31
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,470
so continuation you pull them together
so look yeah

32
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480

 

33
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,510

so how do we do this in 1915 how do we

34
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
so how do we do this in 1915 how do we
 

35
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,389
so how do we do this in 1915 how do we
use

36
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
use
 

37
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,590
use
in python how do we do it

38
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
in python how do we do it
 

39
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,910
in python how do we do it
do we need to do it actually it's very

40
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
do we need to do it actually it's very
 

41
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,950
do we need to do it actually it's very
simple

42
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
simple
 

43
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,710
simple
a and b need to be in the right order

44
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
a and b need to be in the right order
 

45
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,990
a and b need to be in the right order
no no just put a you just put b after

46
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
no no just put a you just put b after
 

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,390
no no just put a you just put b after
a that's congratulation yeah so you

48
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
a that's congratulation yeah so you
 

49
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,789
a that's congratulation yeah so you
don't move anything doesn't matter if it

50
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
don't move anything doesn't matter if it
 

51
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,990
don't move anything doesn't matter if it
gets one of these

52
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
gets one of these
 

53
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,469
gets one of these
yes no no no just keep the original

54
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
yes no no no just keep the original
 

55
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,230
yes no no no just keep the original
order so you put these at the end so

56
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
order so you put these at the end so
 

57
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,190
order so you put these at the end so
yeah so what what do we have this here

58
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200

 

59
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,950

yeah we're done that's that's that's the

60

yeah we're done that's that's that's the
 

61
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,109
yeah we're done that's that's that's the
basic today okay concatenation over to

62
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
basic today okay concatenation over to
 

63
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,149
basic today okay concatenation over to
the left

64
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
the left
 

65
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,149
the left
but today it's uh we talked about

66
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
but today it's uh we talked about

interesting is that i have already done
 

71
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,990
interesting is that i have already done
yeah

72
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
yeah
 

73
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,109

and i want to make it make it look dumb
equals one two three right yeah i want

76
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
equals one two three right yeah i want
 

77
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,190
equals one two three right yeah i want
you to return

78
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
you to return
 

79
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,670
you to return
a concatenation of itself so you'll be

80
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
a concatenation of itself so you'll be
 

81
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,590
a concatenation of itself so you'll be
one two three

82
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
one two three
 

83
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,630
one two three
and one two three

85
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,429

so how long does it mean we just double

86
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
so how long does it mean we just double
 

87
00:01:59,439 --> 00:01:59,749
so how long does it mean we just double
it

88
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759

return if
 

93
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,550
return if
this is number return one nums

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
this is number return one nums
 

95
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,430
this is number return one nums
wait is the numbers one two three yeah

also return
numbs you can also what two

110
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
numbs you can also what two
 

111
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,710
numbs you can also what two
three numbers numbers what too

112
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
three numbers numbers what too
 

113

how about if i tell you written

116
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
how about if i tell you written
 

117
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:43,910
how about if i tell you written
nouns

118
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920

 

119
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,670

how about if i tell you you can't use

120
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
how about if i tell you you can't use
 

121
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,430
how about if i tell you you can't use
this

122
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
this
 

123
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,790
this
you can't use the and

124
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
you can't use the and
 

125
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,309
you can't use the and
times okay

126
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
times okay
 

127
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,190
times okay
so say i think it's something like

128
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200

 

129
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,309

so if i tell you you can't okay so

so if i tell you you can't okay so
 

131
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,589
so if i tell you you can't okay so
you make two nouns and then you put them

132
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
you make two nouns and then you put them
 

133
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,630
you make two nouns and then you put them
together

134
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
together
 

135
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,830
together

137
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,589

no i you can't put the two numbers so

138
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
no i you can't put the two numbers so
 

139
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,869
no i you can't put the two numbers so
that's what i'm saying i give you one

171
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,710
be a separate so if we want to keep copy
remember we have a diff copy

172
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
remember we have a diff copy
 

173
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,990
remember we have a diff copy
yeah i could just say d copy yeah answer

174
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
yeah i could just say d copy yeah answer
 

175
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,550
yeah i could just say d copy yeah answer
equals one

176
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
equals one
 

177
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,830

answer the copy numbers and answer the
 

205
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,550
answer the copy numbers and answer the

207
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,749
numbers
what's the difference um i'll say

208
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
what's the difference um i'll say
 

209
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,350
what's the difference um i'll say
it's a copy of them and what's this

210
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
it's a copy of them and what's this
 

211
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,909
it's a copy of them and what's this
it's just norms and it's an alias this

212
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
it's just norms and it's an alias this
 

213
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,670
it's just norms and it's an alias this
one is

214
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
one is
 

215
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,510
one is
called you know it's not difficult it's

216
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
called you know it's not difficult it's
 

217
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,310
called you know it's not difficult it's
shallow cop here

218
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
shallow cop here
 

219
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,830
shallow cop here
shallow shallow copy the opposite of t

220
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
shallow shallow copy the opposite of t
 

221
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,870
shallow shallow copy the opposite of t
so what happened answer is deep copy

222
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
so what happened answer is deep copy
 

223
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,550
so what happened answer is deep copy
they are separate they are individual

224
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
they are separate they are individual
 

225
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,469
they are separate they are individual
right so they're independent of each

226
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
right so they're independent of each
 

227
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,749
right so they're independent of each
other but at least one answer

228
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
other but at least one answer
 

229
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,830
other but at least one answer
numbers whatever so you'll be one two

230
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
numbers whatever so you'll be one two
 

231
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,230
numbers whatever so you'll be one two
three here and if you do this

232
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
three here and if you do this
 

233
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,029
three here and if you do this
answer will be like that it's an area

234
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
answer will be like that it's an area
 

235
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,550
answer will be like that it's an area
numbers will be like that

236
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
numbers will be like that
 

237
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,430
numbers will be like that
so if you you say answer zero equals

238
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
so if you you say answer zero equals
 

239
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,629
so if you you say answer zero equals
zero right

240
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
zero right
 

241
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,790
zero right
the num zero will be also equal to zero

242
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
the num zero will be also equal to zero
 

243
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,310
the num zero will be also equal to zero
don't get it it's an alias

244
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
don't get it it's an alias
 

245
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,230
don't get it it's an alias
yeah but follow for the deep copy

246
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
yeah but follow for the deep copy
 

247
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,029
yeah but follow for the deep copy
it's a separate one two three so if you

248
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
it's a separate one two three so if you
 

249
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:21,670
it's a separate one two three so if you
say

250
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
say
 

251
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,189
say
answer zero equals zero it doesn't

252
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
answer zero equals zero it doesn't
 

253
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,110
answer zero equals zero it doesn't
affect the number look at it

254
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
affect the number look at it
 

255
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,830
affect the number look at it
okay yeah so in this case we're using

256
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
okay yeah so in this case we're using
 

257
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,230
okay yeah so in this case we're using
deep copy yeah

258
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
deep copy yeah
 

259
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,710

with a little bit thinking so uh
 

303
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,950
with a little bit thinking so uh
okay so do we need to actually know the
