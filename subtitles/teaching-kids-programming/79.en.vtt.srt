this is this one means one this zero
 

31
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,150
this is this one means one this zero
means zero times two

32
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160

what's that
how many this is 2

100
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
how many this is 2
 

101
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,430
how many this is 2
what's this is 2 to the power of

102
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
what's this is 2 to the power of
 

103
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,630
what's this is 2 to the power of
what 2 to the power

104
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
what 2 to the power
 

105
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,630
what 2 to the power
how many twos comes together

106
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640

 

107
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,949

lots 4 8

111
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,390
16 32 64
and 2 yeah so it's 2 to the power of 7

112
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
and 2 yeah so it's 2 to the power of 7
 

113
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,430

so what's this in in binary one

114
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
so what's this in in binary one
 

115
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,949
so what's this in in binary one
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero

zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
 

117
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,070
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
so how many ones one

118
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
so how many ones one
 

119
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,070
so how many ones one
yeah you see it do you get it yeah

120
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
yeah you see it do you get it yeah
 

121
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,350
yeah you see it do you get it yeah
do you understand yeah if it's a power

122
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
do you understand yeah if it's a power
 

123
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,750
do you understand yeah if it's a power

the ones how do we
 

153
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,750
the ones how do we
count them um so look this is binary

154
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
count them um so look this is binary
 

155
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,869
count them um so look this is binary
uh 1011 okay so suppose this is

156
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
uh 1011 okay so suppose this is
 

157

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600

 

169
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,150

chord okay count one okay one number

170
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
chord okay count one okay one number
 

171
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,590
chord okay count one okay one number
yeah look let's say answer equals zero

172
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
yeah look let's say answer equals zero
 

173
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,150
yeah look let's say answer equals zero
okay

174
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
okay
 

175
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,590
okay
okay y

176
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
okay y
 

177
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,870
okay y
and bigger than zero

178
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
and bigger than zero
 

179
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,189
and bigger than zero
y n is bigger than zero

180
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199

 

181
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,710

plus equals look n is

182
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
plus equals look n is
 

183
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,070
plus equals look n is
we want to know the the right most digit

184
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
we want to know the the right most digit
 

185
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,110
we want to know the the right most digit
if it's uh if it's one

186
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
if it's uh if it's one
 

187
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,230
if it's uh if it's one
it's a odd number right if it's

188
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
it's a odd number right if it's
 

189
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,909
it's a odd number right if it's
zero it's an even number right the

190
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
zero it's an even number right the
 

191
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,430
zero it's an even number right the
binary yeah yeah

192
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
binary yeah yeah
 

193
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,550
binary yeah yeah
for example three is is one one right

194
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
for example three is is one one right
 

195
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,150
for example three is is one one right
and four is one zero zero so in finally

196
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
and four is one zero zero so in finally
 

197
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,469
and four is one zero zero so in finally
if the rightmost speed is 0 is all

198
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
if the rightmost speed is 0 is all
 

199
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,150
if the rightmost speed is 0 is all
even number if it's one is all number

200
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
even number if it's one is all number
 

201
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,430
even number if it's one is all number
so answer equals n

202
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
so answer equals n
 

203
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,950
so answer equals n
and one yeah the rightmost digit yeah

204
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
and one yeah the rightmost digit yeah
 

205
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,670
and one yeah the rightmost digit yeah
am right yeah now i i counted the

206
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
am right yeah now i i counted the
 

207
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,670
am right yeah now i i counted the
driver's stitch if it's one and any one

208
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
driver's stitch if it's one and any one
 

209
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,550
driver's stitch if it's one and any one
if it's zero at

210
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
if it's zero at
 

211
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,950
if it's zero at
zero right now what should i do i should

212
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
zero right now what should i do i should
 

213
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,029
zero right now what should i do i should
remove the right most digit all right

214
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
remove the right most digit all right
 

215
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,070
remove the right most digit all right
yeah so how do we remove that one more

216
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
yeah so how do we remove that one more
 

217
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,189
yeah so how do we remove that one more
digit

218
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199

 

219
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,670

and shift to to one position to the

220
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
and shift to to one position to the
 

221
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,469
and shift to to one position to the
right right

222
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
right right
 

223
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,469
right right
yeah look this one this is the number

224
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
yeah look this one this is the number
 

225
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,469
yeah look this one this is the number
fifty fifty equals one

226
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
fifty fifty equals one
 

227
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,670
fifty fifty equals one
means that i shift one and i remove the

228
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
means that i shift one and i remove the
 

229
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,790
means that i shift one and i remove the
five yeah one five

230
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
five yeah one five
 

231
00:05:50,800 --> 00:06:05,510
five yeah one five
return

232
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520

 

233
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,029

yeah yeah okay

234
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
yeah yeah okay
 

235
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,390
yeah yeah okay
okay so do you still remember what we

236
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
okay so do you still remember what we
 

237
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,029
okay so do you still remember what we
talked about

238
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
talked about
 

239
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,510
talked about
a few days ago to check the power of two

240
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
a few days ago to check the power of two
 

241
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,110
a few days ago to check the power of two
the very good uh

242
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
the very good uh
 

243
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,710
the very good uh
the the last method we get divided by

244
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
the the last method we get divided by
 

245
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,189
the the last method we get divided by
takes every time until it reaches one

246
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
takes every time until it reaches one
 

247
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,270
takes every time until it reaches one
yeah yeah another one look because it's

248
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
yeah yeah another one look because it's
 

249
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,710
yeah yeah another one look because it's
two it's power of two

250
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
two it's power of two
 

251
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,270
two it's power of two
in binary all right and finally if it's

252
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
in binary all right and finally if it's
 

253
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,670
in binary all right and finally if it's
a power two is one followed by a few

254
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
a power two is one followed by a few
 

255
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,070
a power two is one followed by a few
zero

256
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
zero
 

257
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,590
zero
yeah actually quite a lot yeah

258
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
yeah actually quite a lot yeah
 

259
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,390
yeah actually quite a lot yeah
at least one yeah so if it's power two

260
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
at least one yeah so if it's power two
 

261
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,309
at least one yeah so if it's power two
it finally means that one

262
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
it finally means that one
 

263
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,430
it finally means that one
followed by a few zeros yes yeah look

264
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
followed by a few zeros yes yeah look
 

265
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,150
followed by a few zeros yes yeah look
one is two to the power of zero 2 to the

266
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
one is two to the power of zero 2 to the
 

267
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,029
one is two to the power of zero 2 to the
power 1 is 1

268
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
power 1 is 1
 

269
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,790
power 1 is 1
0 2 to the power 2 is 1 0 0 yeah

270
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
0 2 to the power 2 is 1 0 0 yeah
 

271
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,710
0 2 to the power 2 is 1 0 0 yeah
2 to the power 3 1 0 0 0 okay yes

272
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
2 to the power 3 1 0 0 0 okay yes
 

273
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,189
2 to the power 3 1 0 0 0 okay yes
so now we want if we want what's this

274
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
so now we want if we want what's this
 

275
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,230
so now we want if we want what's this
and n minus one what's this

276
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
and n minus one what's this
 

277
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,710
and n minus one what's this
n minus look i'll give you one example

278
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
n minus look i'll give you one example
 

279
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,350
n minus look i'll give you one example
okay

280
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
okay
 

281
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,390
okay
if it's binary one one one one this is

282
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
if it's binary one one one one this is
 

283
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,350
if it's binary one one one one this is
binary yeah

284
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
binary yeah
 

285
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,790
binary yeah
and n minus one is one

286
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
and n minus one is one
 

287
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,950
and n minus one is one
zero one one one into this end remember

288
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
zero one one one into this end remember
 

289
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,029
zero one one one into this end remember
this n means that zero and one is one

290
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:24,039
this n means that zero and one is one
 

291
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:30,309
this n means that zero and one is one
zero zero zero zero one and zero yellow

292
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
zero zero zero zero one and zero yellow
 

293
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,430
zero zero zero zero one and zero yellow
yeah

294
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
yeah
 

295
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,110
yeah
one and one one yeah so do you see

296
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
one and one one yeah so do you see
 

297
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,309
one and one one yeah so do you see
n and n minus one you because you will

298
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
n and n minus one you because you will
 

299
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,430
n and n minus one you because you will
change

300
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
change
 

301
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,550
change
from one one zero zero to one zero zero

happened
71 well if it's 15 you'll be too zero to

326
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
71 well if it's 15 you'll be too zero to
 

327
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,070
71 well if it's 15 you'll be too zero to
one

328
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
one
 

329
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,869
one
if there's no one there's only one

330
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
if there's no one there's only one
 

331
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,070
if there's no one there's only one
there's only one

332
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
there's only one
 

333
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,309
there's only one
left okay i'll give you another example

334
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
left okay i'll give you another example
 

335
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,270
left okay i'll give you another example
right one o

336
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
right one o
 

337
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,629
right one o
zero zero zero yeah yeah minus one is

338
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
zero zero zero yeah yeah minus one is
 

339
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,070
zero zero zero yeah yeah minus one is
one zero zero one one and you end it

340
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
one zero zero one one and you end it
 

341
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,990
one zero zero one one and you end it
so what is the equal zero zero zero zero

342
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
so what is the equal zero zero zero zero
 

343
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,029
so what is the equal zero zero zero zero
one so what happened from this to this

344
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
one so what happened from this to this
 

345
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,469
one so what happened from this to this
yes

346
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479

 

347
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,630

we moved which one

348
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640

 

349
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,630

what what is that one the right most one

350
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
what what is that one the right most one
 

351
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,670
what what is that one the right most one
yes yeah

352
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
yes yeah
 

353
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,190
yes yeah
so n and n minus one means that

354
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
so n and n minus one means that
 

355
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,470
so n and n minus one means that
i take away the right most one

356
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
i take away the right most one
 

357
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,870
i take away the right most one
okay look i take which is the rightmost

358
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
okay look i take which is the rightmost
 

359
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,750
okay look i take which is the rightmost
one here

360
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
one here
 

361
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,070
one here
i take away it and make it zero okay for

362
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
i take away it and make it zero okay for
 

363
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,150
i take away it and make it zero okay for
example like another one

364
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160

 

365
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,150

okay and and and one n

366
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
okay and and and one n
 

367
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,190
okay and and and one n
minus one is one zero one zero zero one

368
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
minus one is one zero one zero zero one
 

369
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,829
minus one is one zero one zero zero one
yeah

370
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
yeah
 

371
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,910
yeah
you end at zero and one zero one and

372
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
you end at zero and one zero one and
 

373
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,030
you end at zero and one zero one and
zero zero

374
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
zero zero
 

375
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,310
zero zero
zero one zero one so look the rightmost

376
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
zero one zero one so look the rightmost
 

377
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,350
zero one zero one so look the rightmost
one is

378
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
one is
 

379
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,470
one is
taken out yeah so we can call this every

380
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
taken out yeah so we can call this every
 

381
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,230
taken out yeah so we can call this every
time we take away the rightmost one we

382
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
time we take away the rightmost one we
 

383
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,509
time we take away the rightmost one we
increment one

384
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
increment one
 

385
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,110
increment one
don't cut it yes so yeah

386
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
don't cut it yes so yeah
 

387
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,949
don't cut it yes so yeah
so look answer yeah plus equals

388
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
so look answer yeah plus equals
 

389
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,990
so look answer yeah plus equals
one yeah and then what how should i

390
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
one yeah and then what how should i
 

391
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,070
one yeah and then what how should i
change here

392
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
change here
 

393
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,190
change here
here i take away the the rightmost one

394
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
here i take away the the rightmost one
 

395
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,509
here i take away the the rightmost one
is

396
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
is
 

397
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,030
is
n equals n and one

398
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
n equals n and one
 

399
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,790
n equals n and one
yeah whatever yeah

400
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800

 

401
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,350

what did i just said this is take away

402
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
what did i just said this is take away
 

403
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,310
what did i just said this is take away
the right most one

404
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
the right most one
 

405
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,710
the right most one
n minus one yes look at it i added one

406
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
n minus one yes look at it i added one
 

407
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,190
n minus one yes look at it i added one
i added one and i take away the

408
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
i added one and i take away the
 

409
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,829
i added one and i take away the
rightmost one and here it's yellow right

410
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
rightmost one and here it's yellow right
 

411
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,590
rightmost one and here it's yellow right
one here which one is better which one

412
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
one here which one is better which one
 

413
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,670
one here which one is better which one
is faster

414
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
is faster
 

415
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,520
is faster
what's the complexity

416
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:04,530
what's the complexity
 

417
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:10,389
what's the complexity

419
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,269

so if n is is unlimited you know if it

420
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
so if n is is unlimited you know if it
 

421
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,030
so if n is is unlimited you know if it
could be a thousand

422
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
could be a thousand
 

423
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,490
could be a thousand
i won a thousand digits

424
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:18,500
i won a thousand digits
 

425
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,310
i won a thousand digits

zeros
 

431
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,110

yeah it depends on the number of the

432
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
yeah it depends on the number of the
 

433
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,590
yeah it depends on the number of the
it depends on the number of the size in

number eight how many digits in binary
 

457
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,550
number eight how many digits in binary
is zero one one one zero zero

458
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
is zero one one one zero zero
 

459
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,910
is zero one one one zero zero
zero yeah even sixteen

460
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
zero yeah even sixteen
 

461
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,350
zero yeah even sixteen
if sixteen is one zero zero zero

462
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
if sixteen is one zero zero zero
 

463
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,389
if sixteen is one zero zero zero
it was n is what how many digits look 16

464
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
it was n is what how many digits look 16
 

465
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,630
it was n is what how many digits look 16
is five four eight is four

466
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
is five four eight is four
 

467
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,150
is five four eight is four
right thirty two is six

468
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
right thirty two is six
 

469
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,389
right thirty two is six
yeah roughly you have one followed by

470
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
yeah roughly you have one followed by
 

471
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,590
yeah roughly you have one followed by
six years

472
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
six years
 

473
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,990
six years
okay so look if it's 2 to the power of

474
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
okay so look if it's 2 to the power of
 

475
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,150
okay so look if it's 2 to the power of
n this number is 2 to the power and how

476
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
n this number is 2 to the power and how
 

477
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,670
n this number is 2 to the power and how
many digits

478
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680
many digits
 

479
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,590
many digits
if this number is 2 to the power m how

480
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
if this number is 2 to the power m how
 

481
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,990
if this number is 2 to the power m how
many digits

482
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000

 

483
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,509

and plus 1 digit yeah that's it yes

484
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
and plus 1 digit yeah that's it yes
 

485
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,509
and plus 1 digit yeah that's it yes
because look if it's 2 to the power of 3

486
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
because look if it's 2 to the power of 3
 

487
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,030
because look if it's 2 to the power of 3
then it's four digits yeah

488
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
then it's four digits yeah
 

489
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,110
then it's four digits yeah
2 to the power of 6 is 32 right

490
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
2 to the power of 6 is 32 right
 

491
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,629
2 to the power of 6 is 32 right
is is 1 followed by 6 digits yeah

492
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
is is 1 followed by 6 digits yeah
 

493
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,750
is is 1 followed by 6 digits yeah
all right so if a number is n then how

494
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
all right so if a number is n then how
 

495
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,470
all right so if a number is n then how
many digits

496
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
many digits
 

497
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,550
many digits
is log n yeah two base two log n yeah

498
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
is log n yeah two base two log n yeah
 

499
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,269
is log n yeah two base two log n yeah
yes yeah so the complexity is not n

500
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
yes yeah so the complexity is not n
 

501
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,590
yes yeah so the complexity is not n
right

502
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
right
 

503
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:28,069
right
log base to n yeah i'm right yes

504
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079

 

505
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,110

n is the limit of range for example like

506
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
n is the limit of range for example like
 

507
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,150
n is the limit of range for example like
if it's a

508
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
if it's a
 

509
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,190
if it's a
32 bit if it's the maximum is 32 it

510
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
32 bit if it's the maximum is 32 it
 

511
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,990
32 bit if it's the maximum is 32 it
means that

512
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
means that
 

513
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,910
means that
the at both this this digi in binary 32

514
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
the at both this this digi in binary 32
 

515
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,949
the at both this this digi in binary 32
bits

516
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
bits
 

517
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,389
bits
then if we know the size is limited

518
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
then if we know the size is limited
 

519
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,310
then if we know the size is limited
it's a one right constant because it

520
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
it's a one right constant because it
 

521
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,509
it's a one right constant because it
does not grow

522
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
does not grow
 

523
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,629
does not grow
yeah yes yeah but

524
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
yeah yes yeah but
 

525
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,949
yeah yes yeah but
this depends if i say n is unbounded if

526
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
this depends if i say n is unbounded if
 

527
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,269
this depends if i say n is unbounded if
it could be any any length then you have

528
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,279
it could be any any length then you have
 

529
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:55,750
it could be any any length then you have
to say

530
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
to say
 

531
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,350
to say
it's long or logan okay

532
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
it's long or logan okay
 

533
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,910
it's long or logan okay
okay so in 2017 yeah in python look

534
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
okay so in 2017 yeah in python look
 

535
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,629
okay so in 2017 yeah in python look
in python and we can use this function

536
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
in python and we can use this function
 

537
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,750
in python and we can use this function
pin

538
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
pin
 

539
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,670
pin
binary yeah if pin five

540
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
binary yeah if pin five
 

541
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,710
binary yeah if pin five
yeah inside you will return

542
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
yeah inside you will return
 

543
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,069
yeah inside you will return
your return string like i i think is

544
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
your return string like i i think is
 

545
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,190
your return string like i i think is
uh is what

546
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
uh is what
 

547
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,710
uh is what
one zero zero

548
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
one zero zero
 

549
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,829
one zero zero
one yeah no no no one one zero one

550
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
one yeah no no no one one zero one
 

551
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,150
one yeah no no no one one zero one
yeah i think there are two characters in

552
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
yeah i think there are two characters in
 

553
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,350
yeah i think there are two characters in
front okay

554
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360
front okay
 

555
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,590
front okay
so if i turn it into string then i can

556
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
so if i turn it into string then i can
 

557
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,269
so if i turn it into string then i can
count how many of of one

558
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
count how many of of one
 

559
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,750
count how many of of one
that's another way of doing it right

560
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:37,760
that's another way of doing it right
 

561
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,829
that's another way of doing it right
yeah you can say okay four

562
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
yeah you can say okay four
 

563
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,949
yeah you can say okay four
four i in pin right

564
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
four i in pin right
 

565
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,750
four i in pin right
answer equals zero and then you can say

566
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
answer equals zero and then you can say
 

567
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,470
answer equals zero and then you can say
if

568
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
if
 

569
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,069
if
i equal equals one then

570
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
i equal equals one then
 

571
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,310
i equal equals one then
answer plus equals one return answer

572
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
answer plus equals one return answer
 

573
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,949
answer plus equals one return answer
yeah you get it

574
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
yeah you get it
 

575
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,750
yeah you get it
yeah first of all i converted to binary

576
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
yeah first of all i converted to binary
 

577
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,670
yeah first of all i converted to binary
and then

578
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
and then
 

579
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,389
and then
yeah defined yeah pretty different okay

580
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
yeah defined yeah pretty different okay
 

581
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,030
yeah defined yeah pretty different okay
so but this

582
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
so but this
 

583
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,870
so but this
is always lower this is more important

584
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
is always lower this is more important
 

585
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,790
is always lower this is more important
okay so what does this do okay

586
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
okay so what does this do okay
 

587
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,150
okay so what does this do okay
i'm going to erase it can you write it

588
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
i'm going to erase it can you write it
 

589
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,310
i'm going to erase it can you write it
come on the most important thing what's

590
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
come on the most important thing what's
 

591
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,829
come on the most important thing what's
here

592
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
here
 

593
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,830
here
n and equals

594
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:18,840

 

595
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:42,829

[Music]

596
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839

 

597
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,430

n okay okay

598
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
n okay okay
 

599
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,629
n okay okay
equal a n n minus one yeah

600
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
equal a n n minus one yeah
 

601
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,990
equal a n n minus one yeah
okay so this is actually look and

602
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
okay so this is actually look and
 

603
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,069
okay so this is actually look and
f equals n minus one is actually equals

604
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
f equals n minus one is actually equals
 

605
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,150
f equals n minus one is actually equals
n equals n and minus one okay

606
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
n equals n and minus one okay
 

607
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,509
n equals n and minus one okay
yeah do you get it yeah it's okay look

608
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519
yeah do you get it yeah it's okay look
 

609
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,629
yeah do you get it yeah it's okay look
do you get it i i i know this and when

610
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
do you get it i i i know this and when
 

611
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,790
do you get it i i i know this and when
you roll this this is short for that

612
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
you roll this this is short for that
 

613
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,750
you roll this this is short for that
it's like look away a plus equals b what

614
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
it's like look away a plus equals b what
 

615
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,470
it's like look away a plus equals b what
does the equal

616
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
does the equal
 

617
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,509
does the equal
is e is the same as a equals a plus b

618
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
is e is the same as a equals a plus b
 

619
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,870
is e is the same as a equals a plus b
yeah all right like

620
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
yeah all right like
 

621
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,030
yeah all right like
n and equals 2 what does it equal

622
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
n and equals 2 what does it equal
 

623
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,629
n and equals 2 what does it equal
what does it is it's the same as what

624
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
what does it is it's the same as what
 

625
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,870
what does it is it's the same as what
and i know what

626
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:32,880

 

627
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,389

and and
