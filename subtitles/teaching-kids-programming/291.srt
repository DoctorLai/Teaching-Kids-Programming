1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,880
hello

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,040
hello mr mrwan how are you good okay

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,760
today we're going to talk about the old

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,320
power gym yeah what's perignon

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,920
the word when universes is the same can

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:21,279
you tell me an example race

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,279
car and any more i got that bob's place

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,160
yeah bob okay i'll pop yeah bob is it

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,960
bob okay yeah

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,480
how do we check it by the way reverse it

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,239
yeah we can reverse it and check it with

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,559
the thumb yeah we reverse it

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,079
that's one thing oh we can use two

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,600
pointer thing and check carry to buy a

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,120
character until the meat in the window

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,200
yeah yeah

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,800
yeah that's one easy way okay so today

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,680
we want to talk about oddparent what

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,810
does it mean so given a string like uh

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,760
you know let's give it a string a b

21
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,039
[Music]

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,879
let's just give this a string for

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,160
example like a bob

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,320
okay bob yay we want to find out the

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,879
soft strings the pen interest actually

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,439
okay so we uh any

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,159
uh what's what's the substring

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,159
substrings

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,840
what's sub strings both

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,040
what's substring sometimes a string

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,920
yeah which is what stop sensing how many

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,840
substrings can we have for the pop

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,479
one two three six

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,479
what are those

35
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:41,640
[Music]

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,640
oh

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,040
okay including an empty string is the

38
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,759
string is also kind of substring yeah a

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,520
special subject so it's a six six

40
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,719
section so among of those what uh which

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,680
are the pattern zones the substrings

42
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,959
how many of those are such things

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,160
this one is

44
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,520
yeah

45
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,959
okay this one maybe yes this one is yeah

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,360
single character

47
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,200
character right this one no right this

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,560
one no this one yes right

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,879
yeah

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,360
a layer any even

51
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,800
parent drums so the the the side the

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,680
lens is even are there any even present

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,319
here

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,280
no there oh yeah this this can tell you

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,360
uh

56
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,360
no

57
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,440
[Music]

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,440
okay

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,560
okay so you understand so we're given a

60
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,040
string okay so our task is to find out

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,800
if there are any pendulum which are the

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,120
size of

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,640
which are all uh you know all the sides

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,319
of the

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,200
peninsula uh

66
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,400
even

67
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,920
all the soil

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,040
okay

69
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,480
uh

70
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,920
okay okay do i make myself clear yeah so

71
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,680
given a string

72
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,319
we want to find

73
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,000
or to check if all

74
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,560
palindrome okay first of all it has to

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,799
be plain syndrome paddington

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,799
soft strings

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,319
uh odd off size okay all size

78
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,239
size so it doesn't make it doesn't mean

79
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,920
that there can't be

80
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,840
any challenges that are even sized okay

81
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,840
for example like what

82
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,840
c

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,760
a c okay so

84
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,040
for this one

85
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,319
for this one

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,319
what's that

87
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,519
can you find any panning drone that that

88
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,319
is uh even size um

89
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,799
yeah

90
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,840
cat and oh yeah that's it

91
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,319
is uh

92
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,159
all size okay so what we want we also

93
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,519
check if all the planets in substring

94
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,320
are all sides

95
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,840
any example any idea

96
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,759
um

97
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,000
any idea the first thing comes to mind

98
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,800
is what a palliative that has

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,199
an odd number we want to find out if all

100
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,520
the terms on substring are outside so if

101
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,680
they are even sides we need to say false

102
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,080
otherwise we will say yes

103
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,120
so for this one we said true false

104
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,360
because we find out that

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,160
these are even right but for this cac

106
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,080
we find we said yes because all the

107
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,919
subs uh particular substrings are

108
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,720
awesome

109
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,560
and this is even size so it's it's not

110
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,840
right

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,840
do i make

112
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,440
so you just need to find the paradigm

113
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,400
that has

114
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,680
an odd number of letters

115
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,680
we want to find out if there are

116
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
problems on that are even sides right if

117
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,320
they are even then we just return

118
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,479
immediately right twelves yeah okay so

119
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,960
any idea how can we do this this well

120
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,160
this is clever thing yeah we can prove

121
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,639
always

122
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
how do we proof us all the substrings in

123
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,600
what was the term complexity if we put

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,600
force all the substances

125
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,880
yeah if we prove us the substring how

126
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,880
what's the time complexity

127
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,720
oh and

128
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,680
4x square yeah because look if

129
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,039
a b c d okay what's the subject if we

130
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,360
have we have a left left pointer when we

131
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,400
make sure the left we we have another

132
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,120
loop to go uh to determine uh the right

133
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,120
pointer right okay okay so let's do it

134
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,880
and now let's

135
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,720
define

136
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,639
oh

137
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,800
odd parent okay

138
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,280
we want to find out all paddington all

139
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,840
the prince's substrings are all sized

140
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,120
okay let's say s

141
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,960
and equals length as well

142
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,639
for

143
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,280
i

144
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,560
in range

145
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,360
and right

146
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,120
right the eye is the left right right

147
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,600
yeah and then the right what should we

148
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,600
start with the right for j in range

149
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,240
whenever

150
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,600
i is the left j is what so it is from i

151
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,759
to n right yeah yeah and then we want to

152
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,520
try how do we check the parameters let's

153
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,319
say we we check the function check

154
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,240
pressure actually we want it here we can

155
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,240
just simply we cannot return this look

156
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,809
[Music]

157
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:07,039
yeah like i j equals zero zero right

158
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,160
zero

159
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,639
then s minus one and y

160
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,039
i smaller than j

161
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,599
if s i

162
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,800
not equal sj

163
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,680
then we do time false right

164
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,639
okay

165
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,560
otherwise i plus equals one and j minus

166
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,000
equals one right and then return true

167
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,599
got it

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,800
doesn't make sense

169
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,599
yeah

170
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,560
yeah

171
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,960
all right

172
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,400
look at me what am i doing here what's

173
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,400
this part doing here can you tell me

174
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,639
what's this part doing here

175
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,479
what does this mean

176
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,960
so

177
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,960
technically is

178
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,639
i know you know it i was just checking

179
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,479
if you're paying attention okay

180
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,280
yeah yeah okay

181
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,680
now look if checking and then look look

182
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,000
what's the what's that if the index from

183
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,240
goes from i to j inclusive okay so

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,080
what's the string what's the string the

185
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,000
string the substring okay at the same

186
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,000
string equals one s start from i to j

187
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,960
plus one right all right

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,120
right

189
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,520
if

190
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,319
if we find the pending jump

191
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,319
if this is a parent drum and it's

192
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,560
offside it's even size right so

193
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,200
how do we check its events as uh outside

194
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,159
uh even sorry

195
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,560
no no no the i to j i to j inclusive how

196
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,120
many sides of this how many sides from i

197
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,839
to j how many characters are there

198
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,160
if j minus i

199
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,399
plus one right then that's how many

200
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,560
characters from i to j

201
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,040
if this end one yeah or modular two yeah

202
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,040
model

203
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,600
equals zero it means this is the even

204
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,360
number and you check this st is the

205
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,760
parent zone we return

206
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,440
we return to return fourth right

207
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,440
return first

208
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,399
and then what what's missing here return

209
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
one

210
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,680
turn

211
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,440
what's missing after two yeah whether

212
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,000
what's the time constraint okay what's

213
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,980
the terms number three

214
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
what's the time complexity come on

215
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,480
[Applause]

216
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,880
square

217
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,360
this is one double places one loop and

218
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,440
then we need to check out what

219
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,480
we're done because the here

220
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,120
here is another end right

221
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,640
however we can improve this right we can

222
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,200
increase

223
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,920
all right look at me please right

224
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,120
do we actually need to check the go you

225
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,720
know go through the these right we can

226
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,800
get rid of these right because we are

227
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,959
now we need to first of all check if the

228
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,399
length is an even number but instead of

229
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,640
this we can do this look i plus one we

230
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,200
go through the the right would be l is i

231
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,800
plus one to n and then we put a step

232
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
here

233
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
yeah

234
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,680
what's this two mean

235
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,360
wait i don't see

236
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,519
i plus one to n j and two yeah so every

237
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,760
time we skip two because uh

238
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,519
even number x two is also even number

239
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,600
right yeah

240
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,320
yeah yeah i know we can get rid of which

241
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,839
parts

242
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
that one which

243
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,079
we always want to check we don't want to

244
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,440
get rid of this because we already know

245
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,079
this is an even number skipping at 2.

246
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,880
come on so we can get rid of that right

247
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,120
right so it will be easier right

248
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,680
let's all incubate it's not very good

249
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,839
okay so how can we improve it

250
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,920
okay so can you tell me what's the

251
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,200
what's the can you give me a few

252
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,959
patterns which are even sized pink

253
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,480
anymore anymore

254
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,800
anymore

255
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,800
um

256
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,920
um

257
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,399
any more

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,040
a let me think let me see

259
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,200
a race card no okay

260
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,880
what else

261
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,480
hmm let me think let me think let me

262
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,160
think bad this is not this is odd

263
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,500
what else

264
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
um

265
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,360
[Music]

266
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,440
anymore

267
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,680
you said this

268
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,680
huh

269
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,399
come on give me one more example which

270
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,000
is pendulum and even

271
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,000
okay

272
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
okay

273
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,959
okay so what what's

274
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,959
i got one more okay what's that

275
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,240
already okay

276
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,079
listen to me if it's a peninsula if it's

277
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,000
even side what does it mean we can fold

278
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,200
it right we can fold it so what does it

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,279
mean

280
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,519
look we can fold it in the middle yeah

281
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,720
then we can fold it yeah

282
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,720
and then what does this mean

283
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,560
there are two continuous characters

284
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,040
right

285
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,120
yeah isn't just like a mirror it's like

286
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,079
a mineral so that the these two

287
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,440
characters there should be if it's not

288
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,800
like a mirror

289
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,440
at least

290
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,440
everywhere

291
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,800
this is a mirror

292
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,800
okay and then

293
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,079
that's what's in there okay i see what

294
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,079
it means

295
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,590
what i was saying is that if it's a evil

296
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,680
laser even padding drum right

297
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,639
[Music]

298
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,800
i rely on for the last time come on yes

299
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,120
if it's even fair enough

300
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,120
there are two characters which needs to

301
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
be the same right yeah

302
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,920
and what does that mean if the original

303
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,519
question if they are original if there

304
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,600
is a string we want to find out if all

305
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,560
the paragraphs us

306
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,880
yeah

307
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,079
parents and substitutes are

308
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,360
er

309
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,279
what does it mean

310
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,000
what does it mean so we want to check

311
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,560
for if they are

312
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,440
if they are too continuous

313
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,399
that

314
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,639
if it is then it's false right

315
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,639
oh yes am i right yes

316
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,600
hurry up

317
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,440
can you repeat what i'm saying

318
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,440
huh can you repeat what i'm saying

319
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,240
what i'm saying is that if they are even

320
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,000
number pendulum if a pendulum is even

321
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,600
number the they they they will be two

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,760
continuous consecutive yeah consecutive

323
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,519
consecutive same letters all right

324
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,519
yeah yeah

325
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,199
okay so the original question is can we

326
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,320
find a peninsula

327
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,639
can uh earlier or all the peninsula such

328
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,120
students are outside

329
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,320
so we can check we can check if there

330
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,040
are consecutive send letters if they are

331
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,360
it means that there should be a parent

332
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,199
which is even says am right

333
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,639
okay so we can turn original question

334
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,639
into this this question am i right yeah

335
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,079
okay so how do we check it

336
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,040
um take it like this how do we check it

337
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,880
okay so

338
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,880
i'm going to write it quickly and you

339
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,399
can tell me if if the original question

340
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,760
is yes or no right

341
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:53,680
a a c b e f g okay original question if

342
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,120
they are or if all the planing

343
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,079
substrings are

344
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,600
numbers okay so what is this one

345
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,360
come on look at it

346
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,199
it's not why why it's not because

347
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,180
because i guess

348
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:12,959
three three one odd sorry so sorry what

349
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,560
[Music]

350
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,560
one

351
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,240
yeah but we the original question is

352
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,800
that we want to find out if all the

353
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,040
products on such string are all numbers

354
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,320
yeah okay okay another one just to make

355
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,600
sure you understand

356
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,560
c e f g

357
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,800
h i that's enough yes

358
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,360
two of us three

359
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,360
thousand folks

360
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,800
if you say false you need to tell me

361
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,120
which which two are the even size no i

362
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,040
see e f g h i

363
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,959
no no the pentagon needs to be pennies

364
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,320
no i don't think i don't think there is

365
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,839
one

366
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,040
then it's true right yeah yeah okay okay

367
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
c e f

368
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,480
so the question is we need to check if

369
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,839
they have two consecutive right because

370
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,120
if they are if i just say if they are

371
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,040
like this yeah there's only one unique

372
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,120
yeah yeah yeah that's that's right if

373
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,920
they are even pending drums what does it

374
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,000
mean

375
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,000
if they are even pendulum what does it

376
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,800
mean it means that it's a

377
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,600
no yeah it's false and then

378
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,920
there must be a two consecutive same

379
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,360
letter right to make up even parents all

380
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,440
right because

381
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
got it this is the most important thing

382
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,800
to remember do you understand

383
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,800
yeah yeah no yeah

384
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,079
these two kinds of planning this one is

385
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,320
even this one is all number right

386
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,959
yeah all number there's only one single

387
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,639
in the meter but even size what does it

388
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,480
mean there are two

389
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,279
in the middle

390
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,199
there are two in the middle consecutive

391
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,040
got it

392
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,720
okay let's try this

393
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,640
define

394
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,640
check let's just do a check s

395
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,039
for

396
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,000
i

397
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,240
in

398
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,079
range

399
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,480
land n

400
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,280
minus one huh go n1

401
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
look

402
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,559
if what

403
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,400
if s i

404
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,679
equal equal our

405
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,360
s i what next one is one what what's s

406
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,120
what's next next character current

407
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,640
character next character what should i

408
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,200
put here

409
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,200
if equals

410
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,720
because return false because there are

411
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,320
two consecutive letters then there must

412
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,480
be even

413
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,200
turning them right and otherwise we

414
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,520
return true

415
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,559
okay this should go here okay let's go

416
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,240
here

417
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,240
what's the time complexity for this one

418
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,400
what's the original first approach we're

419
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,400
talking about on n squared

420
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,600
yeah as i if i want to

421
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,760
change this s i s minus one what should

422
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,400
i do if i need to check the previous one

423
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,760
how would you like to change this

424
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,080
not plus one

425
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,640
what should i change here

426
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:31,440
uh we shall change we're changing here

427
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,200
to start with one right yeah up to

428
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,799
length n right

429
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,039
yeah okay

430
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,280
can you listen to us

431
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,720
okay now we can write this in one line

432
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,039
right we can just do this return all of

433
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,400
o means what everything yeah

434
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,840
okay

435
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,799
s i

436
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,280
equal

437
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,480
s i plus one

438
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,520
for

439
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
i

440
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,840
in

441
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,840
range

442
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,360
s minus one right because we we

443
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,919
approximate we need to check it plus one

444
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,440
can you put it back please

445
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,679
okay i'm going to erase this and then

446
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,480
you tell me yeah

447
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:25,000
come on come on just right what just

448
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,000
okay just do this i have

449
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,009
[Music]

450
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
have you paid attention to whatever it

451
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,200
says here look if s we want to check if

452
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,640
the two characters are the same right

453
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,360
yeah

454
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,200
so if what come on

455
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,200
if they are the same

456
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,679
yeah

457
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,400
unless we turn red false

458
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,240
okay okay look if i change these two

459
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,280
plus ones what should i check what

460
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,280
should i check check here

461
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,950
can you pay attention come on if i pop

462
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,059
to this first one what should i do here

463
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,059
[Music]

464
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,000
from zero

465
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,880
and minus one right this is the same

466
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,240
thing

467
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,000
and i'm going to write the one liner

468
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,480
again okay o

469
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,520
means everything needs to be the same as

470
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,880
i

471
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,640
equal equal s i plus 1

472
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,159
4

473
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,400
yeah for

474
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,720
i in range

475
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,960
then you're looking

476
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,280
and i'm looking at this lens s you're

477
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,280
looking this is less sorry let's ask

478
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,520
quick

479
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,080
so what does it mean we want to check if

480
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,559
s i equals the neighboring characters

481
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,159
are the same for the range i is for the

482
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,440
range up to

483
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,000
the length

484
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,840
minus one right and everything all so

485
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,240
this is the same okay the time

486
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,280
complexity is on the space complexity is

487
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,360
what

488
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,440
what's the speed conversely

489
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,679
one because we're not using any space

490
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,679
okay that's it for today good job

491
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,679
bye
