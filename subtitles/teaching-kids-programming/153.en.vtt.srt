hey hello mr ryan
yeah remember yesterday we talked about

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,440
yeah remember yesterday we talked about
 

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,269
yeah remember yesterday we talked about
the energy tree

6
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:07,279
the energy tree
 

7
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,710
the energy tree
right so can you tell me what's an

8
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,720
right so can you tell me what's an
 

9
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,709
right so can you tell me what's an
animal tree

10
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:10,719
animal tree
 

11
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,629
animal tree
i know it's all a tree you know it's

12
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:12,639
i know it's all a tree you know it's
 

13
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,390
i know it's all a tree you know it's
just a tree okay

14
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
just a tree okay
 

15
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,230
just a tree okay
so you know we know the final retrieve

16
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
so you know we know the final retrieve
 

17
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,230
so you know we know the final retrieve
what's final three eric

18
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
what's final three eric
 

19
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,429
what's final three eric
a binary tree has uh

20
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
a binary tree has uh
 

21
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,750
a binary tree has uh
two two children yeah two two at least

22
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
two two children yeah two two at least
 

23
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,830
two two children yeah two two at least
one parent yeah two children

24
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
one parent yeah two children
 

25
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,229
one parent yeah two children
maximum one parent the lou does not have

26
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
maximum one parent the lou does not have
 

27
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:34,950
maximum one parent the lou does not have
parents right

28
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960
parents right
 

29
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,750
parents right
the kid does not have any children right

30
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
the kid does not have any children right
 

31
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,389
the kid does not have any children right
if

32
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
if
 

33
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,190
if
if we remove the binary when it becomes

34
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
if we remove the binary when it becomes
 

35
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,350
if we remove the binary when it becomes
the energy so basically the tree

36
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
the energy so basically the tree
 

37
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,549
the energy so basically the tree
can have come up at most a few you know

38
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
can have come up at most a few you know
 

39
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,270
can have come up at most a few you know
you can have a many many children not

40
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
you can have a many many children not
 

41
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,910
you can have a many many children not
except

42
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
except
 

43
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,270
except
not necessarily limited to right right

44
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280

 

45
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,150

so do you still remember how we define

46
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
so do you still remember how we define
 

47
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,470
so do you still remember how we define
the

48
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
the
 

49
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,670
the
energy trees right class

50
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
energy trees right class
 

51
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,429
energy trees right class
now all right can we leave that thing

52
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
now all right can we leave that thing
 

53
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,630
now all right can we leave that thing
later yes please

54
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
later yes please
 

55
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,450
later yes please
don't be cubed

56
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:13,460

define in int

60
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
define in int
 

61
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,910
define in int
is the constructor and then we have a

62
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
is the constructor and then we have a
 

63
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,950
is the constructor and then we have a
value for the

64
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
value for the
 

65
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,670
value for the
note of the current value and the

66
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
note of the current value and the
 

67
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,950
note of the current value and the
children right

68
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
children right
 

69
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,710
children right
so you can have many children so these

70
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
so you can have many children so these
 

71
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,789
so you can have many children so these
children is the list of notes

72
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
children is the list of notes
 

73
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,830
children is the list of notes
yes yes

74
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840

 

75
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,429

okay so look at the constructor self

76
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
okay so look at the constructor self
 

77
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,630
okay so look at the constructor self
stock value will be equal to value and

78
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
stock value will be equal to value and
 

79
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,830
stock value will be equal to value and
self stop children will be equal to

80
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
self stop children will be equal to
 

81
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,190
self stop children will be equal to
children right

82
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
children right
 

83
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,190
children right
yeah all right

84
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
yeah all right
 

85
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,429
yeah all right
okay so look if i have these

86
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
okay so look if i have these
 

87
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,550
okay so look if i have these
two three

00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
two three
 

89
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,830
two three
four five

90
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
four five
 

91
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,350
four five
and possibly six and seven

92
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
and possibly six and seven
 

93
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,749
and possibly six and seven
okay sorry yeah yeah

94
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
okay sorry yeah yeah
 

95
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,869
okay sorry yeah yeah
so look everywhere listen

so look everywhere listen
 

97
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,350
so look everywhere listen
ryan listen so today you're given a list

98
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
ryan listen so today you're given a list
 

99
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,390
ryan listen so today you're given a list
of the notes

100
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
of the notes
 

101
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,229
of the notes
right you're given this one two three

102
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
right you're given this one two three
 

103
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,990
right you're given this one two three
four five six and then we

104
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
four five six and then we
 

105
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,350
four five six and then we
i want you to find out the route

106
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
i want you to find out the route
 

107
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,790
i want you to find out the route
one yeah of course this one is that

108
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
one yeah of course this one is that
 

109
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,270
one yeah of course this one is that
but how can we ask computer to find out

110
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
but how can we ask computer to find out
 

111
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,110
but how can we ask computer to find out
so you're just getting

112
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
so you're just getting
 

113
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,630
so you're just getting
you just check every night

114
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
you just check every night
 

115
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,750
you just check every night
look oh you just uh check the

116
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
look oh you just uh check the
 

117
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,309
look oh you just uh check the
very top notes but how do you know which

118
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
very top notes but how do you know which
 

119
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,030
very top notes but how do you know which
one is the

120
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
one is the
 

121
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,270
one is the
very top note that's the question so

122
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
very top note that's the question so
 

123
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,710
very top note that's the question so
each note you do

124
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
each note you do
 

125
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,509
each note you do
a breakfast set and the first one is the

126
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
a breakfast set and the first one is the
 

127
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,949
a breakfast set and the first one is the
root

128
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
root
 

129
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,790
root
the thing is we don't know the root

130
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
the thing is we don't know the root
 

131
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,710
the thing is we don't know the root
normally you're given a tree with the

132
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
normally you're given a tree with the
 

133
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,830
normally you're given a tree with the
root right

134
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
root right
 

135
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,270
root right
yeah but now the one that doesn't have a

136
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
yeah but now the one that doesn't have a
 

137
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,309
yeah but now the one that doesn't have a
parent

138
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
parent
 

139
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,830
parent
but how do you know it doesn't have a

140
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
but how do you know it doesn't have a
 

141
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,070
but how do you know it doesn't have a
pearl you can tell it has a children but

142
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
pearl you can tell it has a children but
 

143
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,869
pearl you can tell it has a children but
it doesn't have parents felon

144
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
it doesn't have parents felon
 

145
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,149
it doesn't have parents felon
so the thing is that you you for human

146
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
so the thing is that you you for human
 

147
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,070
so the thing is that you you for human
it's very easy to know okay this one is

148
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
it's very easy to know okay this one is
 

149
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,910
it's very easy to know okay this one is
the loot right but for computer it

150
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
the loot right but for computer it
 

151
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,030
the loot right but for computer it
doesn't know right because

152
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
doesn't know right because
 

153
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,430
doesn't know right because
you're given the root like you're given

154
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
you're given the root like you're given
 

155
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,550
you're given the root like you're given
a list of nouns like

156
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
a list of nouns like
 

157
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,670
a list of nouns like
2 one three four

158
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
2 one three four
 

159
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,550
2 one three four
six five seven okay so these are the

160
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
six five seven okay so these are the
 

161
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,509
six five seven okay so these are the
notes

162
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
notes
 

163
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,190
notes
and then you know for two you have

164
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
and then you know for two you have
 

165
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,270
and then you know for two you have
nothing no children but for three

166
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
nothing no children but for three
 

167
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,470
nothing no children but for three
you have you know it's what five here

168
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
you have you know it's what five here
 

169
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,550
you have you know it's what five here
and four four you know it's six and

206
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
so how in this case how we going to find
 

207
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,350
so how in this case how we going to find
out which note is the root

208
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
out which note is the root
 

209
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,390
out which note is the root
do you understand this problem

210
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
do you understand this problem
 

211
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,670
do you understand this problem
yes

212
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680

 

213
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,310

yes so which now look here you're given

yes so which now look here you're given
 

215
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,189
yes so which now look here you're given
a list of notes

216
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
a list of notes
 

217
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,270
a list of notes
look at this so how do you know which

218
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
look at this so how do you know which
 

219
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,749
look at this so how do you know which
number is the root

220
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
number is the root
 

221
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,749
number is the root
uh don't tell me it's one because i

222
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
uh don't tell me it's one because i
 

223
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,189
uh don't tell me it's one because i
i mean yeah you know

224
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199
i mean yeah you know
 

225
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,710
i mean yeah you know
you know from here you know the answer

226
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
you know from here you know the answer
 

227
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,550
you know from here you know the answer
is one but how do you know if here is

228
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
is one but how do you know if here is
 

229
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,510
is one but how do you know if here is
one

230
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
one
 

231
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,070
one
oh because like you know

232
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080

 

233
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,510

so can it yeah can you think of a way

234
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
so can it yeah can you think of a way
 

235
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,270
so can it yeah can you think of a way
any single way like two

236
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
any single way like two
 

237
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:04,550
any single way like two
so it

238
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560

 

239
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,469

and you see if that number is there

240
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
and you see if that number is there
 

241
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,270
and you see if that number is there
sorry can you repeat i guess because

242
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
sorry can you repeat i guess because
 

243

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,790
it must be the root right what's the
time complexity

504
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800

 

505
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,710

from number one

506
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720

 

507
00:11:50,720 --> 00:12:09,670

what's the space complexity

508
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680

 

509
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,670

we want to add the word to the set

510
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
we want to add the word to the set
 

511
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,509
we want to add the word to the set
chosen

512
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
chosen
 

513
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,030
chosen
which one is that something to add

514
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
which one is that something to add
 

515
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:35,430
which one is that something to add
yeah f yes what ad

516
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
