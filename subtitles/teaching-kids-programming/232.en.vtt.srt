oh hello hello hello mr mr ryan how are

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
oh hello hello hello mr mr ryan how are

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,470
oh hello hello hello mr mr ryan how are
you today good

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,510
you today good
job everyone hey just you

6
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
job everyone hey just you
 

7
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,669
job everyone hey just you
yeah uh so today we talk about the chain

8
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
yeah uh so today we talk about the chain
 

9
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,190
yeah uh so today we talk about the chain
function so what's chain

10
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
function so what's chain
 

11
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,830
function so what's chain
what does it mean chain it's like the

12
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:13,840
what does it mean chain it's like the
 

13
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,950
what does it mean chain it's like the
metal thing

14
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
metal thing
 

15
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,120
metal thing

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,790

okay i got it okay so chen so today we

20
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
okay i got it okay so chen so today we
 

21
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,549
okay i got it okay so chen so today we
are going to talk about chain function

22
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
are going to talk about chain function
 

23
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,670
are going to talk about chain function
in python okay so can you tell me okay

24
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
in python okay so can you tell me okay
 

25
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:37,990
in python okay so can you tell me okay
if

26
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
if
 

27
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,590
if
i i have a a

28
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
i i have a a
 

29
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,510
i i have a a
at least two dimensionalists all right

30
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
at least two dimensionalists all right
 

31
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,029
at least two dimensionalists all right
look at this

32
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
look at this
 

33
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,229
look at this
yeah and that one two

34
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
yeah and that one two
 

35
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,350
yeah and that one two
three another list four

36
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
three another list four
 

37
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,790
three another list four
five another next six

38
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
five another next six
 

39
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,790
five another next six
okay so this is a two dimensional list

40
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
okay so this is a two dimensional list
 

41
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,950
okay so this is a two dimensional list
yeah one two three

42
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
yeah one two three
 

43
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,310
yeah one two three
four five six so if i tell you chen

44
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
four five six so if i tell you chen
 

45
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,509
four five six so if i tell you chen
i want to keep doing a chain a

46
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
i want to keep doing a chain a
 

47
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,910
i want to keep doing a chain a
can you tell me what does it look like

48
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
can you tell me what does it look like
 

49
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,710
can you tell me what does it look like
if i have

50
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
if i have
 

51
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,710
if i have
one uh if i this is like

52
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
one uh if i this is like
 

53
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,030
one uh if i this is like
iterator and then if i put convert it to

54
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
iterator and then if i put convert it to
 

55
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,630
iterator and then if i put convert it to
the list

56
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
the list
 

57
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,310
the list
okay so can you tell me what's changed

58
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
okay so can you tell me what's changed
 

59
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,950
okay so can you tell me what's changed
what what does chain look like

60
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
what what does chain look like
 

61
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,270
what what does chain look like
come on you you're quite close right

62
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
come on you you're quite close right
 

63
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,149
come on you you're quite close right
come on

64
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
come on
 

65
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,330
come on
one two three chain

66
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:26,340
one two three chain

chair so imagine what's the chain from

70
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
chair so imagine what's the chain from
 

71
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,670
chair so imagine what's the chain from
here right you say

72
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
here right you say
 

73
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,950
here right you say
i think it's a just guess guess i think

74
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
i think it's a just guess guess i think
 

75
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,270
i think it's a just guess guess i think
it's like a chain like that

76
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
it's like a chain like that
 

77
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,030
it's like a chain like that
yeah that's a tupelo no because it looks

78
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
yeah that's a tupelo no because it looks
 

79
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,230
yeah that's a tupelo no because it looks
like a chair ah

80
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
like a chair ah
 

81
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,190
like a chair ah
no no okay yeah i i could try that's

82
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
no no okay yeah i i could try that's
 

83
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,310
no no okay yeah i i could try that's
very creative so

84
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
very creative so
 

85
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,830
very creative so
actually you would go through each

86
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
actually you would go through each
 

87
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,350
actually you would go through each
element one by one

88
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
element one by one
 

89
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,230
element one by one
and chain this like that it's never

90
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
and chain this like that it's never
 

91
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,069
and chain this like that it's never
existent at least

92
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
existent at least
 

93
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,709
existent at least
never there before so you'll be like one

94
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
never there before so you'll be like one
 

95
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,190
never there before so you'll be like one
two

96
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
two
 

97
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,109
two
three just a four five six easy yeah

98
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
three just a four five six easy yeah
 

99
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,069
three just a four five six easy yeah
yeah got it yeah so that's it yeah

100
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
yeah got it yeah so that's it yeah
 

101
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,950
yeah got it yeah so that's it yeah
that's what this

102
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
that's what this
 

103
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,510
that's what this
chain function means so you take you

104
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
chain function means so you take you
 

105
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,710
chain function means so you take you
take each this

106
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
take each this
 

107
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,830
take each this
yeah and then connect it can it and

108
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
yeah and then connect it can it and
 

109
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,990
yeah and then connect it can it and
like this look this is an iterator

110
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
like this look this is an iterator
 

111
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,030
like this look this is an iterator
what's iterator do you still remember

112
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
what's iterator do you still remember
 

113
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,949
what's iterator do you still remember
when we talk about iterator we want to

114
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
when we talk about iterator we want to
 

115
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,229
when we talk about iterator we want to
talk about keyword

116
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
talk about keyword
 

117
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,630
talk about keyword
style is why what what is it called

118
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640

it to you like yeah
 

135
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,509
it to you like yeah
yeah okay remember good memory okay so

136
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
yeah okay remember good memory okay so
 

137
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,030
yeah okay remember good memory okay so
if we want to implement this

138
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
if we want to implement this
 

139
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,670
if we want to implement this
okay given if we want to implement

140
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
okay given if we want to implement
 

141
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,750
okay given if we want to implement
actually the chain function supports the

142
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
actually the chain function supports the
 

143
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,030
actually the chain function supports the
multi-level okay not just

144
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
multi-level okay not just
 

145
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,630
multi-level okay not just
two-dimensional right

146
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
two-dimensional right
 

147
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,790
two-dimensional right
and here we are only given a

148
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
and here we are only given a
 

149
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,229
and here we are only given a
two-dimensional array

150
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
two-dimensional array
 

151
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,470
two-dimensional array
okay a two-dimensional list which is at

152
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
okay a two-dimensional list which is at
 

153
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,309
okay a two-dimensional list which is at
least containing

154
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
least containing
 

155
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,750
least containing
another list of these right so

156
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
another list of these right so
 

157
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,229
another list of these right so
it can possibly support you know a list

158
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
it can possibly support you know a list
 

159
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,750
it can possibly support you know a list
of lists of these so you can

160
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
of lists of these so you can
 

161
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,270
of lists of these so you can
support more than one you know

162
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
support more than one you know
 

163
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,589
support more than one you know
three-dimensional way maybe but let's

164
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
three-dimensional way maybe but let's
 

165
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,949
three-dimensional way maybe but let's
talk about chain function of

166
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
talk about chain function of
 

167
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,229
talk about chain function of
two-dimensional release

168
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
two-dimensional release
 

169
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,470
two-dimensional release
so if we want to implement this so it

170
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
so if we want to implement this so it
 

171
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,229
so if we want to implement this so it
should be very simple yeah

172
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
should be very simple yeah
 

173
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,229
should be very simple yeah
define chain a

174
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
define chain a
 

175
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,789
define chain a
wow

176
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799

 

177
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,589

okay so now do we intervention remember

178
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
okay so now do we intervention remember
 

179
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,470
okay so now do we intervention remember
already

180
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
already
 

181
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,869
already
a is at least okay one two

182
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
a is at least okay one two
 

183
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,630
a is at least okay one two
three four so how can we iterate

184
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
three four so how can we iterate
 

185
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,390
three four so how can we iterate
over this list all right so what how can

186
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
over this list all right so what how can
 

187
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:56,580
over this list all right so what how can
we iterate

188
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:56,590
