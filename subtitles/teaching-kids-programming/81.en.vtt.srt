um i'm your teacher
 

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,070
um i'm your teacher
talk about this coming distance you know

12
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
talk about this coming distance you know
 

13
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,450

so actually it's quite intense so

18
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
so actually it's quite intense so
 

19
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,750
so actually it's quite intense so
look what's coming distance um it's a

20
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
look what's coming distance um it's a

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,750
look what's coming distance um it's a
hermit distance is applied for two

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,549

no a and b okay so for example if

26
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
no a and b okay so for example if
 

27
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,229
no a and b okay so for example if
15 and finally is what

28
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:40,239
15 and finally is what
 

29
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,430
15 and finally is what
one one one okay and then let's say

30
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
one one one okay and then let's say
 

31
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,110
one one one okay and then let's say
a in binary one is

32
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
a in binary one is
 

33
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,709
a in binary one is
one

34
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719

 

35
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,389

why what one it's if it's a power of two

36
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
why what one it's if it's a power of two
 

37
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,150
why what one it's if it's a power of two
it's one followed by zero yeah

38
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
it's one followed by zero yeah
 

39
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,710
it's one followed by zero yeah
so it's one

40
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:58,720
so it's one

how many beats
 

51
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,510
how many beats
three three yeah look three so this

52
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
three three yeah look three so this
 

53
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,429
three three yeah look three so this
these three the timing distance is three

54
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
these three the timing distance is three
 

55
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,070
these three the timing distance is three
okay

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
okay
 

57
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,469
okay
yeah yeah so basically humming distance

58
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
yeah yeah so basically humming distance
 

59
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,070
yeah yeah so basically humming distance
is that the number of

60
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
is that the number of
 

61
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,190
is that the number of
bits different different bits in two

62
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
bits different different bits in two
 

63
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,670
bits different different bits in two
different integers so let's say another

64
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
different integers so let's say another
 

65
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,429
different integers so let's say another
example like this one

66
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439

 

67
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,830

so look this is the what this is

68
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
so look this is the what this is
 

69
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,109
so look this is the what this is
two two plus one uh this is one one

70
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
two two plus one uh this is one one
 

71
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,710
two two plus one uh this is one one
uh four five yeah five yes one plus four

72
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
uh four five yeah five yes one plus four
 

73
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,749
uh four five yeah five yes one plus four
and then this is one plus two three

74
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
and then this is one plus two three
 

75
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,550
and then this is one plus two three
three plus eight eleven right yeah is it

76
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
three plus eight eleven right yeah is it
 

77
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,830
three plus eight eleven right yeah is it
eleven

78
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
eleven
 

79
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,230
eleven
is eleven so having distance between

80
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
is eleven so having distance between
 

81
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,190
is eleven so having distance between
five and eleven

82
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
five and eleven
 

83
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,860
five and eleven
is

how can we do this do you still one
 

89
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,510
how can we do this do you still one
thing do you still remember this x or

90
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
thing do you still remember this x or
 

91
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,350
thing do you still remember this x or
exclusive or one exclusive

92
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
exclusive or one exclusive
 

93
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,389
exclusive or one exclusive
or zero is one one exclusive

94
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
or zero is one one exclusive
 

95
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,510
or zero is one one exclusive
zero exclusive one is one zero and zero

96
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
zero exclusive one is one zero and zero
 

97
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,309
zero exclusive one is one zero and zero
is zero

98
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
is zero
 

99
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,990
is zero
one and one is zero when they are

100
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
one and one is zero when they are
 

101
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,990
one and one is zero when they are
different one are different

102
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
different one are different
 

103
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,030
different one are different
like exclusive o is one when they are

104
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
like exclusive o is one when they are
 

105
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,670
like exclusive o is one when they are
same is zero so look if we do this

106
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
same is zero so look if we do this
 

107
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,510
same is zero so look if we do this
exclusive or it will be

108
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
exclusive or it will be
 

109
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,110
exclusive or it will be
zero one one one right look at this

110
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
zero one one one right look at this
 

111
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,190
zero one one one right look at this
if we do the exclusive or you'll be one

112
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
if we do the exclusive or you'll be one
 

113
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,229
if we do the exclusive or you'll be one
what will be that

114
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
what will be that
 

115
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,430
what will be that
zero one one one do you get it

116
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
zero one one one do you get it
 

117
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,830
zero one one one do you get it
so if we apply the exclusive or and

118
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
so if we apply the exclusive or and
 

119
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,270
so if we apply the exclusive or and
then we call how many ones

120
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
then we call how many ones
 

121
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,229
then we call how many ones
all right do you still remember that we

122
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
all right do you still remember that we
 

123
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:48,869
all right do you still remember that we
we know

124
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
we know
 

125
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,270
we know
how to count how many ones in the binary

126
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
how to count how many ones in the binary
 

127
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,030
how to count how many ones in the binary
yeah we talked about this the day before

128
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
yeah we talked about this the day before
 

129
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,790
yeah we talked about this the day before
yesterday remember

130
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
yesterday remember
 

131
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,910
yesterday remember
yeah so can you tell me how to do it

132
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
yeah so can you tell me how to do it
 

133
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,509
yeah so can you tell me how to do it
we need to do define i mean distance

134
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
we need to do define i mean distance
 

135
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,630
we need to do define i mean distance
yeah summing distance

136
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
yeah summing distance
 

137
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,910
yeah summing distance
a and b corner right okay

138
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
a and b corner right okay
 

139
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,110
a and b corner right okay
look look so first of all

140
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
look look so first of all
 

141
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,390
look look so first of all
a n equals a exclusive b

142
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
a n equals a exclusive b
 

143
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,670
a n equals a exclusive b
right exclusive this look let's

144
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
right exclusive this look let's
 

145
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,869
right exclusive this look let's
use this b

146
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
use this b
 

147
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,910
use this b
this means exclusive oh yeah this

148
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
this means exclusive oh yeah this
 

149
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,350
this means exclusive oh yeah this
is in let's look in the sixth

150
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
is in let's look in the sixth
 

151
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,070
is in let's look in the sixth
number six this six yeah this is

152
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
number six this six yeah this is
 

153
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,070
number six this six yeah this is
exclusive oh so look

154
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
exclusive oh so look
 

155
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,789
exclusive oh so look
yeah so when you done this right when

156
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
yeah so when you done this right when
 

157
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,750
yeah so when you done this right when
you done this

158
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
you done this
 

159
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,509
you done this
and will be the lamp we're contents

160
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
and will be the lamp we're contents
 

161
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,070
and will be the lamp we're contents
uh we contains the exclusive of both

162
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
uh we contains the exclusive of both
 

163
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,789
uh we contains the exclusive of both
integers

164
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
integers
 

165
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,030
integers
and then if we just count how many ones

166
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
and then if we just count how many ones
 

167
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,070
and then if we just count how many ones
in that that will be the humming

168
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
in that that will be the humming
 

169
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,910
in that that will be the humming
distance i'm right

and do you still remember how we compute
 

173
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,869

so if if a number is three exclusive or

256
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
so if if a number is three exclusive or
 

257
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,749
so if if a number is three exclusive or
three equals one

259
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,309

think about it if the two same number

think about it if the two same number
 

261
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,990

exclusive together will be

think about it three if the same number
 

267
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,230
think about it three if the same number
see

268
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
see
 

269
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,590
see
three is one one one and then three is

270
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
three is one one one and then three is
 

271
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,230
three is one one one and then three is
one one so exclusive row would be one

272
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240

 

273
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,590

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,189
then each spin will be zero right you
get it

so look if z one exclusive zero if you

306
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
so look if z one exclusive zero if you
 

307
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,510

want
 

309
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,990
want
right yeah and then if we exclusive zero

310
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
right yeah and then if we exclusive zero
 

311
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,430
right yeah and then if we exclusive zero
you'll be one again right

zero one yeah
exclusive that would be zero one one yes

342
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
exclusive that would be zero one one yes
 

343
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,189
exclusive that would be zero one one yes
yeah and then again one one zero one

344
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
yeah and then again one one zero one
 

345
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,629
yeah and then again one one zero one
will be

346
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
will be
 

347
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,589
will be
zero one one look this is the same as

348
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
zero one one look this is the same as
 

349
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,510
zero one one look this is the same as
the beginning

350
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
the beginning
 

351
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,630
the beginning
yes okay now what's the time complexity

352
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
yes okay now what's the time complexity
 

353
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,589
yes okay now what's the time complexity
of this one

354
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:38,599

what is it look if it's binary because
it represents

00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
entirely do you remember we talked about
 

369
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,269
entirely do you remember we talked about
this in let us say

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,389
this in let us say
o one o what a

o one o what a
 

373
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,630

375
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,750

remember if a is one

376
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
remember if a is one
 

377
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,030
remember if a is one
how many bits of the how many bits of

378
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
how many bits of the how many bits of
 

379
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,310
how many bits of the how many bits of
a in binary a one three

380
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
a in binary a one three
 

381
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,110
a in binary a one three
three so that's locked to eight how many

382
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
three so that's locked to eight how many
 

383
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,070

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
bits in
 

385
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,750
bits in
sixteen there are

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
sixteen there are
 

387
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,350
sixteen there are
four four so lock lock sixteen so how

388
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
four four so lock lock sixteen so how
 

389
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,829
four four so lock lock sixteen so how
many

390
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839

okay so one more question what's this

426
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
okay so one more question what's this
 

427
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,750
okay so one more question what's this
what does this mean what does this mean

428
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
what does this mean what does this mean
 

429
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,630
what does this mean what does this mean
n and

430
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
n and
 

431
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,550
n and
equals n minus one what does this mean

432
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
equals n minus one what does this mean
 

433
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:57,590
equals n minus one what does this mean
can you explain

434
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600

 

435
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,870

n minus one is zero 1 1 1 and your n

436
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
n minus one is zero 1 1 1 and your n
 

437
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,990
n minus one is zero 1 1 1 and your n
will be 0. so what does it mean

438
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
will be 0. so what does it mean
 

439
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,430
will be 0. so what does it mean
it means that what does it mean

440
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
it means that what does it mean
 

441
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,269
it means that what does it mean
it doesn't matter i need any numbers

442
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
it doesn't matter i need any numbers
 

443
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,829
it doesn't matter i need any numbers
here okay it doesn't matter

444
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839

 

445
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,030

um does it mean

446
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
um does it mean
