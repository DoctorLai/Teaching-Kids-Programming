1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
go hello mri all right

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,520
okay so today we're going to talk about

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,960
how to rotate this uh array okay away

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,040
like one

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,040
two three four five six seven that's an

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,040
array

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,920
yeah we don't if we want to rotate it

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,640
once then

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,480
what we do is we take this element from

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,599
the end seven and we'll put it in the

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,680
front

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:32,160
so that will become

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,280
seven one two three four five six

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,920
yeah and then if we rotate again

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,840
well we become you become six seven yeah

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,840
we remove the one element from the end

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,600
and put it in front

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,239
one two three four five okay

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,800
so that's k equals one and then k equals

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,800
two equals that and k equals three will

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,199
become what

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,640
one more rotate well what we this

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,120
already come

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,800
i put take the take one from the end and

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
put it in

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,199
one two three four

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,880
yeah exactly okay

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,799
yeah that's the

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,560
today we're going to talk about rotation

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,880
we want to rotate an array with the nums

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,159
yeah and then we'll use k k is a

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,759
positive number

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,200
okay so let's say if there are n

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,560
elements

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,920
and equals the length of the dams

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,600
so is

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,400
for example in this case there are seven

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,520
elements right so

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:36,159
so if k equals n k equals seven as well

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,640
so do i need to rotate it seven times

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,600
how about fourteen times

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,880
um

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,200
yeah why is that can you tell me why why

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,399
if n equals seven and we want to rotate

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,280
the seven times

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,759
why we don't need to do anything

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,759
because

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,719
n equals k yeah because what if we

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,600
rotate the k times what happened

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,600
oh my god

51
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,320
k because k is

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,119
n yeah

53
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,800
k is the same thing and then yeah i know

54
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,120
what happened i mean

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,360
and then

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,160
we're done that's excellent very well

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,120
done yes that's excellent so base for

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,120
example like if n equals k then

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,040
we rotate that seven times we'll be

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,400
pivoting seven times then you will come

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,599
back to one two three four five six

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,920
seven right so if we do say eight times

63
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,720
that's that's the same as rotate as one

64
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,560
time if there we we we

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,840
rotate the nine times is the same as

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,560
we'll say two times so basically k

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,680
rotate k times is actually k

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,640
rotate the same as k rotate as

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,640
percentage n what's percentage

70
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,160
yeah what's percentage do you still

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,720
remember the symbol

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,720
percentage

73
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,280
modulus yeah

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,200
modulus okay so this is k like the

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,680
modulus yeah because look

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,000
n modulus n is zero okay okay

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,680
okay so then we can do this uh

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,599
we first of all we

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,879
we make sure this k

80
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,040
is between zero and k

81
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,720
k minus one right because

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,080
when you put a k modulus n the result

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,319
can only be

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,480
and different

85
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,560
different cases you'll be the result

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,200
will be between 0 2

87
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,360
and minus 1 inclusive

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,799
okay that's the

89
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,920
modulus

90
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,560
so we can do this we can do this uh by

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,280
rotating it so we can do this just

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,440
simulation simulation so

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,360
rotate one time we take the element from

94
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,400
the end and put it in the front

95
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,760
okay so let's say first of all k modulus

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,200
equals n so k modulus equal n is the

97
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,879
same as

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,360
k equal k minus n okay it's like it's

99
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,280
like k plus equal 1 what's what does

100
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,720
this mean

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,519
k

102
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,519
equals k plus 1 right yeah

103
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,519
yeah so look this is the same thing

104
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,920
another one k

105
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,040
multiplies equals 2

106
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,560
that's the same as k equals k times 2

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,000
right

108
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,440
yeah

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,840
okay so now we just have to

110
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,000
we just have to do this k times 4

111
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,240
underscore in range k

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,280
this is a numbers yeah numbers so we

113
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,800
take it from the end which is nouns dot

114
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,479
pod

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,040
that's the part so one two three we

116
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,360
we do this num stop top

117
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,759
so basically we don't support you will

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,800
take these three out of the numbers and

119
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,240
put it in the x right so now what's next

120
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,320
next is to put this x in the front in

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,440
the front so we do this

122
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,759
nums

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,880
dot insert

124
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,960
insert x right you see so first of all

125
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,520
we take it from the end and we put it in

126
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,960
the front but insert insert the first

127
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,800
parameter is the

128
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,199
place so we want to insert at the

129
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,400
beginning so which is the index field of

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,120
x okay

131
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,120
so

132
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,039
that will be i know we return numbers

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,440
yeah

134
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,919
original numbers but but here we are we

135
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,720
are operating on the numbers directory

136
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,520
directly so we're doing modifying the

137
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,039
array in in place so the problem of

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,039
these is that

139
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,479
what's the problem with this is because

140
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:40,240
these num insert takes o and time

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:43,039
this is uh and lam this is the array at

142
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,800
least so any operation on the right hand

143
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,759
side is constant for example like you

144
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,880
append

145
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,440
or pop this is constant but

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,919
as long as you want to insert on at the

147
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,800
beginning right insert at the beginning

148
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,360
that takes on time insert a pen let a

149
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,600
pen on on the left or you remove an

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,400
element in the middle that's o in time

151
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,440
so the time conductor is okay times n is

152
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,680
okay n right let's know

153
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,400
one way to apply uh

154
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,800
to improve this is using a double ndq

155
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,400
right so for example ndq

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,880
what we get for free is the o1 constant

157
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,080
term in both direction yeah you can you

158
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,759
can append

159
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,120
you can append

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,800
pop

161
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,039
open left top left let's both of one

162
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,639
constant time right so we can change

163
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,280
this by uh so if if this is the

164
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
this is the

165
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,800
uh dq so we we can do this num

166
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:49,120
so equals dq

167
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,520
num right so we make it a we make it um

168
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,520
so first of all we make it uh

169
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,759
actually that's that's not

170
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,759
directly modified here let's make it an

171
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,639
another another a equals dq numbers now

172
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,160
we can do this x equals

173
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,560
a dot pop

174
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,759
and then nums the insert to the left

175
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,280
then we can say a dot append left

176
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,000
append left this is one constant time x

177
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,800
right now the time connection is okay

178
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,960
but

179
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,039
we have to change this

180
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,840
now we want to assign it back to nums

181
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,960
right

182
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,479
so we can do this nums

183
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,599
nums

184
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,599
equals this we change the dq into the

185
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,440
array this egg

186
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,080
okay and then we can present

187
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,280
within arms yeah

188
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,520
okay

189
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,840
this is uh using the double ended cube

190
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,520
yeah we're using the double angle to do

191
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,720
it

192
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,039
okay so

193
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,400
another way of doing this is look one

194
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,800
two three four five okay let's see

195
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,080
then if we rotate two times that's going

196
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,520
to become

197
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,960
four five one two three right so if you

198
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,199
look at this

199
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,960
look if you look at this

200
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,520
yeah one two three four five two four

201
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,080
four five one two three so this is the k

202
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
we want to put the last k element

203
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,240
in the front

204
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,560
all right

205
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,120
yeah we want to put basically we want to

206
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,199
we want to take the last k element and

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,479
put it in the front so what we can do is

208
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,960
what one two three four five then if we

209
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,919
reverse this bit that'll become five

210
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,879
four

211
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,639
three two one right so five four six two

212
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,240
one so now the first k numbers are

213
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,039
reverse

214
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,320
right

215
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,360
and

216
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,039
the next n minus k numbers are also

217
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,719
reversed so we just have to reverse

218
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,560
stupid uh the first of all is to reverse

219
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,040
the first k numbers and then we reverse

220
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,279
the n minus k numbers yeah that's one

221
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,920
way of doing this

222
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,800
how do we reverse a list or such string

223
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,519
we can use these what kind of syntax do

224
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,519
you still remember

225
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,560
what

226
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,720
[Music]

227
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,440
yeah how do we reverse this how do we if

228
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,200
chronologically

229
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,839
but now look

230
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,760
we we want to re this this gives a new

231
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
copy so we don't want to do that we want

232
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,600
to directly reverse

233
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,440
reverse on the list so first of all we

234
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,920
reverse this array and then we reverse

235
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,680
the first k numbers and we deliver the n

236
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,000
minus k numbers so

237
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,320
we in order to reverse this we can use

238
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,120
these two pointer yeah so look

239
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,920
two

240
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,160
two pointers we swap yeah and then we

241
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,600
move them towards each other until they

242
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,480
meet in the middle yeah that's the

243
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,720
classic uh uh reversed uh

244
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,440
accurate for for a list or a string

245
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,560
right so let's quickly rewrite that

246
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,560
let's quickly write that

247
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,360
so first of all we can say divide define

248
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,560
reverse the left and right okay

249
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,720
so wire this is you know this for a long

250
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,920
time we talked about this for a very

251
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,720
very long time why the left smaller than

252
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,399
right

253
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,519
why the left and right

254
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,680
no meet

255
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,800
then we have to

256
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,200
swap nums air

257
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,399
nouns are

258
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,399
equals nums

259
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,200
we want to swap two things

260
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,200
all right do you still remember

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,120
we're done that's very excellent yeah

262
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,360
yeah and then

263
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
when we swap it then what's the next

264
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,399
thing

265
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,440
what's the next thing so look at what

266
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,279
that is

267
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,640
and

268
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,600
what's that

269
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,120
um

270
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,160
join

271
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,519
the look l r here so i swap these two

272
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,040
and then what's that what's happening

273
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,040
why the air is not r

274
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:56,570
[Music]

275
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,240
yeah so this is the classic uh reverse

276
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,160
function so the time connection is our n

277
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,959
if there are n elements here obviously

278
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,720
they're both both until both the pointer

279
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,800
meet in the middle that's going to take

280
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,560
most end operations

281
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,040
actually and operation

282
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,240
so now we just have to do this with this

283
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,800
reverse

284
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,839
we just need to do what

285
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,440
first of all we must

286
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,320
reverse the numbers from 0 to n minus 1

287
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,519
then

288
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,720
again reverse the first k numbers here

289
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
okay numbers

290
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,160
zero k minus one

291
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,160
and then reverse the

292
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,560
n minus k numbers so if it starts from n

293
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:46,000
to k to n minus one right so three

294
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,120
operations first of all is to reverse um

295
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,600
uh

296
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,320
first reverse the entire thing

297
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,200
because the first k numbers reverse the

298
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,040
uh minus k numbers right and minus k

299
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,160
numbers

300
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,600
okay so

301
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,800
so one two three four five

302
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,320
as we said

303
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,040
we want to take at least

304
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,079
four five put it in the front so four

305
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,560
five one two three so we can actually do

306
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,560
this very easily without the reversing

307
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,160
but it's a trick for the person yeah so

308
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,160
we can just say

309
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,200
nums

310
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,360
eric what's the noise the k

311
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,480
up to k up to k

312
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
and then nums

313
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,120
k to the n yeah so basically this

314
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,440
this is this part

315
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,800
this is this part

316
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,440
yeah equals what these these will be

317
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,880
equals to

318
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,760
uh

319
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,920
to to this bit yeah to this bit so it

320
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,320
will be equal to

321
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,320
nums

322
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,560
uh minus k to the n right and then this

323
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,720
bit

324
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,200
will be

325
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,200
nums

326
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,600
uh

327
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,600
how do we like this

328
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,600
um

329
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,680
this one we want to say the first k

330
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,399
numbers is actually

331
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,320
to

332
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,279
uh

333
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,760
2

334
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,920
to minus k right so counting backwards

335
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,399
right and then now now that will be

336
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,560
minus k to the n

337
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,560
yeah

338
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,680
so it's minus 2k to the n

339
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,720
so what how do we interpret this minus k

340
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,360
minus k to the end will be set to the k

341
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,199
power so here will be to lead speed

342
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,959
yeah to this bit

343
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,639
so y is minus k

344
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,160
minus k

345
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,160
minus k to the end

346
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,920
uh minus k so my this is k minus k is

347
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,120
this bit

348
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,240
minus take to to the bit to the end

349
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,240
right hmm

350
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,160
uh

351
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,800
okay so so

352
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,680
minus k so so let's interpret this

353
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,760
numbers k to the end nums k

354
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,760
this is the original ray okay k to the n

355
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,680
k to the n so

356
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,279
k to the n is least bit

357
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,920
yeah this bit

358
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,480
equals num to decay

359
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,160
to to up to k so you'll be up to this

360
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,600
point yes and then numbs up to k up to

361
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,959
case this bit

362
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,480
equals nums up to k so it's this way

363
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,360
okay

364
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,000
yeah so this is basically the same as as

365
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,120
these but we write it in python which is

366
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
um

367
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,199
you know you know more elegant it's use

368
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,519
the least comprehension yeah

369
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,040
comprehension okay so let's see three

370
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,600
ways of doing this

371
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,279
so which way do you think it's

372
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,480
you can do it i mean you like it the

373
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,639
most which way

374
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,399
which way you like

375
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,000
there are three methods the first one

376
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,639
using the

377
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,839
list right the pop and insert that's

378
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,639
going to take

379
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,360
okay end time right okay and time

380
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,079
the second one using the double ndq

381
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,040
which is we because we we have improved

382
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,480
uh

383
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,519
uh

384
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,600
we want to get this one constant term by

385
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,639
inserting the element in the beginning

386
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,160
so that's

387
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:31,279
one okay right the third one

388
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,759
the third one is reversing

389
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,000
reversing this is o and time right why

390
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,279
is that look yeah we're downloading

391
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,360
so

392
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:43,440
i mean okay and on um but look k is

393
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,279
smaller than n right because we we do

394
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,279
this operation right so

395
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,279
k modulus equals x

396
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,320
oh okay

397
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,440
yeah since it's shorter and faster

398
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,160
whether k k is smaller than n yeah but

399
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,440
remember we use this if if we don't do

400
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,920
this the k might be a minion right okay

401
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,000
so i have one two three four five seven

402
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,759
so let's rotate it a million times do

403
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,519
you actually want to rotate it a million

404
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,279
times

405
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,240
no because there's no point if you

406
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,680
rotate after seven times you'll be

407
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,279
you'll be coming back to the origin

408
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,079
right you just have to we just have to

409
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,279
find out which right k modulus input

410
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,680
right so after this k is smaller than or

411
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,800
equal smaller than n like smaller than

412
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,320
and

413
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,240
n times

414
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,720
so k is smaller than n so the second

415
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,160
operation is okay the third operation is

416
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,480
oh and why is that because we are

417
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,240
reversing the whole string

418
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,600
and then we're reversing the first thing

419
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,079
it's actually

420
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,240
it's actually largely o

421
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,279
n times two but we drop the constant

422
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,440
okay

423
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,759
and this one as well this one is the

424
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,680
nicer way of the third operation okay

425
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,759
it's not easy to

426
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,160
to find out which corresponds to which

427
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,880
so num look for example numbers k to the

428
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,000
n

429
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,440
is this big i want to divide this speed

430
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,520
so let

431
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,559
that comes to

432
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,400
that that would be overwriting by numbs

433
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,199
up to minus k

434
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,880
uh

435
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,799
not up to minus k so is up to minus k

436
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,000
this is minus k here

437
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,160
so actually it will be this big okay so

438
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
basically that's why it's saying okay i

439
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,559
want to rewrite this bit

440
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,240
using this bit and i want to write this

441
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,720
bit in this bit

442
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,679
yeah so it's the same thing here

443
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,919
okay no videos for today bye bye

444
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,919
bye bye
