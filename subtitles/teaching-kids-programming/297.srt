1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,800
okay so today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,120
a simple problem which is called reshape

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,880
the metric okay so what's magic what

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,759
metric

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,440
uh let's say we're given a list of a way

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,840
okay one dimensional array right and

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,920
right dimension all right so it's a list

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,800
so let's say array equals

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,480
one two three four alright listen to me

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,640
write this to me look

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,119
at this four elements yeah and if you

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,399
want to if i tell you that i want to

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,120
reshape it

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,000
reshape it to two times two two rows two

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,239
columns so what does it become so

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,960
well what if it you want to shape it

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,120
like four times one

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,360
good job look two times two is like that

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,920
one two you always start feeling the

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,120
rose there one two

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,039
three four yeah okay so this is yeah so

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
yeah i know you mean four times one what

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039
do you say four times one so what does

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,320
it come to come

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,559
ah one two three four easy

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,560
yeah so each one is a

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,240
it's a two dimensional array how about

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
one times four

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,439
nine it will be the same it'll be the

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
same

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,280
yeah yeah yeah

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
actually it will be different because

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,479
this is one dimension

34
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,600
if we convert it to one time slot you'll

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,159
be like that

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,680
another list yeah

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,560
okay let's just start to be different

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,920
okay

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,280
so however if i tell you i want to

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,240
convert this to

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,439
two times the three is it possible

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,280
two times no why is that because it

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,000
means four

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,920
yeah because look we only have five

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,240
six we're done whether we have four

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,399
elements but now the top is six evidence

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,880
so that's not possible so we do ten

48
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,560
scratch empty list

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,840
that's it yeah

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,600
so

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,119
first of all first question is how do we

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,960
allocate a

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,719
scratch

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,200
how do we allocate a three times two

55
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,040
metric with zero with zero

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,119
how do we how to allocate look three

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
times two three rows two columns yeah

58
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,520
three rows two columns so it will be

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,080
zero zero

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,520
zero zero how do we allocate these they

61
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
look like eyes

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,440
how do we look accurately a list of

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,680
lists yeah a list of these which has a

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
list which has three read these sublets

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,599
and each of these has

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,400
two elements there's three rows two

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,560
columns

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,599
so look if the target then let's say the

69
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,440
target equals one

70
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,080
zero right

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,560
for underscore means that we don't

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,080
we don't need to use this variable in

73
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,000
range

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,680
inventory how many how many elements are

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,640
these

76
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,879
three how many elements of each service

77
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,200
two two yeah so this is the columns

78
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,599
first anime you need to put in columns

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,120
and then this is a service yeah and then

80
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,480
four

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,080
in range invented how many laws

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,120
how many rows

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
uh

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,840
three zeros yeah that's the way we

85
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,680
allocate a two dimensional

86
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
uh two dimensional

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,640
in python okay which is this if we

88
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
replace this with the r and with the c

89
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
and this is r this is the way to

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,080
allocate a

91
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,400
two dimensional which is r times c

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,360
metric in person okay and then we can

93
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,760
start following the list one by one and

94
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,159
start feeling it in in you know one by

95
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,480
one in the world yeah look look

96
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,760
one two three four how how do we how do

97
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,680
we

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,560
allocate how do we feel it in here

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
yeah

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,840
uh yeah like look at it

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,560
so this is the animal in the face so

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
look one we put it here

103
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
two

104
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,599
two

105
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,400
three

106
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,080
four that's it that's the angle okay all

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,319
right so we write it and you'll be easy

108
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,319
quick

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,080
define

110
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,080
the keyword we shade

111
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,959
we want to reshape the first dimensional

112
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,480
metric

113
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,480
array to the

114
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,760
metric right we turn that let's say the

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,159
array a

116
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,120
we want to reshape it into our

117
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,000
arrow c columns

118
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
okay

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,080
so first single

120
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,040
first thing we need to check is

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,000
can we do this so right so let's

122
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,759
if

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,560
length a

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,400
not equal not equal one

125
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,720
let's say no equal one

126
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
length

127
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,360
this is

128
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,360
length three it's four do that times

129
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,080
tables

130
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,720
i is two c is two so how can we check if

131
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,440
it's equal if it's uh possible to do it

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
or not to check for times tables so r

133
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,639
times what

134
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,400
c right if it's not equal then return

135
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,320
empty right

136
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,320
okay and then next next we what should

137
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,600
we do we should create an answer

138
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,000
all right right

139
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,400
answer equals

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,080
zero for underscore in range one c or r

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,840
come on tell me

142
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,120
when you ask

143
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,360
for

144
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
underscore in range can you tell me what

145
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,960
should i put here

146
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,880
exactly here c c or r or c r or rc come

147
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,520
on

148
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,880
cr yes yeah first of all you see and

149
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,440
then r i found your nails yeah

150
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,840
okay and then we start from we started

151
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,160
feeling that right let's say the index i

152
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,039
equals yellow right and then we start to

153
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,880
loop into the start to iterate over this

154
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,639
answer

155
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,639
we start to iterate over this answer

156
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,479
metric right and then to fill in the

157
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,560
values so for r uh let's say for

158
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,639
we have used r okay let's let's do it

159
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,160
for

160
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,600
r okay

161
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,520
in range

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,039
ah

163
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,919
and then

164
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,960
for

165
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,039
cc

166
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,759
in range c i will go through each

167
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,680
element in the new

168
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,280
metric right

169
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,479
and then

170
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,800
answer we start to fill in the number r

171
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,960
c c equals what

172
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,240
equals one now this index is i so

173
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,720
