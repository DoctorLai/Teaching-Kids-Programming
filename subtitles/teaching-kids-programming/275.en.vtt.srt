yeah
we talk about island thingy november

8
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,120
we talk about island thingy november
 

9
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,470
we talk about island thingy november
island

10
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480
island
 

11
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,549
island
we use the deficits to cloud the number

12
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
we use the deficits to cloud the number
 

13
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,310
we use the deficits to cloud the number
of islands right and we use the

14
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
of islands right and we use the
 

15
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,109
of islands right and we use the
definition to count to return the

16
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,119
definition to count to return the
 

17
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,269
definition to count to return the
maximum size of the island right these

18
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
maximum size of the island right these
 

19
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,910
maximum size of the island right these
two are similar we use this devil search

20
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
two are similar we use this devil search
 

21
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,070
two are similar we use this devil search
today we're going to solve another

22
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080
today we're going to solve another
 

23
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,509
today we're going to solve another
island problem

24
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
island problem
 

25
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,790
island problem
is

26
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
is
 

27
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,790
is
given a two dimensional yeah two

28
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
given a two dimensional yeah two
 

29
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,549
given a two dimensional yeah two
dimensional two-dimensional metric one

30
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
dimensional two-dimensional metric one
 

31
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,590
dimensional two-dimensional metric one
is island a lamp

32
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
is island a lamp
 

33
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,430
is island a lamp
zero is what

34
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440

 

35
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,150

water yeah you see okay so if i do this

36
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
water yeah you see okay so if i do this
 

37
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,510
water yeah you see okay so if i do this
one one

38
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
one one
 

39
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,190
one one
zero zero okay then one one one one one

40
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
zero zero okay then one one one one one
 

41
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,229
zero zero okay then one one one one one
one

42

one
 

43
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,750
one
and then one zero that's such a big

44
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
and then one zero that's such a big
 

45
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,229
and then one zero that's such a big
matter okay i'm just going to do

46
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
matter okay i'm just going to do
 

47
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,750
matter okay i'm just going to do
something okay

48
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
something okay
 

49
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,709
something okay
i think

five six six okay so we we we want to
 

95
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,830
five six six okay so we we we want to
know the surrounding island okay what's

96
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
know the surrounding island okay what's
 

97
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,630
know the surrounding island okay what's
the surrounding surrounding

98
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
the surrounding surrounding
 

99
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,790
the surrounding surrounding
surrounding island means that the island

100
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
surrounding island means that the island
 

101
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,710
surrounding island means that the island
needs to completely be surrounded by

102
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
needs to completely be surrounded by
 

103
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,910
needs to completely be surrounded by
zeros

104
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
zeros
 

105
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,070
zeros
all right it needs to be in

106
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
all right it needs to be in
 

107
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,630
all right it needs to be in
surrounded by zero so which ones are

108
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
surrounded by zero so which ones are
 

109
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,470
surrounded by zero so which ones are
completely surrounded by zero and the

110
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
completely surrounded by zero and the
 

111
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,630
completely surrounded by zero and the
first one the two one

112
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
first one the two one
 

113
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,470
first one the two one
why is this one no no no

completely
 

121
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,270
completely
zero right not why is that

122
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
zero right not why is that
 

123
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,070
zero right not why is that
there isn't one here

124
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
there isn't one here
 

125
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,309
there isn't one here
that's fine it's not horizontal but look

126
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
that's fine it's not horizontal but look
 

127
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,229
that's fine it's not horizontal but look
it cannot completely we only consider

128
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
it cannot completely we only consider
 

129
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,990
it cannot completely we only consider
the horizontal like that yeah

130
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000

 

131
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,309

that's fine and even here

132
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
that's fine and even here
 

133
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,589
that's fine and even here
look at this one

134
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
look at this one
 

135
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,990
look at this one
it is completely surrounded okay we only

136
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
it is completely surrounded okay we only
 

137
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,390
it is completely surrounded okay we only
considering the horizontal and vertical

138
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
considering the horizontal and vertical
 

139
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,190
considering the horizontal and vertical
we don't consider this thing no okay so

140
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
we don't consider this thing no okay so
 

141
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,229
we don't consider this thing no okay so
only this one i'll do the round okay

142
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
only this one i'll do the round okay
 

143
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,309
only this one i'll do the round okay
just listen to me

144
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
just listen to me
 

145
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,030
just listen to me
yeah i'm talking about this this one and

146
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
yeah i'm talking about this this one and
 

147
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,949
yeah i'm talking about this this one and
this one and but not this one yeah

148
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
this one and but not this one yeah
 

149
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,869
this one and but not this one yeah
because there's no water here and

150
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
because there's no water here and
 

151
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,350
because there's no water here and
there's no water here okay so in this

152
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
there's no water here okay so in this
 

153
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,390
there's no water here okay so in this
case return to

154
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
case return to
 

155
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,509
case return to
yeah make sense

156
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
yeah make sense
 

157
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,350
yeah make sense
if it's on the border

158
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
if it's on the border
 

159
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,030
if it's on the border
if it's on the border

160
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
if it's on the border
 

161
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,869
if it's on the border
it's not the island we're looking for

162
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
it's not the island we're looking for
 

163
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,390
it's not the island we're looking for
because if it's on the border there's

164
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
because if it's on the border there's
 

165
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,790
because if it's on the border there's
something here that you can imagine this

166
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
something here that you can imagine this
 

167
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,869
something here that you can imagine this
this is not wrong houses

168
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
this is not wrong houses
 

169
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,910

any idea how is hormones well

202
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
any idea how is hormones well
 

203
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,949
any idea how is hormones well
we don't do we don't look at the islands

204
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
we don't do we don't look at the islands
 

205
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,229
we don't do we don't look at the islands
on people

206
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
on people
 

207
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,990
on people
yeah that's good good we don't look at

208
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
yeah that's good good we don't look at
 

209
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,990
yeah that's good good we don't look at
the islands on the border yeah so how do

210
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
the islands on the border yeah so how do
 

211
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,309
the islands on the border yeah so how do
we do this remember before we want to

212
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
we do this remember before we want to
 

213
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,910
we do this remember before we want to
count the differences right we only

214
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
count the differences right we only
 

215
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,509
count the differences right we only
count the number of islands including a

216
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
count the number of islands including a
 

217
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,189
count the number of islands including a
border right

218
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
border right
 

219
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:17,990
border right
so

220
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
so
 

221
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,229
so
how do we do it we just

222
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
how do we do it we just
 

223
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,150
how do we do it we just
we just go through each one if it's one

224
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
we just go through each one if it's one
 

225
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,909
we just go through each one if it's one
we do the definition and we plus one

226
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
we do the definition and we plus one
 

227
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,510
we do the definition and we plus one
right okay

228
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
right okay
 

229
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:37,909
right okay
so you delete all

230
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919

 

231
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,390

how about how about if i do the

232
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
how about how about if i do the
 

233
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,510
how about how about if i do the
differences starting from the border if

234
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
differences starting from the border if
 

235
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,430
differences starting from the border if
it's an island

236
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
it's an island
 

237
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,590
it's an island
right and then mark this as zero and

238
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
right and then mark this as zero and
 

239
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
right and then mark this as zero and
then we can do this

240
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,050

start with the border look further yeah

248
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
start with the border look further yeah
 

249
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,710
start with the border look further yeah
if it's one i do the definition i mark

250
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
if it's one i do the definition i mark
 

251
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,550
if it's one i do the definition i mark
it as zero

252
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
it as zero
 

253
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,270
it as zero
right here i mark it as zero here i

254
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
right here i mark it as zero here i
 

255
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:19,029
right here i mark it as zero here i
start here i mark it all zero

257
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,550

and then we just go through these ones

258
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
and then we just go through these ones
 

259
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,710
and then we just go through these ones
and count the rest that's right yeah do

all the islands connected to the border
 

279
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,390
all the islands connected to the border
are marked as zeros

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,430
we should define the deficit function
let's do it define define the first

342
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
let's do it define define the first
 

343
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,150
let's do it define define the first
search and then we have what we have

344
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
search and then we have what we have
 

345
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,950
search and then we have what we have
these rows and columns right yeah all

346
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
these rows and columns right yeah all
 

347
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,749
these rows and columns right yeah all
right

348
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
right
 

349
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,870
right
okay

350
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
okay
 

351
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,550
okay
look at me

352
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
look at me
 

353
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,189
look at me
so how can we check if this r and c's

354
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
so how can we check if this r and c's
 

355
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,790
so how can we check if this r and c's
within the border

356
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
within the border
 

357
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,629
within the border
okay so what's the what's the value

358
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
okay so what's the what's the value
 

359
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,550
okay so what's the what's the value
range of ah

360
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
range of ah
 

361
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,309
range of ah
what's the value range of c the rows

362
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
what's the value range of c the rows
 

363
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,749
what's the value range of c the rows
what's the value range of r

364
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
what's the value range of r
 

365
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,670
what's the value range of r
belongs to

366
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
belongs to
 

367
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:41,589
belongs to
start from zero to one

368
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599

 

369
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,830

yeah yeah yeah look

370
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
yeah yeah yeah look
 

371
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,270
yeah yeah yeah look
what's the difference between these and

372
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
what's the difference between these and
 

373
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,309
what's the difference between these and
these

374
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319

 

375
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,390

what does it mean this is r belongs to

376
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
what does it mean this is r belongs to
 

377
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,629
what does it mean this is r belongs to
zero to that's the range lower bar upper

378
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
zero to that's the range lower bar upper
 

379
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,390
zero to that's the range lower bar upper
bound but i use the square bracket and i

380
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
bound but i use the square bracket and i
 

381
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,629
bound but i use the square bracket and i
just put the things here can you guess

382
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
just put the things here can you guess
 

383
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,390
just put the things here can you guess
what's the difference can you sit down

384
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
what's the difference can you sit down
 

385
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,909
what's the difference can you sit down
why are you so busy ryan

386
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919

 

387
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,070

no no no mutable is in there this is

388
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
no no no mutable is in there this is
 

389
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,710
no no no mutable is in there this is
inclusive this is exclusive it means

390
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
inclusive this is exclusive it means
 

391
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,270
inclusive this is exclusive it means
that you can have r equals to 0 but you

392
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
that you can have r equals to 0 but you
 

393
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,909
that you can have r equals to 0 but you
can't have r equals to rows so what's

394
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
can't have r equals to rows so what's
 

395
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,550
can't have r equals to rows so what's
the maximum value of r

396
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
the maximum value of r
 

397
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,150
the maximum value of r
what's the maximum right if it comes

398
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
what's the maximum right if it comes
 

399
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,390
what's the maximum right if it comes
with rows

400
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
with rows
 

401
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,629
with rows
none of the maximum

402
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
none of the maximum
 

403
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,510
none of the maximum
the maximum r is what i said i just say

404
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
the maximum r is what i said i just say
 

405
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,430
the maximum r is what i said i just say
it can't be rows so what's the maximum

406
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
it can't be rows so what's the maximum
 

407
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,710
it can't be rows so what's the maximum
no no no leave here come on cielo to r

408
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
no no no leave here come on cielo to r
 

409
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,029
no no no leave here come on cielo to r
rose what it can't be wrong so what's

410
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
rose what it can't be wrong so what's
 

411
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,230
rose what it can't be wrong so what's
the biggest number that can't be rose

412
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
the biggest number that can't be rose
 

413
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,190
the biggest number that can't be rose
um

414
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
um
 

415
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,709
um
rose wha

416
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
rose wha
 

417
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:46,070
rose wha
roy

418
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080

 

419
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,110

yeah

420
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
yeah
 

421
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,269
yeah
okay and then these columns what's the

422
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:49,279
okay and then these columns what's the
 

423
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,790
okay and then these columns what's the
range it's the same zero two columns

424
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
range it's the same zero two columns
 

425
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,710
range it's the same zero two columns
so what's the maximum of c

426
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720

 

427
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,790

columns

428
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
columns
 

429
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,430
columns
columns are it can't be equal to columns

430
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
columns are it can't be equal to columns
 

431
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,070
columns are it can't be equal to columns
so yes

432
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
so yes
 

433
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,949
so yes
column minus one minus one okay okay

434
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
column minus one minus one okay okay
 

435
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,829
column minus one minus one okay okay
so if it's out of range look

436
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
so if it's out of range look
 

437
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,110
so if it's out of range look
if r

438
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
if r
 

439
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,150
if r
is smaller than zero or c is smaller

440
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
is smaller than zero or c is smaller
 

441
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,070
is smaller than zero or c is smaller
than zero or

442
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
than zero or
 

443
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,269
than zero or
r

444
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
r
 

445
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,829
r
equal rows or bigger equal rows

446
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
equal rows or bigger equal rows
 

447
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,870
equal rows or bigger equal rows
or c bigger or equal columns what should

448
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
or c bigger or equal columns what should
 

449
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,389
or c bigger or equal columns what should
we do we just return here because it's

450
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
we do we just return here because it's
 

451
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,470
we do we just return here because it's
out of range right we're doing with the

452
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
out of range right we're doing with the
 

453
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,790
out of range right we're doing with the
first search so now i just need to make

454
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
first search so now i just need to make
 

455
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,470
first search so now i just need to make
this pixel at rc equals to then to zero

456
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
this pixel at rc equals to then to zero
 

457
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,430
this pixel at rc equals to then to zero
right

458
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
right
 

459
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,030
right
so m

460
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
so m
 

461
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,550
so m
ah c equals zero right

462
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
ah c equals zero right
 

463
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,470
ah c equals zero right
okay so now at this point so what should

464
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
okay so now at this point so what should
 

465
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,470
okay so now at this point so what should
we do we we need to do the definition in

466
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
we do we we need to do the definition in
 

467
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,990
we do we we need to do the definition in
fourth direction right

468
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
fourth direction right
 

469
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,710
fourth direction right
okay so calorie therefore search

470
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
okay so calorie therefore search
 

471
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,790
okay so calorie therefore search
r plus one c

472
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
r plus one c
 

473
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,150
r plus one c
that's what search

474
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
that's what search
 

475
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,710
that's what search
rc plus one can you tell me what's next

476
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
rc plus one can you tell me what's next
 

477
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,310
rc plus one can you tell me what's next
that's my search what

478
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320

 

479
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,150

um

480
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160

 

481
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,430

now the r plus one c r c plus one and

482
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
now the r plus one c r c plus one and
 

483
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,509
now the r plus one c r c plus one and
then what what is r minus one c

484
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
then what what is r minus one c
 

485
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,910
then what what is r minus one c
right and therefore wait what do you

486
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
right and therefore wait what do you
 

487
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,630
right and therefore wait what do you
mean oh yeah i was about to say what's d

488
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
mean oh yeah i was about to say what's d
 

489
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,030
mean oh yeah i was about to say what's d
r

490
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040

 

491
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,990

what s

492
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
what s
 

493
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,389
what s
minus one yeah is it enough right look

494
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
minus one yeah is it enough right look
 

495
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,630
minus one yeah is it enough right look
at this at this point it's rc yeah i'm

496
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
at this at this point it's rc yeah i'm
 

497
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,030
at this at this point it's rc yeah i'm
here at this point

498
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
here at this point
 

499
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,750
here at this point
so what's what's r plus one c r plus one

500
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
so what's what's r plus one c r plus one
 

501
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,350
so what's what's r plus one c r plus one
c is here right

502
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360
c is here right
 

503
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,110
c is here right
look at this here

504
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
look at this here
 

505
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,470
look at this here
rc plus one ah c plus one is here

506
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
rc plus one ah c plus one is here
 

507
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,470
rc plus one ah c plus one is here
r minus one c is

508
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
r minus one c is
 

509
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,590
r minus one c is
here

510
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
here
 

511
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,670
here
ah c minus one

512
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
ah c minus one
 

513
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,310
ah c minus one
yeah right so it's four direction yeah

514
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
yeah right so it's four direction yeah
 

515
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,710
yeah right so it's four direction yeah
yeah you can do this in four direction i

516
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
yeah you can do this in four direction i
 

517
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,030
yeah you can do this in four direction i
just do this in four direction

518
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
just do this in four direction
 

519
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,030
just do this in four direction
but we look

520
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
but we look
 

521
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,949
but we look
you you can do a loop yeah you can just

522
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
you you can do a loop yeah you can just
 

523
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,069
you you can do a loop yeah you can just
do this

524
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
do this
 

525
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,190
do this
for

526
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
for
 

527
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,389
for
c x

528
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
c x
 

529
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,269
c x
b y in inward what's the x what's d y

530
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
b y in inward what's the x what's d y
 

531
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,790
b y in inward what's the x what's d y
yeah good point it's just the two

532
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
yeah good point it's just the two
 

533
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,509
yeah good point it's just the two
variables to define the the opposite

534
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
variables to define the the opposite
 

535
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,030
variables to define the the opposite
yeah different

536
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
yeah different
 

537
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,710
yeah different
look

538
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
look
 

539
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,350
look
zero minus one

540
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
zero minus one
 

541
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,670
zero minus one
minus one zero

542
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
minus one zero
 

543
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,350
minus one zero
zero one

544
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
zero one
 

545
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,750
zero one
and then one zero yeah in four direction

546
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
and then one zero yeah in four direction
 

547
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,710
and then one zero yeah in four direction
and then

548
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
and then
 

549
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,670
and then
to what

550
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
to what
 

551
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,750
to what
d f s

552
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
d f s
 

553
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,150
d f s
r plus d x look and then c plus d y you

554
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
r plus d x look and then c plus d y you
 

555
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,550
r plus d x look and then c plus d y you
see so you can transfer this to this

556
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
see so you can transfer this to this
 

557
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,790
see so you can transfer this to this
because look look at this this is a

558
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
because look look at this this is a
 

559
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,829
because look look at this this is a
tuper

560
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
tuper
 

561
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,790
tuper
with

562
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
with
 

563
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,790
with
with four vectors for empty

564
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
with four vectors for empty
 

565
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,110
with four vectors for empty
the opposite of rows the offset of

566
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
the opposite of rows the offset of
 

567
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,269
the opposite of rows the offset of
columns right can you look at me yes

568
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
columns right can you look at me yes
 

569
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,790
columns right can you look at me yes
yeah okay

570
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
yeah okay
 

571
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,110
yeah okay
if i do this and then

572
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
if i do this and then
 

573
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,949
if i do this and then
this is the default search okay i'm

574
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:44,959
this is the default search okay i'm
 

575
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,509
this is the default search okay i'm
going to write this here a little bit

576
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
going to write this here a little bit
 

577
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,790
going to write this here a little bit
oh

578
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
oh
 

579
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,030
oh
are smaller than zero or c smaller than

580
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
are smaller than zero or c smaller than
 

581
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,150
are smaller than zero or c smaller than
zero or c bigger than equal rows or row

582
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
zero or c bigger than equal rows or row
 

583
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:03,590
zero or c bigger than equal rows or row
r bigger or equal

584
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600

 

585
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,069

this is what what does this mean out of

586
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
this is what what does this mean out of
 

587
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,949
this is what what does this mean out of
range yeah out of

588
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
range yeah out of
 

589
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,069
range yeah out of
because then range

590
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
because then range
 

591
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,030
because then range
ic is out of the board and then i mark

592
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
ic is out of the board and then i mark
 

593
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,750
ic is out of the board and then i mark
it as visited i mark it as the zero mark

594
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
it as visited i mark it as the zero mark
 

595
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,629
it as visited i mark it as the zero mark
it as

596
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:16,639
it as
 

597
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,069
it as
water okay

598
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,079
water okay

right i want to definitely i want to
 

601
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,150
right i want to definitely i want to
mark it what and then this one going

602
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
mark it what and then this one going
 

603
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,069
mark it what and then this one going
through four directions yeah going into

604
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
through four directions yeah going into
 

605
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,590
through four directions yeah going into
four direction

606
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
four direction
 

607
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,790
four direction
okay

608

okay
 

609
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,629
okay
okay so this is different search and now

610
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639
okay so this is different search and now
 

611
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,870
okay so this is different search and now
i just need to travel the border how do

so in a border like if it

680
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
so in a border like if it
 

681
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,629
so in a border like if it
if in the border i do the definition but

682
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
if in the border i do the definition but
 

683
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,670
if in the border i do the definition but
it's better you put it here if if m

684
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
it's better you put it here if if m
 

685
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,069
it's better you put it here if if m
ah c right if it's the length you do the

686
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
ah c right if it's the length you do the
 

687
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,230
ah c right if it's the length you do the
difference right if it's not a length i

688
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
difference right if it's not a length i
 

689
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,829
difference right if it's not a length i
don't know the difference here if this

690
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
don't know the difference here if this
 

691
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,910
don't know the difference here if this
is one i do the difference right what's

692
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
is one i do the difference right what's
 

693
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,910
is one i do the difference right what's
the term complexity in this one if

694
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
the term complexity in this one if
 

695
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,550
the term complexity in this one if
there's a two loop here

696
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
there's a two loop here
 

697
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,110
there's a two loop here
oh

698
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120

 

699
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,269

also sometimes

700
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
also sometimes
 

701
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,790
also sometimes
there are two

702
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
there are two
 

703
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,910
there are two
square

704
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
square
 

705
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,870
square
un square all you are rows rows times

706
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
un square all you are rows rows times
 

707
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,590
un square all you are rows rows times
columns okay it's better to be exact

708
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
columns okay it's better to be exact
 

709
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,910
columns okay it's better to be exact
yeah lowers the terms columns can we do

710
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
yeah lowers the terms columns can we do
 

711
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,910
yeah lowers the terms columns can we do
can we do better in just this bit can we

712
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
can we do better in just this bit can we
 

713
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,269
can we do better in just this bit can we
do better

714
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
do better
 

715
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,550
do better
yeah

716
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
yeah
 

717
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,110
yeah
can we do better do we need to visit any

718
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
can we do better do we need to visit any
 

719
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,870
can we do better do we need to visit any
of these in the middle

720
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
of these in the middle
 

721
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,389
of these in the middle
do we need to go through anything in the

722
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:46,399
do we need to go through anything in the
 

723
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,230
do we need to go through anything in the
middle because it's not bothered good

724
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
middle because it's not bothered good
 

725
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,230
middle because it's not bothered good
job it's not bother so we can just skip

726
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
job it's not bother so we can just skip
 

727
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,550
job it's not bother so we can just skip
it right we can turn this into two for

728
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
it right we can turn this into two for
 

729
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,430
it right we can turn this into two for
loop

730
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
loop
 

731
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,629
loop
so for

732
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
so for
 

733
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,389
so for
r in

734
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
r in
 

735
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,069
r in
range

736
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
range
 

737
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,230
range
rows right look

738
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,240
rows right look
 

739
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,509
rows right look
range rows

740
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519

 

741
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,710

so

742
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
so
 

743
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,990
so
rook r is from zero to rows so what what

744
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000
rook r is from zero to rows so what what
 

745
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,829
rook r is from zero to rows so what what
should i do i should just do this

746
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
should i do i should just do this
 

747
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,629
should i do i should just do this
massage

748
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:14,639

 

749
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,350

what's the column of this one

750
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
what's the column of this one
 

751
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,760
what's the column of this one
um

752
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:19,770

 

753
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,030

[Music]

754
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
[Music]
 

755
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,430
[Music]
yeah yeah look at i is from the rose

756
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
yeah yeah look at i is from the rose
 

757
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,230
yeah yeah look at i is from the rose
and i also need to do this right what's

758
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,240
and i also need to do this right what's
 

759
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,710
and i also need to do this right what's
the column

760
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
the column
 

761
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,389
the column
um

762
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
um
 

763
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,189
um
yeah

764
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
yeah
 

765
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,470
yeah
look because i'm i i iterate the r

766
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
look because i'm i i iterate the r
 

767
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,030
look because i'm i i iterate the r
color minus one you see okay so and now

768
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
color minus one you see okay so and now
 

769
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,790
color minus one you see okay so and now
i need to iterate these two right so

770
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
i need to iterate these two right so
 

771
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,629
i need to iterate these two right so
look for c in range

772
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
look for c in range
 

773
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,150
look for c in range
columns yeah

774
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
columns yeah
 

775
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,670
columns yeah
d f s

776
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
d f s
 

777
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,350
d f s
so what's this one what's the row of

778
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
so what's this one what's the row of
 

779
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,509
so what's this one what's the row of
this one what's the row number of this

780
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
this one what's the row number of this
 

781
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,430
this one what's the row number of this
one

782
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
one
 

783
00:15:51,440 --> 00:16:02,150
one
what's your row number of the first one

784
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160

 

785
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,749

what's the rules of this one

786
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759

 

787
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,389

r minus rows minus one c

788
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
r minus rows minus one c
 

789
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,269
r minus rows minus one c
you see these turn into this these two

790
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279
you see these turn into this these two
 

791
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,030
you see these turn into this these two
four so what's the time complexity of

792
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,040
four so what's the time complexity of
 

793
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,670
four so what's the time complexity of
this one if i don't

794
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
this one if i don't
 

795
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,150
this one if i don't
don't consider the the content of that

796
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
don't consider the the content of that
 

797
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,949
don't consider the the content of that
so

798
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959
so
 

799
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,430
so
so what's the time complexity of these

800
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
so what's the time complexity of these
 

801
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,150
so what's the time complexity of these
these two this equine and this aggregate

802
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
these two this equine and this aggregate
 

803
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,310
these two this equine and this aggregate
yeah ignoring the default search okay

804
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
yeah ignoring the default search okay
 

805
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,509
yeah ignoring the default search okay
what's the time consumption this is all

806
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
what's the time consumption this is all
 

807
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,550
what's the time consumption this is all
asian what's this

808
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560

 

809
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,749

this is

810
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
this is
 

811
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,790
this is
ah

812
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
ah
 

813
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,030
ah
and this is c so so what you are putting

814
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
and this is c so so what you are putting
 

815
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,470
and this is c so so what you are putting
in the middle

816
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
in the middle
 

817
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,069
in the middle
there are two four loops

818
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
there are two four loops
 

819
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,230
there are two four loops
separate independent plus yeah where

820
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
separate independent plus yeah where
 

821
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,910
separate independent plus yeah where
there you see you do this and two lists

822
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
there you see you do this and two lists
 

823
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,670
there you see you do this and two lists
so it starts together but this one is

824
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
so it starts together but this one is
 

825
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,670
so it starts together but this one is
what you do this for each one of these

826
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
what you do this for each one of these
 

827
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,389
what you do this for each one of these
you do this so it's multiplied yeah

828
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
you do this so it's multiplied yeah
 

829
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,870
you do this so it's multiplied yeah
make sense which one is better r

830
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
make sense which one is better r
 

831
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,069
make sense which one is better r
of course r plus three okay good job

832
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
of course r plus three okay good job
 

833
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,829
of course r plus three okay good job
okay so yeah we're going back it's a

834
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
okay so yeah we're going back it's a
 

835
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,350
okay so yeah we're going back it's a
different search right now we mark all

836
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
different search right now we mark all
 

837
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,990
different search right now we mark all
uh all all the land connected with

838
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
uh all all the land connected with
 

839
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,670
uh all all the land connected with
border into zero and now what should we

840
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
border into zero and now what should we
 

841
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,909
border into zero and now what should we
do next we just have to

842
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
do next we just have to
 

843
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,909

what goes to the middle do i do we need
 

859
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,150
what goes to the middle do i do we need
to go through that board again

860
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
to go through that board again
 

861
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,990
to go through that board again
do we need to go to the ball again now

what does these two what's the

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,710
what does these two what's the

difference between i think one of them
 

935
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,870
difference between i think one of them
is that inclusion

936
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
is that inclusion
 

937
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,430
is that inclusion
and believing one of them is

938
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
and believing one of them is
 

939
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,590
and believing one of them is
above the six under

940
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
above the six under
 

941
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,750
above the six under
no inclusion means that contains it

942
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:49,760
no inclusion means that contains it
 

943
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,310
no inclusion means that contains it
exclusive that does not contain it okay

944
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
exclusive that does not contain it okay
 

945
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,310
exclusive that does not contain it okay
so 210 means that

[Music]
 

1021
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,549
[Music]
why can you tell me why well why can't

1022
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:02,559
why can you tell me why well why can't
 

1023
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,510
why can you tell me why well why can't
you tell me well

1024
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,520
you tell me well
 

1025
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,110
you tell me well
because each each pixel is visited

1026
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
because each each pixel is visited
 

1027
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,549
because each each pixel is visited
exactly how many times i'll say

1028
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
exactly how many times i'll say
 

1029
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,830
exactly how many times i'll say
no no there are times the pixels and i'm

1030
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:15,840
no no there are times the pixels and i'm
 

1031
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,710
no no there are times the pixels and i'm
saying each pixel is on

1032
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
saying each pixel is on
 

1033
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,350
saying each pixel is on
constant time so that's all i see yeah

1034
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
constant time so that's all i see yeah
 

1035
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,390
constant time so that's all i see yeah
got it

1036
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
got it
 

1037
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,310
got it
okay so can you tell me how do we do

1038
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
okay so can you tell me how do we do
 

1039
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,750
okay so can you tell me how do we do
this just

1040
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:25,760
this just
 

1041
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,029
this just
you don't need to write the code just

1042
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:27,039
you don't need to write the code just
 

1043
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,789
you don't need to write the code just
tell me how do you what do you learn

1044
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
tell me how do you what do you learn
 

1045
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,190
tell me how do you what do you learn
today if you want to find a if you want

1046
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
today if you want to find a if you want
 

1047
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,149
today if you want to find a if you want
to find

1048
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
to find
 

1049
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,350
to find
uh

1050
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,360

 

1051
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,470

the

1052
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
the
 

1053
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,549
the
what

1054
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
what
 

1055
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,909
what
if you want to find the number of

1056
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
if you want to find the number of
 

1057
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,310
if you want to find the number of
surrounded island which is only this one

1058
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
surrounded island which is only this one
 

1059
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,270
surrounded island which is only this one
right yeah so how do we compute how do

1060
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
right yeah so how do we compute how do
 

1061
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,430
right yeah so how do we compute how do
we call the number of surroundings

1062
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440

 

1063
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,830

okay i'm gonna break this

1064
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
okay i'm gonna break this
 

1065
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,430
okay i'm gonna break this
but

1066
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
but
 

1067
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,990
but
we first of all start doing the theft

1068
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
we first of all start doing the theft
 

1069
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,549
we first of all start doing the theft
search and mark the length as zero by

1070
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
search and mark the length as zero by
 

1071
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,110
search and mark the length as zero by
following the border right yeah

1072
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
following the border right yeah
 

1073
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,390
following the border right yeah
okay and then oh look after this uh look

1074
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,400
okay and then oh look after this uh look
 

1075
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,990
okay and then oh look after this uh look
what happens if i do the difference

1076
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,000
what happens if i do the difference
 

1077
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,870
what happens if i do the difference
which two bits will become zero

1078
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880
which two bits will become zero
 

1079
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,990
which two bits will become zero

[Music]
 

1081
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,549
[Music]
these two okay and then i start in like

1082
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
these two okay and then i start in like
 

1083
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,549
these two okay and then i start in like
in the middle one yeah

1084
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:16,559
in the middle one yeah
 

1085
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,390
in the middle one yeah
yeah yeah i start from the middle one

1086
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400
yeah yeah i start from the middle one
 

1087
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,710
yeah yeah i start from the middle one
yeah i only start here pixel five pixel

1088
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
yeah i only start here pixel five pixel
 

1089
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,390
yeah i only start here pixel five pixel
and if it's one

1090
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,400
and if it's one
 

1091
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,630
and if it's one
i do the different session mark

1092
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
i do the different session mark
 

1093
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,990
i do the different session mark
connected pieces to zlo and then i do

1094
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000
connected pieces to zlo and then i do
 

1095
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,789
connected pieces to zlo and then i do
the

1096
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
the
 

1097
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,350
the
increment answer right and pretend the

1098
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360
increment answer right and pretend the
 

1099
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,669
increment answer right and pretend the
answer okay the time complexity because

1100
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
answer okay the time complexity because
 

1101
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,230
answer okay the time complexity because
each pixel is divisive

1102
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240
each pixel is divisive
 

1103
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,990
each pixel is divisive
a constant of time okay that's it for

1104
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,000
a constant of time okay that's it for
 

1105
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,559
a constant of time okay that's it for
today good job bye bye
