hello mr ryan
we're not a teacher okay yeah can you

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:08,800
we're not a teacher okay yeah can you
 

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,230
we're not a teacher okay yeah can you
say mister

8
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
say mister
 

9
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,709
say mister
okay so today we talk about

10
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
okay so today we talk about
 

11
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,710
okay so today we talk about
using a binary search remember we are

12
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
using a binary search remember we are
 

13
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,990
using a binary search remember we are
very interesting in

14
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
very interesting in
 

15
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,950
very interesting in
interest in this binary search to find

16
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
interest in this binary search to find
 

17
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,590
interest in this binary search to find
out

18
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
out
 

19
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,710
out
the case largest number

20
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:24,720
the case largest number
 

21
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,429
the case largest number
in yellow okay so for example like if

22
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:27,439
in yellow okay so for example like if
 

23
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:27,750
in yellow okay so for example like if
this

24
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
this
 

25
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,269
this
is the three four two

26
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
is the three four two
 

27
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,870
is the three four two
one six nine what's the

28
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
one six nine what's the
 

29
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,310
one six nine what's the
third largest number

30
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
third largest number
 

31
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,389
third largest number
four two four third

32
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
four two four third
 

33
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,590
four two four third
largest three four four is before

34
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
largest three four four is before
 

35
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,350
largest three four four is before
nine four yeah okay so one way of doing

36
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
nine four yeah okay so one way of doing
 

37
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,189
nine four yeah okay so one way of doing
it at any size how do we do it

38
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
it at any size how do we do it
 

39
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,189
it at any size how do we do it
uh we can

40
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
uh we can
 

41
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,870
uh we can
we may find the largest

42
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:01,880

 

43
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:10,230

[Music]

44
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240

 

45
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,310

we can make this already for example if

46
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320
we can make this already for example if
 

47
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,910
we can make this already for example if
this is nums yeah

48
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
this is nums yeah
 

49
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,030
this is nums yeah
we can do this define okay let's say

50
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
we can do this define okay let's say
 

51
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,350
we can do this define okay let's say
k largest yeah k is largest okay

52
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
k largest yeah k is largest okay
 

53
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,469
k largest yeah k is largest okay
and this is numbers yeah and then that's

54
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
and this is numbers yeah and then that's
 

55
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,230
and this is numbers yeah and then that's
okay okay so we can do this

56
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
okay okay so we can do this
 

57
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,429
okay okay so we can do this
lam dot sword yeah

58
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
lam dot sword yeah
 

59
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,830
lam dot sword yeah
so we make it in order so that will be

60
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
so we make it in order so that will be
 

61
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,109
so we make it in order so that will be
that will become

62
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
that will become
 

63
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,469
that will become
nine six four three two

64
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
nine six four three two
 

65
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,950
nine six four three two
one yeah when you're doing this the

66
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
one yeah when you're doing this the
 

67
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,069
one yeah when you're doing this the
numbers will become

68
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
numbers will become
 

69
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,950
numbers will become
slick yeah and then you just need to

70
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
slick yeah and then you just need to
 

71
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,270
slick yeah and then you just need to
return

72
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
return
 

73
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,550
return
lumps what no

74
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
lumps what no
 

75
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,389
lumps what no
actually it would be reverse it would be

76
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
actually it would be reverse it would be
 

77
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,069
actually it would be reverse it would be
because dumb soft sword

78
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
because dumb soft sword
 

79
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,510
because dumb soft sword
it will be this will be one two three

80
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
it will be this will be one two three
 

81
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,069
it will be this will be one two three
you'll be

82
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
you'll be
 

83
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,310
you'll be
increasing order if you want to make it

84
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
increasing order if you want to make it
 

85
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,109
increasing order if you want to make it
in the

86
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
in the
 

87
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,350
in the
descending order you have to put it put

88
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
descending order you have to put it put
 

89
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,389
descending order you have to put it put
a key

90
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
a key
 

91
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,590
a key
reverse equals two okay

92
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
reverse equals two okay
 

93
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,270
reverse equals two okay
so after this it will become this and

94
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
so after this it will become this and
 

95
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,830
so after this it will become this and
then what we return is returns one

96
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
then what we return is returns one
 

97
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,190
then what we return is returns one
the third largest number so that would

98
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
the third largest number so that would
 

99
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,110
the third largest number so that would
be k minus one right because it starts

100
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
be k minus one right because it starts
 

101
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,670
be k minus one right because it starts
with the

102
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
with the
 

103
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,309
with the
zero third number will be zero one two

104
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
zero third number will be zero one two
 

105
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,110
zero third number will be zero one two
which is one

106
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
which is one
 

107
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,710
which is one
right right or or if you want

108
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
right right or or if you want
 

109
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,630
right right or or if you want
if you don't want to do this then you'll

110
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
if you don't want to do this then you'll
 

111
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,110
if you don't want to do this then you'll
become these numbers will become one two

112
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
become these numbers will become one two
 

113
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,589
become these numbers will become one two
three

114
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
three
 

115
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,030
three
four nine six and then

116
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
four nine six and then
 

117
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,150
four nine six and then
instead of lumps k minus one is

118
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
instead of lumps k minus one is
 

119
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,750
instead of lumps k minus one is
numbs minus k you see using the negative

120
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
numbs minus k you see using the negative
 

121
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,110
numbs minus k you see using the negative
index so it means i want to use the

122
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
index so it means i want to use the
 

123
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,589
index so it means i want to use the
k numbers from the other side so the

124
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
k numbers from the other side so the
 

125
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,070
k numbers from the other side so the
third number to the end which is four

126
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
third number to the end which is four
 

127
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,790
third number to the end which is four
okay so this is two lines of code you

128
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
okay so this is two lines of code you
 

129
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,030
okay so this is two lines of code you
can do this so get the

130
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
can do this so get the
 

131
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,750
can do this so get the
largest number in an array but today

132
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
largest number in an array but today
 

133
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,190
largest number in an array but today
we're going to use the final research

134
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
we're going to use the final research
 

135
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,670
we're going to use the final research
so what's the complexity of that sorting

136
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
so what's the complexity of that sorting
 

137
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,100
so what's the complexity of that sorting
remember

138
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,110
remember
 

139
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,350

n log n yes what do we talk about

142
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
n log n yes what do we talk about
 

143
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,990
n log n yes what do we talk about
when we talk about sorting is log and

144
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
when we talk about sorting is log and
 

145
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,949
when we talk about sorting is log and
log o

146
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
log o
 

147
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,990
log o
and log n because it uses quick thought

148
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
and log n because it uses quick thought
 

149
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,110
and log n because it uses quick thought
yeah sometimes quicker sort combined

150
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
yeah sometimes quicker sort combined
 

151
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,710
yeah sometimes quicker sort combined
with some other simple soft or

152
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
with some other simple soft or
 

153
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,270
with some other simple soft or
multi-slot yeah

154
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
multi-slot yeah
 

155
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,430
multi-slot yeah
usually when we talk about assaulting is

156
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
usually when we talk about assaulting is
 

157
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,550
usually when we talk about assaulting is
overlooked n log

158
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
overlooked n log
 

159
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,190
overlooked n log
and n is the number of elements in the

160
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
and n is the number of elements in the
 

161
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,830
and n is the number of elements in the
array

162
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
array
 

163
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,149
array
okay yes okay so now

164
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
okay yes okay so now
 

165
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,430
okay yes okay so now
if we want to do uh do this test using

166
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
if we want to do uh do this test using
 

167
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,430
if we want to do uh do this test using
the binary search we can do it like

168
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
the binary search we can do it like
 

169
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,509
the binary search we can do it like
if i have given a function like count

170
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519

 

171

00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
does it mean
 

195
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,150
does it mean
what does this function try to do this

196
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
what does this function try to do this
 

197
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,870

number this
 

199
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,070
number this
is the number we just talked about 3 4 2

200
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
is the number we just talked about 3 4 2
 

201
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,310
is the number we just talked about 3 4 2
1 9 6 and actually let's say

202
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
1 9 6 and actually let's say
 

203
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,150
1 9 6 and actually let's say
x is 2 so what does it mean

204
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
x is 2 so what does it mean
 

205
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,150
x is 2 so what does it mean
answer equals 0 for i in numbers

206
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
answer equals 0 for i in numbers
 

207
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,749
answer equals 0 for i in numbers
if i is bigger than x2 then answer plus

208
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
if i is bigger than x2 then answer plus
 

209
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,469
if i is bigger than x2 then answer plus
one

210
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
one
 

211
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,310
one
they can answer what does it mean

212
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320

 

213
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,510

what does this function mean ryan any

214
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
what does this function mean ryan any
 

215
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,469
what does this function mean ryan any
thoughts

216
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
thoughts
 

217
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,469
thoughts
any things what's this mean what's this

218
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
any things what's this mean what's this
 

219
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:06,230
any things what's this mean what's this
once you mean

220
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240

 

221
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,950

and then i look into i iterate all the

222
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
and then i look into i iterate all the
 

223
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,070
and then i look into i iterate all the
numbers and i check

224
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
numbers and i check
 

225
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,270
numbers and i check
if the number is bigger than uh 2x oh

226
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
if the number is bigger than uh 2x oh
 

227
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,870
if the number is bigger than uh 2x oh
those are the numbers

228
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
those are the numbers
 

229
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,590
those are the numbers
no another i can't what's this what is

230
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
no another i can't what's this what is
 

231
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,350
no another i can't what's this what is
this

232
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
this
 

233
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,230
this
count how many equals okay so what does

234
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
count how many equals okay so what does
 

235
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,590
count how many equals okay so what does
this function do

236
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
this function do
 

237
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,710
this function do
count how many people

238
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
count how many people
 

239
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,270
count how many people
than that number so it's easier i need

240
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
than that number so it's easier i need
 

241
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,629
than that number so it's easier i need
to release numbers

242
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
to release numbers
 

243
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,870
to release numbers
and then i check if it's bigger than x

244
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
and then i check if it's bigger than x
 

245
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,870
and then i check if it's bigger than x
then i count it right

246
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
then i count it right
 

247
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,790
then i count it right
does it make sense i mean this is the

248
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
does it make sense i mean this is the
 

249
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,909
does it make sense i mean this is the
very simplest

250
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
very simplest
 

251
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,070
very simplest
function yeah i easily i go through

252
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
function yeah i easily i go through
 

253
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,189
function yeah i easily i go through
these numbers

254
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
these numbers
 

255
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,950
these numbers
i check if the number i is bigger than

256
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
i check if the number i is bigger than
 

257
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,390
i check if the number i is bigger than
x then if it is i can't increment the

258
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
x then if it is i can't increment the
 

259
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,029
x then if it is i can't increment the
answers and i return this answer yes

260
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
answers and i return this answer yes
 

261
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,390
answers and i return this answer yes
yes the counter what's the complexity i

262
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
yes the counter what's the complexity i
 

263
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,670
yes the counter what's the complexity i
and i log in i end again

264
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680

 

265
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,590

yeah because i iterate these numbers

266
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
yeah because i iterate these numbers
 

267
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,029
yeah because i iterate these numbers
only once right

268
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
only once right
 

269
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,350
only once right
yes yeah that's very easy okay very

270
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
yes yeah that's very easy okay very
 

271
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,230
yes yeah that's very easy okay very
simple

272
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
simple
 

273
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,950
simple
okay so now with this function so now

274
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
okay so now with this function so now
 

275
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,670
okay so now with this function so now
now what how can i do this the binaries

276
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
now what how can i do this the binaries
 

277
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,110
now what how can i do this the binaries
i mean final research

278
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
i mean final research
 

279
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,590
i mean final research
i can do this mean uh if these are

280
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
i can do this mean uh if these are
 

281
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,550
i can do this mean uh if these are
numbers yeah

282
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
numbers yeah
 

283
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,670
numbers yeah
these are numbers three two one

284
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
these are numbers three two one
 

285
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,790
these are numbers three two one
nine six seven

286
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
nine six seven
 

287
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,830
nine six seven
so now what's the minimum number of

288
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
so now what's the minimum number of
 

289
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,390
so now what's the minimum number of
leads on all these

290
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
leads on all these
 

291
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,510
leads on all these
one yeah so i have a left bound

292
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
one yeah so i have a left bound
 

293
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,430
one yeah so i have a left bound
equals mean mean numb

294
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
equals mean mean numb
 

295
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,909
equals mean mean numb
which will become one right and right

296
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
which will become one right and right
 

297
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,469
which will become one right and right
bound

298
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
bound
 

299
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,230
bound
can you guess what should i write max

300
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
can you guess what should i write max
 

301
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,749
can you guess what should i write max
we're done numbs which will be

302
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
we're done numbs which will be
 

303
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,309
we're done numbs which will be
nine nine okay so now let's bounce right

304
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
nine nine okay so now let's bounce right
 

305
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,870
nine nine okay so now let's bounce right
down and i if i do this meter

306
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:52,880
down and i if i do this meter
 

307
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,510
down and i if i do this meter
i do this middle and then i can use the

308
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
i do this middle and then i can use the
 

309
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,430
i do this middle and then i can use the
function i just created count how many

310
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
function i just created count how many
 

311
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,990
function i just created count how many
numbers are bigger than all equal meter

312
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
numbers are bigger than all equal meter
 

313
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,029
numbers are bigger than all equal meter
right yes then

314
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
right yes then
 

315
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,550
right yes then
look now i can say x equals count

316
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
look now i can say x equals count
 

317
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,589
look now i can say x equals count
how many then that is

318
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
how many then that is
 

319
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,629
how many then that is
x then here it will be finally yeah y

320
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
x then here it will be finally yeah y
 

321
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,230
x then here it will be finally yeah y
left smaller equals right right

322
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
left smaller equals right right
 

323
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,870
left smaller equals right right
and then meet the equals i get the

324
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
and then meet the equals i get the
 

325
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,189
and then meet the equals i get the
middle yeah left plus right

326
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
middle yeah left plus right
 

327
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,670
middle yeah left plus right
divided by two okay yeah middle if x

328
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
divided by two okay yeah middle if x
 

329
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,790
divided by two okay yeah middle if x
if x if there are more than k numbers

330
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
if x if there are more than k numbers
 

331
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,070
if x if there are more than k numbers
more than k numbers

332
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
more than k numbers
 

333
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,150
more than k numbers
so what does it mean if there are more

334
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
so what does it mean if there are more
 

335
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,589
so what does it mean if there are more
than k numbers

336
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
than k numbers
 

337
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,749
than k numbers
that bigger than the current mid number

338
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
that bigger than the current mid number
 

339
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,150
that bigger than the current mid number
so what does it mean we need to reduce

340
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
so what does it mean we need to reduce
 

341
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,670
so what does it mean we need to reduce
the if we have more than 10 for example

342
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:47,680
the if we have more than 10 for example
 

343
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,629
the if we have more than 10 for example
if k is 3

344
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
if k is 3
 

345
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,150
if k is 3
and if there are four numbers bigger

346
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
and if there are four numbers bigger
 

347
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,990
and if there are four numbers bigger
for this column meter number if there

348
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
for this column meter number if there
 

349
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,670
for this column meter number if there
are four numbers bigger than it so i

350
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
are four numbers bigger than it so i
 

351
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,950
are four numbers bigger than it so i
need to reduce the

352
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
need to reduce the
 

353
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,510
need to reduce the
meat right so i i need to increase the

354
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
meat right so i i need to increase the
 

355
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,230
meat right so i i need to increase the
meat right

356
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
meat right
 

357
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,390
meat right
i'm right yeah because if i reduce the

358
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
i'm right yeah because if i reduce the
 

359
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,830
i'm right yeah because if i reduce the
meat then

360
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
meat then
 

361
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,070
meat then
then the x will become bigger which is

362
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
then the x will become bigger which is
 

363
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,189
then the x will become bigger which is
not what we want

364
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
not what we want
 

365
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,790
not what we want
so left becomes meter plus one right

366
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
so left becomes meter plus one right
 

367
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,830
so left becomes meter plus one right
and as can you guess what's this

368
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
and as can you guess what's this
 

369
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,670
and as can you guess what's this
left right right equals one

370
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
left right right equals one
 

371
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,869
left right right equals one
max minus one

372
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
max minus one
 

373
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,990
max minus one
yeah all right yes yes

374
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
yeah all right yes yes
 

375
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,270
yeah all right yes yes
oh okay one right we're done

376
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
oh okay one right we're done
 

377
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,310
oh okay one right we're done
this is a special case because right

378
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320

 

379
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,310

sometimes it's written left but in this

380
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
sometimes it's written left but in this
 

381
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,350
sometimes it's written left but in this
case we are returning

382
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
case we are returning
 

383
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,110
case we are returning
right which is because we need to minus

384
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
right which is because we need to minus
 

385
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,949
right which is because we need to minus
one to get this boundary right

386
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
one to get this boundary right
 

387
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,949
one to get this boundary right
okay yes so what's the complexity of all

388
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
okay yes so what's the complexity of all
 

389
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,949
okay yes so what's the complexity of all
together

390
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959

 

391
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,070

00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
this is o n right and the final research
 

397
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,829
this is o n right and the final research
is o

398
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
is o
 

399
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,190
is o
log n so all together o and again

log n so all together o and again
 

401
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,430
log n so all together o and again
all right okay good job okay let's do

now let's do this let's let's do these
numbers which is

442
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
numbers which is
 

443
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,550
numbers which is
just given some numbers okay and then

444
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
just given some numbers okay and then
 

445
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,949
just given some numbers okay and then
you tell me what's the answer okay

446
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
you tell me what's the answer okay
 

447
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,069
you tell me what's the answer okay
uh i'll duplicate no okay

448
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
uh i'll duplicate no okay
 

449
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,590
uh i'll duplicate no okay
define three k is largest

450
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
define three k is largest
 

451
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,949
define three k is largest
case slices two threes okay

452
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
case slices two threes okay
 

453
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,509
case slices two threes okay
let me make it one one three thirteen

454
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
let me make it one one three thirteen
 

455
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,790
let me make it one one three thirteen
okay so numbs

456
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
okay so numbs
 

457
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,670
okay so numbs
okay remember we we talked about they

458
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
okay remember we we talked about they
 

459
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,710
okay remember we we talked about they
saw team yeah

460
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
saw team yeah
 

461
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,110
saw team yeah
yeah yeah and now we can return

462
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
yeah yeah and now we can return
 

463
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,310
yeah yeah and now we can return
numbs minus k let's just try to see if

464
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
numbs minus k let's just try to see if
 

465
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,509
numbs minus k let's just try to see if
it's all right yeah

466
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
it's all right yeah
 

467
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,030
it's all right yeah
k is largest nums

468
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
k is largest nums
 

469
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,350
k is largest nums
let's say three okay the third largest

470
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
let's say three okay the third largest
 

471
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,670
let's say three okay the third largest
number is which is

472
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
number is which is
 

473
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,150
number is which is
seven seven yes all right

474
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160

 

475
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,430

uh uh oh i think i have a spelling error

476
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
uh uh oh i think i have a spelling error
 

477
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,550
uh uh oh i think i have a spelling error
so case largest okay

478
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
so case largest okay
 

479
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,269
so case largest okay
key slices okay so that's not what we i

480
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
key slices okay so that's not what we i
 

481
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,110
key slices okay so that's not what we i
want

482
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120

 

483
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,630

seven all right yes and you can do this

484
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
seven all right yes and you can do this
 

485
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,350
seven all right yes and you can do this
the

486
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
the
 

487
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,310
the
uh using salt the other way which is and

488
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
uh using salt the other way which is and
 

489
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,110
uh using salt the other way which is and
then you tell me

490
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,120
then you tell me
 

491
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,230
then you tell me
what's right and reverse

492
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
what's right and reverse
 

493
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,710
what's right and reverse
when i say reverse equals two is sorting

494
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:38,720
when i say reverse equals two is sorting
 

495
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,990
when i say reverse equals two is sorting
from the biggest to the

496
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
from the biggest to the
 

497
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,509
from the biggest to the
smallest so what should i put here

498
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
smallest so what should i put here
 

499
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,389
smallest so what should i put here
what should i put here okay yes we'll

500
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
what should i put here okay yes we'll
 

501
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:46,949
what should i put here okay yes we'll
add on k

502
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
add on k
 

503

also 27 okay
yes we're done you see so it's the same

596
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
yes we're done you see so it's the same
 

597
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:07,910
yes we're done you see so it's the same
yeah

598
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
yeah
 

599
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,189
yeah
it's the same let's get it is it

600
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
it's the same let's get it is it
 

601
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,430
it's the same let's get it is it
any question so far are you sure

602
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
any question so far are you sure
 

603
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,430
any question so far are you sure
what's the complexity of the card

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
what's the complexity of the card
 

605
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,550
what's the complexity of the card
function

606
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560

 

607
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,590

what's the complexity of case largest oh

608
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
what's the complexity of case largest oh
 

609
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,949
what's the complexity of case largest oh
log f no oh and log n because they use

610
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
log f no oh and log n because they use
 

611
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,870
log f no oh and log n because they use
the code from here look the call

612
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
the code from here look the call
 

613
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,550
the code from here look the call
function is o n

614
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
function is o n
 

615
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,269
function is o n
and this binary search is usually o log

616
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
and this binary search is usually o log
 

617
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:35,590
and this binary search is usually o log
n

618
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
n
 

619
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,350
n
so when it times it together you see

620
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
so when it times it together you see
 

621
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,790
so when it times it together you see
together it's o and log n

622
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
together it's o and log n
 

623
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,990
together it's o and log n
all right yes so what can you

624
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
all right yes so what can you
 

625
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,509
all right yes so what can you
tell me why when why they are more than

626
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
tell me why when why they are more than
 

627
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:45,829
tell me why when why they are more than
k

628
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:45,839
k
 

629
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,870
k
numbers larger than

630
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
numbers larger than
 

631
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,430
numbers larger than
the meat we need to increase the meat

632
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
the meat we need to increase the meat
 

633
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,389
the meat we need to increase the meat
because for example

634
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
because for example
 

635
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,150
because for example
we want we are interested in the third

636
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
we want we are interested in the third
 

637
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,389
we want we are interested in the third
largest number and then we found out for

638
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
largest number and then we found out for
 

639
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,590
largest number and then we found out for
this current meat there are five there

640
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
this current meat there are five there
 

641
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,389
this current meat there are five there
are five numbers bigger than the meat

642
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
are five numbers bigger than the meat
 

643
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,069
are five numbers bigger than the meat
so we are interested in the third

644
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
so we are interested in the third
 

645
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,509
so we are interested in the third
largest number and there are five

646
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
largest number and there are five
 

647
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,110
largest number and there are five
numbers bigger than the meat it means

648
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
numbers bigger than the meat it means
 

649
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,110
numbers bigger than the meat it means
that we need to increase the meat

650
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
that we need to increase the meat
 

651
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,310
that we need to increase the meat
so this x will be reduced right

652
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:12,320
so this x will be reduced right
 

653
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,069
so this x will be reduced right
when we increase the meat what should we

654
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
when we increase the meat what should we
 

655
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,069
when we increase the meat what should we
do we should search for the upper half

656
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
do we should search for the upper half
 

657
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:16,870
do we should search for the upper half
so that's why

658
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
so that's why
 

659
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,189
so that's why
we set the left boundary into the mid

660
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
we set the left boundary into the mid
 

661
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:19,990
we set the left boundary into the mid
plus one

662
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
plus one
 

663
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,670
plus one
then it was this meter will be

664
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
then it was this meter will be
 

665
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,110
then it was this meter will be
increasing

666
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
increasing
 

667
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,269
increasing
similarly if they are smaller if we are

668
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
similarly if they are smaller if we are
 

669
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,110
similarly if they are smaller if we are
looking for the third largest number but

670
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
looking for the third largest number but
 

671
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,990
looking for the third largest number but
there are only

672
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
there are only
 

673
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,110
there are only
two largest number in ugly meat then we

674
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
two largest number in ugly meat then we
 

675
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,910
two largest number in ugly meat then we
need to

676
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
need to
 

677
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,150
need to
reduce the meat now we set the

678
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
reduce the meat now we set the
 

679
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,189
reduce the meat now we set the
right hand right boundary meat minus one

680
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
right hand right boundary meat minus one
 

681
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,069
right hand right boundary meat minus one
so you keep the middle will be

682
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
so you keep the middle will be
 

683
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,949
so you keep the middle will be
meter will be in the lower half am right

684
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
meter will be in the lower half am right
 

685
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:45,829
meter will be in the lower half am right
yes

686
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
yes
 

687
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,550
yes
do you get it yes it's like a searching

688
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560
do you get it yes it's like a searching
 

689
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,110
do you get it yes it's like a searching
it's like

690
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
it's like
 

691
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,670
it's like
you make a guess from zero to a hundred

692
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
you make a guess from zero to a hundred
 

693
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,310
you make a guess from zero to a hundred
and then if i say fifty

694
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
and then if i say fifty
 

695
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,430
and then if i say fifty
if you get some number uh 50

696
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
if you get some number uh 50
 

697
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,749
if you get some number uh 50
like i said if it's a smaller than what

698
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759
like i said if it's a smaller than what
 

699
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,829
like i said if it's a smaller than what
i i thought you need to

700
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
i i thought you need to
 

701
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,790
i i thought you need to
consider searching between 50 to 100 i'm

702
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
consider searching between 50 to 100 i'm
 

703
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,189
consider searching between 50 to 100 i'm
right

704
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
right
 

705
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,110
right
yes and if i say it's bigger then you

706
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
yes and if i say it's bigger then you
 

707
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,430
yes and if i say it's bigger then you
need to search if between 0 to 50. i'm

708
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
need to search if between 0 to 50. i'm
 

709
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,230
need to search if between 0 to 50. i'm
right

710
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
right
 

711
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,590
right
yeah not 50 exactly 50 minus one and

712
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
yeah not 50 exactly 50 minus one and
 

713
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,790
yeah not 50 exactly 50 minus one and
in other cases it's 50 plus one do we

714
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
in other cases it's 50 plus one do we
 

715
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,590
in other cases it's 50 plus one do we
get it

716
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
get it
 

717
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,910
get it
yeah this experiment is very very

718
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
yeah this experiment is very very
 

719
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,430
yeah this experiment is very very
important okay

720
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
important okay
 

721
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,189
important okay
okay good job good job let's let's do

00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
okay so now you can turn on the lights
 

729
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,230
okay so now you can turn on the lights
and do some

730
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
and do some
 

731
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,829
and do some
dang things to other people in the world
