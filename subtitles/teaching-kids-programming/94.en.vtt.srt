00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,390

hello hello hello mr eric mr ryan how

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
hello hello hello mr eric mr ryan how
 

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,670
hello hello hello mr eric mr ryan how
are you today good

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,680
are you today good
 

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,870
are you today good
good okay so today we'll talk about

6
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:08,880
good okay so today we'll talk about
 

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,190
good okay so today we'll talk about
finding the max product so what's

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
finding the max product so what's
 

9
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,990
finding the max product so what's
product

10
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
product
 

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,549
product
of three numbers in an array so product

12
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
of three numbers in an array so product
 

13
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,710
of three numbers in an array so product
is times together multiply

14
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:16,720
is times together multiply
 

15
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,670
is times together multiply
so next product

16
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,680
so next product
 

17
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,870
so next product
of three numbers

18
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:24,880
of three numbers
 

19
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,669
of three numbers
in array okay so for example like

20
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
in array okay so for example like
 

21
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,910
in array okay so for example like
and the numbers could be negative for

22
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
and the numbers could be negative for
 

23
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,150
and the numbers could be negative for
example like minus one

24
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
example like minus one
 

25
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,229
example like minus one
two three five so

26
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
two three five so
 

27
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,030
two three five so
the next three numbers will be four

28
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
the next three numbers will be four
 

29
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,590
the next three numbers will be four
numbers

30
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
numbers
 

31
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,069
numbers
yeah i know but you choose three numbers

32
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
yeah i know but you choose three numbers
 

33
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,150
yeah i know but you choose three numbers
and then times it together

34
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
and then times it together
 

35
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,190
and then times it together
i want you to compute the max product

36
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
i want you to compute the max product
 

37
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,110
i want you to compute the max product
it is 30. yeah we're done 2.35 yes

38
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
it is 30. yeah we're done 2.35 yes
 

39
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,229
it is 30. yeah we're done 2.35 yes
okay so and remember it could be

40
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
okay so and remember it could be
 

41
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,110
okay so and remember it could be
negative so for example it will be

42
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
negative so for example it will be
 

43
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,229
negative so for example it will be
minus 200 minus

44
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
minus 200 minus
 

45
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,270
minus 200 minus
a hundred so what's the arizona

46
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
a hundred so what's the arizona
 

47
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,510
a hundred so what's the arizona
so you pick minus 200 minus 100

48
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
so you pick minus 200 minus 100
 

49
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,149
so you pick minus 200 minus 100
double negative makes positive so 200

50
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
double negative makes positive so 200
 

51
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,789
double negative makes positive so 200
times 100 times 5 that's the max product

52
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
times 100 times 5 that's the max product
 

53
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,990
times 100 times 5 that's the max product
got it yes any questions

54
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000

 

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,789

what can you use the same number twice

56
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
what can you use the same number twice
 

57
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,990
what can you use the same number twice
that's a good question no

58
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
that's a good question no
 

59
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,230
that's a good question no
we can't we you only pick one numbers

60
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
we can't we you only pick one numbers
 

61
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,710
we can't we you only pick one numbers
once okay so any thoughts and this

62
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
once okay so any thoughts and this
 

63
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,789
once okay so any thoughts and this
number these arrays

64
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
number these arrays
 

65
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,990
number these arrays
are not necessarily sorted you know

66
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
are not necessarily sorted you know
 

67
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,789
are not necessarily sorted you know
for now i just give it from from the

68
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
for now i just give it from from the
 

69
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,830
for now i just give it from from the
smallest to the

70
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
smallest to the
 

71
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,030
smallest to the
largest yeah so it's it's not necessary

72
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
largest yeah so it's it's not necessary
 

73
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,310
largest yeah so it's it's not necessary
sorry i will give you an

74
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
sorry i will give you an
 

75
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,429
sorry i will give you an
assorted list for example like 2

76
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
assorted list for example like 2
 

77
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,350
assorted list for example like 2
1 minus ten

78
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
1 minus ten
 

79
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,550
1 minus ten
three ten so what's the

80
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
three ten so what's the
 

81
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,389
three ten so what's the
next product

82
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399

 

83
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:02,730

uh

84
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:02,740
uh
 

85
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,109

[Music]

86
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119

 

87
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,070

fifty fifty how do you come up with

88
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
fifty fifty how do you come up with
 

89
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,029
fifty fifty how do you come up with
fifty

90
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
fifty
 

91
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,070
fifty
ten times three times two then that's

92
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
ten times three times two then that's
 

93
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,270
ten times three times two then that's
fifty that's sixty isn't it

94
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
fifty that's sixty isn't it
 

95
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,550
fifty that's sixty isn't it
oh yeah yeah

96
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
oh yeah yeah
 

97
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,030
oh yeah yeah
okay okay so any idea how we start

98
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
okay okay so any idea how we start
 

99
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,630
okay okay so any idea how we start
solving this problem

100
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
solving this problem
 

101
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,910
solving this problem
ryan any sauce so let's sort them out

102
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
ryan any sauce so let's sort them out
 

103
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,309
ryan any sauce so let's sort them out
we're done so first of all we saw this

104
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
we're done so first of all we saw this
 

105
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,670
we're done so first of all we saw this
array okay

106
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
array okay
 

107
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,190
array okay
we saw for example this is salted

108
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
we saw for example this is salted
 

109
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,869
we saw for example this is salted
alright so first of all

110
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
alright so first of all
 

111
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,710
alright so first of all
okay so that look define max

112
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
okay so that look define max
 

113
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,550
okay so that look define max
product okay

114
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560

 

115
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,470

okay so first of all we saw this number

116
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
okay so first of all we saw this number
 

117
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,950
okay so first of all we saw this number
so how do we solve it

118
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:51,960

 

119
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,589

[Music]

120
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599

 

121
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,790

okay so when you do this it's sorting

122
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
okay so when you do this it's sorting
 

123
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,470
okay so when you do this it's sorting
from the smallest to the

124
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
from the smallest to the
 

125
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,229
from the smallest to the
largest is ascending order okay so

126
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
largest is ascending order okay so
 

127
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,470
largest is ascending order okay so
if you want to sort it in the reverse

128
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
if you want to sort it in the reverse
 

129
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,910
if you want to sort it in the reverse
order for example it would be

130
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
order for example it would be
 

131
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,630
order for example it would be
five three two minus one minus and minus

132
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
five three two minus one minus and minus
 

133
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,910
five three two minus one minus and minus
two hundred you have to

134
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
two hundred you have to
 

135
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,190
two hundred you have to
put a thing here called reverse

136
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
put a thing here called reverse
 

137
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,790
put a thing here called reverse
reverse yeah us equals true

138
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
reverse yeah us equals true
 

139
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,869
reverse yeah us equals true
so if you put that thing in here then

140
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
so if you put that thing in here then
 

141
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,390
so if you put that thing in here then
you start it from the largest to the

142
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
you start it from the largest to the
 

143
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,350
you start it from the largest to the
smallest okay

144
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
smallest okay
 

145
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,589
smallest okay
so after salting in another salting we

146
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
so after salting in another salting we
 

147
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,430
so after salting in another salting we
talked about a quick saw the merch saw

148
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
talked about a quick saw the merch saw
 

149
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,910
talked about a quick saw the merch saw
yeah

150
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
yeah
 

151
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,070
yeah
you still remember yeah quick so almost

152
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
you still remember yeah quick so almost
 

153
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,670
you still remember yeah quick so almost
so yeah

154
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
so yeah
 

155
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,509
so yeah
what's the time complexity of this

156
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
what's the time complexity of this
 

157
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,789
what's the time complexity of this
sorting

158
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799

 

159
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,869

okay yeah we're done

160
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879

 

161
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,949

okay so once we sorted how do we find

162
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
okay so once we sorted how do we find
 

163
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,110
okay so once we sorted how do we find
out the next three products

164
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
out the next three products
 

165
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,670
out the next three products
we go from the last

166
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680

 

167
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,789

and then then go

168
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
and then then go
 

169
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,990
and then then go
back yeah twice okay so

170
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
back yeah twice okay so
 

171
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,589
back yeah twice okay so
you first of all you check these three

172
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
you first of all you check these three
 

173
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,670
you first of all you check these three
yeah yeah again

174
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
yeah yeah again
 

175
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,110
yeah yeah again
that's it how about you for this

176
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
that's it how about you for this
 

177
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,030
that's it how about you for this
negative look because it could be

178
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
negative look because it could be
 

179
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,030
negative look because it could be
negative yeah if they're too

180
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
negative yeah if they're too
 

181
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,070
negative yeah if they're too
negative yeah so basically you check

182
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
negative yeah so basically you check
 

183
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,789
negative yeah so basically you check
two yeah and you you check these two

184
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
two yeah and you you check these two
 

185
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,270
two yeah and you you check these two
plus

186
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
plus
 

187
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,830
plus
times this all right yeah so there are

188
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
times this all right yeah so there are
 

189
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,670
times this all right yeah so there are
only two possibilities yeah

190
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
only two possibilities yeah
 

191
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,670
only two possibilities yeah
could could it be choosing three numbers

192
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
could could it be choosing three numbers
 

193
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,270
could could it be choosing three numbers
here no

194
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
here no
 

195
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,350
here no
right because if you if you choose two

196
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
right because if you if you choose two
 

197
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,390
right because if you if you choose two
from the list

198
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
from the list
 

199
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,870
from the list
yeah the best case is these two are

200
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
yeah the best case is these two are
 

201
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,510
yeah the best case is these two are
negative

202
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
negative
 

203
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,150
negative
and then this is positive right but if

204
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
and then this is positive right but if
 

205
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,990
and then this is positive right but if
you could choose a positive why not

206
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
you could choose a positive why not
 

207
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,390
you could choose a positive why not
choose

208
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
choose
 

209
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,430
choose
these big largest positive

210
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
these big largest positive
 

211
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,270
these big largest positive
do you see the problem yes only so these

212
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
do you see the problem yes only so these
 

213
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,390
do you see the problem yes only so these
the maximum of these three numbers and

214
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
the maximum of these three numbers and
 

215
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,950
the maximum of these three numbers and
these two numbers and these is the

216
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
these two numbers and these is the
 

217
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,670
these two numbers and these is the
answer

218
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
answer
 

219
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,310
answer
yeah you could choose how about if i

220
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
yeah you could choose how about if i
 

221
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,030
yeah you could choose how about if i
choose one

222
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
choose one
 

223
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,270
choose one
what numbers here if i choose one number

224
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
what numbers here if i choose one number
 

225
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,110
what numbers here if i choose one number
this could be negative right

226
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
this could be negative right
 

227
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,670
this could be negative right
yes if it's negative then the result is

228
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
yes if it's negative then the result is
 

229
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,230
yes if it's negative then the result is
negative

230
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
negative
 

231
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,189
negative
obviously that's not not let's not do it

232
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
obviously that's not not let's not do it
 

233
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,550
obviously that's not not let's not do it
by a minute

234
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
by a minute
 

235
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,990
by a minute
okay okay okay so now let's find um

236
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
okay okay okay so now let's find um
 

237
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,430
okay okay okay so now let's find um
so how do we do this look let's

238
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
so how do we do this look let's
 

239
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,510
so how do we do this look let's
return yeah you just tell me return max

240
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
return yeah you just tell me return max
 

241
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,230
return yeah you just tell me return max
max what numbs

242
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
max what numbs
 

243
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,430
max what numbs
what's this minus one yeah yeah tons

244
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
what's this minus one yeah yeah tons
 

245
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,850
what's this minus one yeah yeah tons
what's this

246
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:27,860

 

247
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:37,029

248
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039

 

249
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,510

what was this i'm going to compare with

250
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
what was this i'm going to compare with
 

251
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,570
what was this i'm going to compare with
space so

252
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:43,580

 

253

[Music]
yellow yeah times what's this

256
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
yellow yeah times what's this
 

257
00:05:49,120 --> 00:06:04,710
yellow yeah times what's this
noun is what

258
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720

 

259
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,830

minus one okay so so look

260
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
minus one okay so so look
 

261
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,189
minus one okay so so look
do you understand what's the complexity

262
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199

 

263
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,270

yeah we're done because this is constant

264
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
yeah we're done because this is constant
 

265
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,629
yeah we're done because this is constant
yeah this is constant and

266
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
yeah this is constant and
 

267
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,710
yeah this is constant and
it's this whole thing is dominated by

268
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
it's this whole thing is dominated by
 

269
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,150
it's this whole thing is dominated by
this uh

270
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
this uh
 

271
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,710
this uh
sorting aggregate so one more time okay

272
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
sorting aggregate so one more time okay
 

273
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,790
sorting aggregate so one more time okay
so the maximum three products could be

274
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
so the maximum three products could be
 

275
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,749
so the maximum three products could be
only

276
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
only
 

277
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,670
only
if it is negative because we're sorting

278
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
if it is negative because we're sorting
 

279
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,870
if it is negative because we're sorting
the array

280
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
the array
 

281
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,029
the array
then that you'll be from the negative

282
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
then that you'll be from the negative
 

283
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,029
then that you'll be from the negative
possibly to the largest after the

284
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
possibly to the largest after the
 

285
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,550
possibly to the largest after the
positive so the

286
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
positive so the
 

287
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,670
positive so the
the next three product could be the

288
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
the next three product could be the
 

289
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,550
the next three product could be the
biggest three numbers yeah or the

290
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
biggest three numbers yeah or the
 

291
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,309
biggest three numbers yeah or the
smallest two numbers because

292
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
smallest two numbers because
 

293
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,309
smallest two numbers because
they may carry the negative sign and

294
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
they may carry the negative sign and
 

295
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,469
they may carry the negative sign and
when it comes together the negative

296
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
when it comes together the negative
 

297
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,510
when it comes together the negative
will become positive yeah but uh because

298
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
will become positive yeah but uh because
 

299
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,110
will become positive yeah but uh because
there's three numbers so we need one

300
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
there's three numbers so we need one
 

301
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,550
there's three numbers so we need one
more number so what

302
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
more number so what
 

303
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,270
more number so what
if these two numbers make positive and i

304
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
if these two numbers make positive and i
 

305
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,790
if these two numbers make positive and i
need one more number i

306
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
need one more number i
 

307
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,710
need one more number i
i could better choose the largest one

308
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
i could better choose the largest one
 

309
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,150
i could better choose the largest one
yeah which is this side

310
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
yeah which is this side
 

311
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,390
yeah which is this side
all right yeah because i choose this

312
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
all right yeah because i choose this
 

313
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,309
all right yeah because i choose this
list obviously not optimal i can choose

314
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
list obviously not optimal i can choose
 

315
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:04,629
list obviously not optimal i can choose
this

316
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
this
 

317
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,150
this
yes got it okay so that's it bye

318
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
yes got it okay so that's it bye
 

319
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,790
yes got it okay so that's it bye
bye bye bye

320
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:11,800
