hello hello mr eric uh
today we talk about binary trees so

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,680
today we talk about binary trees so
 

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,190
today we talk about binary trees so
what's binary trees

6
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
what's binary trees
 

7
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,270
what's binary trees
i'm good yeah you're a very good

8
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
i'm good yeah you're a very good

apprenticeship what's minority
 

11
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,830
apprenticeship what's minority
is a upside down tree with numbers okay

12
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:13,840
is a upside down tree with numbers okay
 

13
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,629
is a upside down tree with numbers okay
so can you

14
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:14,639
so can you
 

15
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,990
so can you
write a tree please any binary tree

16
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
write a tree please any binary tree
 

17
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:34,069
write a tree please any binary tree
yes yes

18
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079

 

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,750

00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
it only has one
 

31
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,069
it only has one
root right which nose has the

32
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
root right which nose has the
 

33
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,430
root right which nose has the
zero parent uh root

what's in order in order

40
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
what's in order in order
 

41
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,030
what's in order in order
let's talk about pre-order first what's

42
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
let's talk about pre-order first what's
 

43
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,870
let's talk about pre-order first what's
pre-order

44
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
pre-order
 

45
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,710
pre-order
pre-order and then there's in order

46
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
pre-order and then there's in order
 

47
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,030
pre-order and then there's in order
and then that's the post order these are

48
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
and then that's the post order these are
 

49
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,710
and then that's the post order these are
three ways of travel

50
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
three ways of travel
 

51
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,870
three ways of travel
i think it and there's the best resource

52
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
i think it and there's the best resource
 

53
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,390
i think it and there's the best resource
yeah

54
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
yeah
 

55
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,450
yeah
which one is the default search

56
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:26,460
which one is the default search
 

57
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,630
which one is the default search
[Music]

58
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
[Music]
 

59
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,990
[Music]
which one is the death switch i think

60
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
which one is the death switch i think
 

61
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,910
which one is the death switch i think
blue dude root left right yeah

62
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
blue dude root left right yeah
 

63
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,950
blue dude root left right yeah
so this is nude left blue the left

64
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
so this is nude left blue the left
 

65
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,630
so this is nude left blue the left
right uh so no the left to right okay

66
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
right uh so no the left to right okay
 

67
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,230
right uh so no the left to right okay
note left to right okay and breakfast

68
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
note left to right okay and breakfast
 

69
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,190
note left to right okay and breakfast
is level by level right and in order is

70
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
is level by level right and in order is
 

71
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,310
is level by level right and in order is
what

72
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
what
 

73
00:01:50,320 --> 00:02:01,749
what
uh

74
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759

 

75
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,870

right left

76
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
right left
 

77
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,229
right left
left right no

78
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
left right no
 

79
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,510
left right no
look post you just this is in the middle

80
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
look post you just this is in the middle
 

81
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:11,990
look post you just this is in the middle
these

82
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
these
 

83
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,510
these
is in the previous the first this is

84
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
is in the previous the first this is
 

85
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,510
is in the previous the first this is
in the last right that's what they

86
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
in the last right that's what they
 

87
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,510
in the last right that's what they
called breakfast so which one is the

88
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
called breakfast so which one is the
 

89
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,869
called breakfast so which one is the
default search

90
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879

 

91
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,710

okay so that's good um so we are given

92
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
okay so that's good um so we are given
 

93
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,309
okay so that's good um so we are given
we are given a pre-order and

94
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
we are given a pre-order and
 

95
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,990
we are given a pre-order and
uh in order and we can determine

96
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
uh in order and we can determine
 

97
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,670
uh in order and we can determine
a binary tree right yeah so let's do an

98
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
a binary tree right yeah so let's do an
 

99
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,470
a binary tree right yeah so let's do an
example

100
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480

 

101
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,550

uh four zero

102
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
uh four zero
 

103
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,470
uh four zero
uh forward four two one zero three okay

104
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
uh forward four two one zero three okay
 

105
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,990
uh forward four two one zero three okay
four two one

106
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
four two one
 

107
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,190
four two one
zero three so can you really

108
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
zero three so can you really
 

109
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,509
zero three so can you really
on balance i'm balanced yes i went down

110
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
on balance i'm balanced yes i went down
 

111
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,430
on balance i'm balanced yes i went down
so what's balance what's unbalance

112
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
so what's balance what's unbalance
 

113
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,550
so what's balance what's unbalance
what's balance a balanced one

114
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
what's balance a balanced one
 

115
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,630
what's balance a balanced one
is like a flu vibration

116
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
is like a flu vibration
 

117
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,550
is like a flu vibration
normally the violence is like the

118
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
normally the violence is like the
 

119
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,990
normally the violence is like the
difference the maximum difference

120
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
difference the maximum difference
 

121
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,830
difference the maximum difference
between any left and the left and

122
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
between any left and the left and
 

123
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,550
between any left and the left and
right is smaller than or equal than one

124
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
right is smaller than or equal than one
 

125
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,430
right is smaller than or equal than one
right

126
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
right
 

127
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,430
right
so look this is definitely not right

128
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
so look this is definitely not right
 

129
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,630
so look this is definitely not right
because look

130
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640

 

131
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,869

this is a lot right it's not balanced

132
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
this is a lot right it's not balanced
 

133
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,070
this is a lot right it's not balanced
yeah

134
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
yeah
 

135
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,789
yeah
okay so what's the pre-order of these

136
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
okay so what's the pre-order of these
 

137
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,990
okay so what's the pre-order of these
what's the pre-order

138
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
what's the pre-order
 

139
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,470
what's the pre-order
pre-order of these can you give me an

140
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
pre-order of these can you give me an
 

141
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,430
pre-order of these can you give me an
example

142
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440

 

143
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,789

okay so it is four two one

144
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
okay so it is four two one
 

145
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,509
okay so it is four two one
zero three we're done four two one zero

146
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
zero three we're done four two one zero
 

147
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,550
zero three we're done four two one zero
three okay four

148
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
three okay four
 

149
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,910
three okay four
two one zero and what's the in order

150
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
two one zero and what's the in order
 

151
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,030
two one zero and what's the in order
uh two one zero three four

152
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
uh two one zero three four
 

153
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,470
uh two one zero three four
two one zero three four okay so now

154
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
two one zero three four okay so now
 

155
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,830
two one zero three four okay so now
given this final three you can calculate

156
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
given this final three you can calculate
 

157
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,589
given this final three you can calculate
you can you know we know let's

158
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
you can you know we know let's
 

159
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,750
you can you know we know let's
pre-order in order how about we don't

160
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
pre-order in order how about we don't
 

161
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,949
pre-order in order how about we don't
know this binary

162
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
know this binary
 

163
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,830
know this binary
but given these what's the stress is to

164
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
but given these what's the stress is to
 

165
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,149
but given these what's the stress is to
be at least from these two right

166
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
be at least from these two right
 

167
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,589
be at least from these two right
yeah this is thinking backwards right

168
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
yeah this is thinking backwards right
 

169

and then this in order is what in order
it's

192
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
it's
 

193
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,189
it's
a l and i right so this

194
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
a l and i right so this
 

195
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,390
a l and i right so this
is given right this is given right so we

196
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
is given right this is given right so we
 

197
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,270
is given right this is given right so we
need to find

198
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
need to find
 

199
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,230
need to find
this in the n in the second which is

200
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
this in the n in the second which is
 

201
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,430
this in the n in the second which is
yeah

202
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
yeah
 

203
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,430
yeah
and then we know this we find it here so

204
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
and then we know this we find it here so
 

205
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,110
and then we know this we find it here so
we know this bit

206
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
we know this bit
 

207
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,749
we know this bit
which means that no right yeah this is

208
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
which means that no right yeah this is
 

209
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,150
which means that no right yeah this is
left

210
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
left
 

211
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,790
left
and then this is right right yeah does

212
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
and then this is right right yeah does
 

213
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,590
and then this is right right yeah does
it make sense

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
it make sense
 

215
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,950
it make sense
yeah so in this case we can't

216
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
yeah so in this case we can't
 

217
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,430
yeah so in this case we can't
yeah i know we can but in some cases

218
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
yeah i know we can but in some cases
 

219
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,550
yeah i know we can but in some cases
they are right right

220
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
they are right right
 

221
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,670
they are right right
but here we find it and then what should

222
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
but here we find it and then what should
 

223
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,790
but here we find it and then what should
we

224
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
we
 

225
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,029
we

okay so let's see
 

233
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,990
okay so let's see
okay let's see this nine okay so four

234
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
okay let's see this nine okay so four
 

235
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,029
okay let's see this nine okay so four
two one zero three nine right

two one so look um
 

271
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,270
two one so look um
so let's pre-order pre-order 2103

272
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
so let's pre-order pre-order 2103
 

273
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,950
so let's pre-order pre-order 2103
it's on the left so the left is

274
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
it's on the left so the left is
 

275
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,469
it's on the left so the left is
again two right yeah yeah

276
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
again two right yeah yeah
 

277
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,309
again two right yeah yeah
and then 2103 because we know 2 103 is

278
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
and then 2103 because we know 2 103 is
 

279
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,110
and then 2103 because we know 2 103 is
on the left so this is 2 103

280
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
on the left so this is 2 103
 

281
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,870
on the left so this is 2 103
and then that's 9. so look 2 is on the

282
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
and then that's 9. so look 2 is on the
 

283
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,510
and then that's 9. so look 2 is on the
left 2 103 and 9 will be on the right

284
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
left 2 103 and 9 will be on the right
 

285
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,550
left 2 103 and 9 will be on the right
right

286
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
right
 

287
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,590
right
and 2 103 again i take it out and then

288
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
and 2 103 again i take it out and then
 

289
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,909
and 2 103 again i take it out and then
you'll pick one 103 right

290
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
you'll pick one 103 right
 

291
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,270
you'll pick one 103 right
one or three

292
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280

 

293
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,230

so um so we can do this recursively

294
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
so um so we can do this recursively
 

295
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,589
so um so we can do this recursively
right

296
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
right
 

297
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,230
right
because two and i find a two here in a

298
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
because two and i find a two here in a
 

299
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,469
because two and i find a two here in a
two here so there is no left

300
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
two here so there is no left
 

301
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,950
two here so there is no left
all these are right right doesn't make

302
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
all these are right right doesn't make
 

303
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,629
all these are right right doesn't make
sense yeah

304
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
sense yeah
 

305
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,150
sense yeah
okay so let's do this

306
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,160
okay so let's do this
 

307
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,189
okay so let's do this
let's do this define

308
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
let's do this define
 

309
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,510
let's do this define
beard here

uh let's totally pre-order
 

313
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,469
uh let's totally pre-order
and that's in order oh yeah no yeah no

314
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
and that's in order oh yeah no yeah no

let's say if in order okay if if not in
order okay

322
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
order okay
 

323
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,309
order okay
if we are using using all the elements

324
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
if we are using using all the elements
 

325
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:36,870
if we are using using all the elements
in the

326
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
in the

list in not in order right or not
 

329
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,029
list in not in order right or not
preorder is the same

330
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
preorder is the same
 

331
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,230
preorder is the same
with return we return just return long

332
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
with return we return just return long
 

333
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,510
with return we return just return long
what okay yeah yeah because we it's

334
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
what okay yeah yeah because we it's
 

335
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,670
what okay yeah yeah because we it's
empty list we just return it right

336
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
empty list we just return it right
 

337
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,790
empty list we just return it right
so now we need to find a try

338
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
so now we need to find a try
 

339
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,950
so now we need to find a try
find the root do the let's say the value

340
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
find the root do the let's say the value
 

341
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,830
find the root do the let's say the value
is i okay i

342
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
is i okay i
 

343
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,950
is i okay i
equals preorder

344
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
equals preorder
 

345
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,869
equals preorder
which which element in the pre-order is

346
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
which which element in the pre-order is
 

347
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,309
which which element in the pre-order is
the current load

348
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
the current load
 

349
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,909
the current load
which anime in the pre-order is the

350
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
which anime in the pre-order is the
 

351
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,909
which anime in the pre-order is the
current root the first one

352
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
current root the first one
 

353
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,189
current root the first one
the first one yes so how do we popular

354
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
the first one yes so how do we popular
 

355
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,430
the first one yes so how do we popular
how do we use how to remove the first

356
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
how do we use how to remove the first
 

357
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,309
how do we use how to remove the first
element from the

358
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
element from the
 

359
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,749

pork which which one pops yellow is the
 

369
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,309
pork which which one pops yellow is the
first one if we don't

370
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
first one if we don't
 

371
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,149
first one if we don't
supply this zero what does it do it

372
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
supply this zero what does it do it

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,589
pops pops which animal
which is the other direction of us lost

376
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
which is the other direction of us lost
 

377
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,750
which is the other direction of us lost
yes we're done if we don't specify this

378
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
yes we're done if we don't specify this

zero you'll be the last one
 

381
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,990
zero you'll be the last one
so leave home what's the temperature

382
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
so leave home what's the temperature
 

383
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,750
so leave home what's the temperature
what's the time complexity of this pop

384
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
what's the time complexity of this pop
 

385
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,190
what's the time complexity of this pop
zero

386
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
zero
 

387
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,509
zero
oh and yeah but if we are using double

388
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
oh and yeah but if we are using double
 

389
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,030
oh and yeah but if we are using double
nbq it will be

390
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
nbq it will be
 

391
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,790
nbq it will be
you'll be pop left and which will be

392
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
you'll be pop left and which will be
 

393
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,710
you'll be pop left and which will be
constant right yes

394
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
constant right yes
 

395
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,070
constant right yes
okay so now we have this blue and then

396
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
okay so now we have this blue and then
 

397
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,190
okay so now we have this blue and then
uh

398
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
uh
 

399
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,389
uh
the left so let's say dude okay equals

400
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
the left so let's say dude okay equals
 

401
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,350
the left so let's say dude okay equals
three okay okay sorry about my alarm

402
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360

 

403
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,030

so so order equals

404
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
so so order equals
 

405
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,590
so so order equals
three and then we're given this i right

406
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
three and then we're given this i right
 

407
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,190
three and then we're given this i right
this is the load right

408
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
this is the load right
 

409
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,269
this is the load right
so now we need to build the left tree

410
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
so now we need to build the left tree
 

411
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,150
so now we need to build the left tree
and appear the right tree yeah right

412
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
and appear the right tree yeah right
 

413
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,870
and appear the right tree yeah right
yeah

414
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
yeah
 

415
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,670
yeah
and then we just need to return what

416
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
and then we just need to return what
 

417
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,910
and then we just need to return what
return here

418
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
return here
 

419
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,430
return here
i'll be on the loot i'll be on the left

420
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
i'll be on the loot i'll be on the left
 

421
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,949
i'll be on the loot i'll be on the left
tree i feel the right tree i need to

422
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
tree i feel the right tree i need to
 

423
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:37,750
tree i feel the right tree i need to
build the one

424
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
build the one
 

425
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,230
build the one
return what victory return route okay

426
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
return what victory return route okay
 

427
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,550
return what victory return route okay
so the thing is how do we feel this so

428
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
so the thing is how do we feel this so
 

429
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,310
so the thing is how do we feel this so
we need a beer

430
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
we need a beer
 

431
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,310
we need a beer
right the preorder we already taken one

432
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
right the preorder we already taken one
 

433
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,389
right the preorder we already taken one
element out so the first element is

434
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
element out so the first element is
 

435
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,030
element out so the first element is
uh pre-order right and this is the same

436
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
uh pre-order right and this is the same
 

437
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,829
uh pre-order right and this is the same
yeah because

438
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
yeah because
 

439
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,590
yeah because
we already taken the first element now

440
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
we already taken the first element now
 

441
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,829
we already taken the first element now
right yeah yeah so that would be

442
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
right yeah yeah so that would be
 

443
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,070
right yeah yeah so that would be
because we it's always the first element

444
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
because we it's always the first element
 

445
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,870
because we it's always the first element
right

446
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
right
 

447
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,150
right
that's the root right so now now that

448
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
that's the root right so now now that
 

449
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,910
that's the root right so now now that
the the thing is we need to find it in

450
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
the the thing is we need to find it in
 

451
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,750
the the thing is we need to find it in
uh the in order in order thing okay so

right but we need to find it then uh

494
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
right but we need to find it then uh
 

495
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,870
right but we need to find it then uh
let's let's let's do it in let's see how

496
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
let's let's let's do it in let's see how
 

497
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,710
let's let's let's do it in let's see how
do we find it is you can do this in

498
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
do we find it is you can do this in
 

499
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,150
do we find it is you can do this in
order

500
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
order
 

501
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,350
order
you know the dot index right

502
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
you know the dot index right
 

503
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,069
you know the dot index right
index you will find this in that right

504
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
index you will find this in that right
 

505
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:14,389
index you will find this in that right
this

506
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
this
 

507
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,509
this
is i will be index but now the tree i

508
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
is i will be index but now the tree i
 

509
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,509
is i will be index but now the tree i
will be

510
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
will be
 

511
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,829
will be
you can say is you will be pre-ordered

512
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
you can say is you will be pre-ordered
 

513
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,949
you can say is you will be pre-ordered
the

514
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
the
 

515
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,030
the
because it's already top it so i can say

516
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
because it's already top it so i can say
 

517
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,710
because it's already top it so i can say
in order i right

518
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
in order i right
 

519
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,069
in order i right
it's the same okay right look

520
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
it's the same okay right look
 

521
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,389
it's the same okay right look
the reason i want to find this index uh

522
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
the reason i want to find this index uh
 

523
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,509
the reason i want to find this index uh
i slightly write it

524
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
i slightly write it
 

525
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,590
i slightly write it
because i need to find this index right

526
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
because i need to find this index right
 

527
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,949
because i need to find this index right
look maybe

528
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
look maybe
 

529
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,750
look maybe
in order to order the top zero i take

530
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:39,760
in order to order the top zero i take
 

531
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,829
in order to order the top zero i take
the first element out of this

532
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
the first element out of this
 

533
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,910
the first element out of this
which is one and i find it in the second

534
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
which is one and i find it in the second
 

535
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,350
which is one and i find it in the second
one which is there

536
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
one which is there
 

537
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,990
one which is there
which is this position yeah and then in

538
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
which is this position yeah and then in
 

539
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,350
which is this position yeah and then in
order i will be the loo

540
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
order i will be the loo
 

541
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,750
order i will be the loo
it's the same yeah i i equal one and

542
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
it's the same yeah i i equal one and
 

543
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,509
it's the same yeah i i equal one and
then now and now

544
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
then now and now
 

545
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,790
then now and now
everything up to list will be the left

546
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
everything up to list will be the left
 

547
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,910
everything up to list will be the left
everything after will be right right so

548
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
everything after will be right right so
 

549
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,350
everything after will be right right so
these here so that would be

550
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
these here so that would be
 

551
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,030
these here so that would be
in order everything

552
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
in order everything
 

553
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,949
in order everything
up to i but not including the load right

554
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
up to i but not including the load right
 

555
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,870
up to i but not including the load right
yeah and then here what do i do here

556
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
yeah and then here what do i do here
 

557
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,710
yeah and then here what do i do here
in order the right three what what

558
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
in order the right three what what
 

559
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,790
in order the right three what what
should i do what do i do can you write

560
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
should i do what do i do can you write
 

561
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,990
should i do what do i do can you write
it here

562
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
it here
 

563
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,069
it here
after i so what

564
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
after i so what
 

565
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,190
after i so what
i plus one column right because

566
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
i plus one column right because
 

567
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,310
i plus one column right because
this i is the root right yeah

568
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
this i is the root right yeah
 

569
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,190
this i is the root right yeah
up to i eric this is this format from

570
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
up to i eric this is this format from
 

571
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,590
up to i eric this is this format from
two not including two right

572
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
two not including two right
 

573
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,710
two not including two right
so up to loot not including that's fine

574
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
so up to loot not including that's fine
 

575
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,350
so up to loot not including that's fine
but here

576
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
but here
 

577
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,269
but here
is wrong will be inclusive so i would

578
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
is wrong will be inclusive so i would
 

579
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,629
is wrong will be inclusive so i would
need to be

580
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
need to be
 

581
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,150
need to be
i plus one here right does it make sense

582
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
i plus one here right does it make sense
 

583
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,980
i plus one here right does it make sense
yeah what's the term complexity

584
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:48,990
yeah what's the term complexity
 

585
00:12:48,990 --> 00:13:00,790
yeah what's the term complexity
[Music]

586
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800

 

587
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,790

yeah this is every time look every time

588
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,800
yeah this is every time look every time
 

589
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,230
yeah this is every time look every time
i would need to

590
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
i would need to
 

591
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,629
i would need to
pop one from the beginning and then i

592
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
pop one from the beginning and then i
 

593
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,310
pop one from the beginning and then i
need to search it

594
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
need to search it
 

595
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,230
need to search it
for the second one right i need to

596
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
for the second one right i need to
 

597
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,590
for the second one right i need to
search it these will take

598
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
search it these will take
 

599
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,790
search it these will take
all n right what happens if uh this

600
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
all n right what happens if uh this
 

601
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,069
all n right what happens if uh this
this uh the range was one and there was

602
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
this uh the range was one and there was
 

603
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,790
this uh the range was one and there was
two ones okay that's a good question but

604
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
two ones okay that's a good question but
 

605
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,190
two ones okay that's a good question but
we are assuming that pre-order and in

606
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
we are assuming that pre-order and in
 

607
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,030
we are assuming that pre-order and in
order is both correct to

608
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
order is both correct to
 

609
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,230
order is both correct to
uniquely di identify a binary tree okay

610
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,240
uniquely di identify a binary tree okay
 

611
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,509
uniquely di identify a binary tree okay
so if you so so there is no such case

612
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519
so if you so so there is no such case
 

613
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,750
so if you so so there is no such case
when there are duplicate numbers right

614
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
when there are duplicate numbers right
 

615
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,069
when there are duplicate numbers right
yeah because look we need to index this

616
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
yeah because look we need to index this
 

617
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,150
yeah because look we need to index this
is finding an element in the list this

618
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
is finding an element in the list this
 

619
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,550
is finding an element in the list this
is our

620
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
is our
 

621
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,710
is our
n time but how many times we need to

622
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
n time but how many times we need to
 

623
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,230
n time but how many times we need to
potentially look for these

624
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
potentially look for these
 

625
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,949
potentially look for these
n n times so the complexities o n

626
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
n n times so the complexities o n
 

627
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,389
n n times so the complexities o n
squared doesn't make sense because they

628
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
squared doesn't make sense because they
 

629
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,430
squared doesn't make sense because they
are n loops yeah

630
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
are n loops yeah
 

631
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,829
are n loops yeah
they have to be unique yes yeah for

632
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
they have to be unique yes yeah for
 

633
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,590
they have to be unique yes yeah for
example if a level 3

634
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
example if a level 3
 

635
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,629
example if a level 3
is like that yeah always the

636
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
is like that yeah always the
 

637
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,069
is like that yeah always the
uh always please which is definitely

638
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
uh always please which is definitely
 

639
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,389
uh always please which is definitely
a balance i'm balanced yes and then you

640
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
a balance i'm balanced yes and then you
 

641
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,790
a balance i'm balanced yes and then you
need to look for these every time

642
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
need to look for these every time
 

643
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,230
need to look for these every time
the root yeah doesn't make sense

644
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
the root yeah doesn't make sense
 

645
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,949
the root yeah doesn't make sense
yes so you take om time and each one you

646
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
yes so you take om time and each one you
 

647
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,470
yes so you take om time and each one you
need to take a search for n

648
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
need to take a search for n
 

649
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,189
need to take a search for n
so look please pre-order doctor we can

650
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
so look please pre-order doctor we can
 

651
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:15,990
so look please pre-order doctor we can
do this

652
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
do this
 

653
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,509
do this
so look we can we can write this here

654
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
so look we can we can write this here
 

655
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,790
so look we can we can write this here
look look we can say uh

656
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
look look we can say uh
 

657
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,590
look look we can say uh
root of value blue value equals

658
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
root of value blue value equals
 

659
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,509
root of value blue value equals
pre-order the first one yeah

660
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
pre-order the first one yeah
 

661
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,350
pre-order the first one yeah
pre-order for the zero

662
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
pre-order for the zero
 

663
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,389
pre-order for the zero
right we're gonna know the value and

664
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
right we're gonna know the value and
 

665
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,430
right we're gonna know the value and
then

666
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
then
 

667
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,430
then
i will be in order

668
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
i will be in order
 

669
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,750
i will be in order
we know the top index

670
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
we know the top index
 

671
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,470
we know the top index
load of low value yeah this is the same

672
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
load of low value yeah this is the same
 

673
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,189
load of low value yeah this is the same
but we need to

674
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
but we need to
 

675
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,590
but we need to
get rid of the first one so we can we

676
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
get rid of the first one so we can we
 

677
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,870
get rid of the first one so we can we
can do this

678
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
can do this
 

679
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,189
can do this
we can we can do this we preorder then

680
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
we can we can do this we preorder then
 

681
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,389
we can we can do this we preorder then
we do this one

682
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399
we do this one
 

683
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,509
we do this one
dash yeah one dash

684
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
dash yeah one dash
 

685
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,790
dash yeah one dash
this is the same thing so means i i will

686
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
this is the same thing so means i i will
 

687
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,110
this is the same thing so means i i will
this this would uh discard the first

688
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
this this would uh discard the first
 

689
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,870
this this would uh discard the first
element i will use the second element

690
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
element i will use the second element
 

691
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,509
element i will use the second element
right

692
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
right
 

693
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,829
right
this is exactly the same as the pop zero

694
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:07,839
this is exactly the same as the pop zero
 

695
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,949
this is exactly the same as the pop zero
right yeah

696
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
right yeah
 

697
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,790
right yeah
so this is much clearer right root of

698
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
so this is much clearer right root of
 

699
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,269
so this is much clearer right root of
value will be preorder.0 the first

700
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
value will be preorder.0 the first
 

701
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,310
value will be preorder.0 the first
element right

702
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
element right
 

703
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,030
element right
and i search this root of value low

704
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
and i search this root of value low
 

705
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,590
and i search this root of value low
value

706
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
value
 

707
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,110
value
in in order right yeah

708
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
in in order right yeah
 

709
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,790
in in order right yeah
i don't want like because it appeared it

710
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:22,800
i don't want like because it appeared it
 

711
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,030
i don't want like because it appeared it
because i already know the first element

712
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
because i already know the first element
 

713
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,310
because i already know the first element
is the root of the current node current

714
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
is the root of the current node current
 

715
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,790
is the root of the current node current
3

716
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
3
 

717
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,590
3
so i will when i recursively built it i

718
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
so i will when i recursively built it i
 

719
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,189
so i will when i recursively built it i
will pop 0 i i will

720
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:33,199
will pop 0 i i will
 

721
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,749
will pop 0 i i will
disregard that discard the first one

722
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:35,759
disregard that discard the first one
 

723
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,749
disregard that discard the first one
yeah it's the same as purple 0.

724
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
yeah it's the same as purple 0.
 

725
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,949
yeah it's the same as purple 0.
does it make sense okay so let's

726
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
does it make sense okay so let's
 

727
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,629
does it make sense okay so let's
let me let me quickly

728
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639

 

729
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,749

no no no okay okay okay okay okay

huh in order

734
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
huh in order
 

735
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,509
huh in order
in order what's the key word to look for

736
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
in order what's the key word to look for
 

737
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,629
in order what's the key word to look for
the element

738
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
the element
 

739
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,790
the element
index yes index which index index one

740
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
index yes index which index index one
 

741
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,749
index yes index which index index one
pre-order index which one we want to

742
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
pre-order index which one we want to
 

743
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,550
pre-order index which one we want to
index the

744
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
index the
 

745
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,949
index the
we want to find the which element in the

746
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
we want to find the which element in the
 

747
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,629
we want to find the which element in the
in order

748
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
in order
 

749
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,949
in order
good loot and low value yeah let's see

750
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
good loot and low value yeah let's see
 

751
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:23,040
good loot and low value yeah let's see
okay we are done today bye bye bye
