1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
[Music]

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,320
we have talked about divide and conquer

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,679
yesterday right divide and conquer so

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,160
uh we have a big problem and then we

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,800
divide it into smaller chunks of work

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,840
and we can distribute them yeah

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,119
to solve them individually independently

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,240
and

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,160
remember

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,519
remember we have a few numbers yeah a

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,880
few numbers we're dividing the two

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,119
halves and then we

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,960
we check we get the maximum of the first

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,440
half and the maximum the second half

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,559
yeah and then we can merge them right

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,440
this is the same idea as the merge sort

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,200
yeah

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,600
so one advantage of this divide and

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,160
conquer is that we can do this

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,079
small task in parallel so in parallel

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,680
what's parallel so i have a task i can

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,000
do this in parallel

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,840
in parallel yeah i can do this tag i

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,800
have a task i can do this in parallel

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,520
layer

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,840
and then when this task the results for

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,719
these tasks completed i can merge it to

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,719
a big

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,960
uh you know merge it to get this the

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,920
solution for the entire big problem

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,439
right

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,479
so

33
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,479
if we parallelize this we can achieve

34
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,159
this performance speed up right

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,280
performance data you know the computers

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,840
have calls core they have cpu cpu

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,799
central process unit processing unit is

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,200
the brand of computer yeah brand

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,400
community they have 24 brands yeah my

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,439
computer have 24 cores 24 course 24

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,680
course cpu course yeah so each course is

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,000
like a brain okay when

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,560
so look if a task can be done in

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,720
parallel right for example if if it's

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,560
fully paralyzed but let's say there are

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,560
10 tasks 10 tasks

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,520
if i have only one brand yeah one core

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,920
cpu to do it it takes

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,240
it for example if it takes one minute to

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,320
complete one task then it needs 10

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,799
minutes to complete all these ten tasks

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,880
right but if i have a two cores

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,200
two cars two computers and these can be

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,600
taken in beta and how many minutes there

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,079
must be two people okay two people two

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,079
coins two cars is the same yeah so how

57
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,079
many

58
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,280
[Music]

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,400
okay this is the same assumption okay so

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,480
okay if you we if we were the one people

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,000
finished five coins another people

62
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,319
finished five five tasks

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,560
you know five tasks

64
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,560
uh so how long does it take

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,040
it takes four minutes five minutes yeah

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,440
exactly so look if i have this do this

67
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,480
in parallel so i can do this

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,959
five

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,200
yeah two brands two cars whatever yeah

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,440
and these are tasks or coins you pick

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,840
whatever the time

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,000
yeah one minute two minutes three

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,519
minutes four minutes five minutes right

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,360
because look the time is shortened

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,599
because these can be done in parallel

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,920
means that once one minute passed and

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,400
these can be done in parallel that's one

78
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,959
obvious way yeah one one quickest way is

79
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,360
to speed up yeah to get this performance

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,680
speed up right it's easier right so look

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,400
if a task is uh you know

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,599
if if we if we have a lot of tasks to

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,879
complete

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,120
and one easy way to make it faster

85
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
is to get more calls coming to help

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
right

87
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,080
right all right yes make sense

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,280
okay so look

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,360
it

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,040
now we introduced this concept called

91
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,040
the speed up okay what's with that

92
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,680
speed up

93
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,920
speedo is defined as the time of one

94
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,519
people one call

95
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,319
to uh finish the task divided by the

96
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,760
time of n calls or n people to have

97
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,280
divided class yeah so let's

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,440
is equal to 10 divided by five

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,680
exactly look if there are one people is

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,640
ten right if two people is five then the

101
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,920
speed up is two what easy and if ten

102
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,439
people this is

103
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,040
ten people that will be

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,040
one and speed up will be ten right

105
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,760
so let's speed up so

106
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,000
for this 100 if this class is a hundred

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,200
percent parallelizable minimum you know

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,920
you can just

109
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,599
you can this this work you can just

110
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,079
distribute it in parallel let's call

111
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,320
paralyzed but yeah and then the maximum

112
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,639
speed up is linear yeah given these n

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,360
chords you can achieve the speed up of n

114
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,080
i

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
that's linear yeah

116
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,600
that's the

117
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,240
number of core number of people number

118
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,360
of course let's speed up yeah and then

119
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,440
you can achieve this this new nino right

120
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,560
this is nina

121
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,320
but in

122
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,360
real life

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,600
in real life the the the task

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
compose sequential path and the

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,919
parallelized power what's the sequential

126
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,520
part if if i have a task

127
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,440
if i have a task look

128
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,960
i have tasks

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,960
look at these other tasks 10

130
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,440
and if i say okay these five

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,080
you can't distribute them in parallel

132
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,000
meaning that you can't have more course

133
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,000
helping to improve these you know

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,880
meaning these five needs to be taken

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,360
sequentially but these five you can ask

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,759
more course or people to come to help

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,520
right let's say five people five people

138
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,400
to help and you know

139
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,720
six

140
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,039
wow you quick look because this

141
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,440
needs to fight like one you'll take

142
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,280
five and then you'll eat one and then

143
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,280
the others will eat one one one or

144
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,240
exactly you're just taking one of them

145
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,320
yeah one black very good six wow yes

146
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,080
exactly so look the sequential part will

147
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,400
be one two

148
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,240
three four five and then the

149
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,720
parallelized bar right this is this

150
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,320
takes five five seconds five minutes or

151
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,960
whatever five you need

152
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,880
but now these can be taken by parallel

153
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,199
by five chords right

154
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,039
look at here to here only time equals

155
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,639
one so time would be five plus one

156
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,919
equals six

157
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,840
okay so we want ideally we want this

158
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,000
sequential part to as small as possible

159
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,639
right so we can have more costs to help

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,720
uh speed up and we want to

161
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,840
we we want to have these

162
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,120
this bit you know 100 i say now it's

163
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,800
just 50 right because look that ten and

164
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,520
then five of them can be

165
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,919
paralyzed but so this is 50

166
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,880
right so you want this percentage to go

167
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,880
up to 100 to have to utilize the

168
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,280
multi-course technology you have to have

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,560
more people to come to help right

170
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,319
so

171
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,800
so we're going to study a formula which

172
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,400
is has this uh sequential path

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,680
sequential part b

174
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,039
and then

175
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,800
if this b

176
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,160
this sequential part is b and then the

177
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,080
parabolic

178
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,080
the part which can be paralyzed but is

179
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,039
one minus b right

180
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,960
okay

181
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,039
because all these two added up to one

182
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,240
percent one one hundred percent which is

183
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,280
one okay

184
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,560
okay let's do this look

185
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,919
speed up equals t1 divided by tn right

186
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,800
and i can do this again t1

187
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:14,160
tn yeah tn equals what i can do is t1

188
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,639
and then it will be equals to the

189
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,680
sequential path plus part plus

190
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,520
the the parallelized path can be divided

191
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
by n right because look this is the

192
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,280
power which can be parallelized

193
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,440
which can be paralyzed but and then

194
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,639
they're n process you can

195
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,080
you can help to reduce the time to

196
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,479
one end right

197
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,960
okay so look remember we talked about b

198
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,840
is the sequential path so

199
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,560
so p if p is the what is the percentage

200
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,440
that can be parallelized so b p equals 1

201
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,240
minus b right p plus

202
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,000
p plus p equals 1 right this is the part

203
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,160
that can be parallelized but and this is

204
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,280
the part which cannot be parallelizable

205
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,599
so if we look we can cancel out these

206
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,680
so you'll be 1 divided by b

207
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,520
b let's uh

208
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,160
b will be

209
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,560
b will be 1 minus p right

210
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,240
so y minus p

211
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,120
1 minus b equals p plus p divided by n

212
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,680
right so look this is the formula

213
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,800
the maximum speed up okay i just look

214
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,199
from here to here right but p plus b is

215
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,520
the the percentage that can be needs to

216
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,400
be sequentially

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,800
you know

218
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,959
executed and the p is the part that you

219
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,360
can have more people to come to help

220
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,240
this 2 b plus p

221
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,240
b plus p equals 1 right ok so if i

222
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,039
substitute b with one minus

223
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,880
p

224
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,279
one minus p equals p and then we get

225
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,680
this right so this is the maximum we

226
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,839
call it amanda's law

227
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,760
maximum speed up maximum speed up

228
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,040
yeah okay so one p

229
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,200
is one what does it mean so one p is one

230
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,360
let's substitute one p is one means that

231
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
all these tasks can be a hundred percent

232
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
paralyzed but like like the ten coins

233
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,920
you can have ten people to come right to

234
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,320
half right so what p is one what's the

235
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,880
value one minus one zero

236
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,959
one minus n divided by n so when p is

237
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,839
one that will be becoming

238
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,360
one minus one that's zero plus one

239
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,920
divided by n

240
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,800
i was this value this is zero

241
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,959
yeah

242
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,519
one divided by one divided by n what's

243
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,440
what's this

244
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,720
what's the value of this every line any

245
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,279
one

246
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,519
right what's the value is one over one

247
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,800
over n

248
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,959
yeah

249
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,480
what's this that's n right

250
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,880
this is the linear

251
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,760
linear thing we talked about but if this

252
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,560
p is what zero

253
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,360
what happens if this p is zero

254
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,160
is one divided by one minus zero plus

255
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,040
zero divided n okay so this is easier

256
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,000
can tell me what's this

257
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,000
one and what's this

258
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,480
0 divided by n

259
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,240
n is bigger than 0 of obvious 0 divided

260
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,800
by 100 equals 1

261
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,920
0 this is 0. this is 1 right 1 divided

262
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,040
by 1

263
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,959
1 okay so it means that if no portion of

264
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,600
the word can be paralyzed and this is

265
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,519
sequential let's speed up is one because

266
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,839
these two are the same right

267
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,680
yeah because if you like 10 coins and

268
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,680
you need to eat them you need to

269
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,360
complete them one at a time

270
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,839
you can't have more people more course

271
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,519
to help you to shorten the time of the

272
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,120
of this work

273
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,560
but this time will be the same and the

274
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,839
speed up will be one

275
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,200
right

276
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:46,720
might make sense yeah so this formula

277
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,440
okay so today's this formula computes

278
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,440
the maximum speed up maximum speed up if

279
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,720
we use n

280
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,720
cos you know c b support or n p bar

281
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,839
to speed up the

282
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,920
the work the p percentage of what

283
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,600
p is the percentage of word that can be

284
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,200
parallelized but right

285
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,160
yeah that's the speed up okay and the

286
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,560
speed up is the time of using one people

287
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,839
to do it one course to do it divide it

288
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,160
by using mp to do it

289
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,120
okay any questions so far

290
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,279
no any question no

291
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,920
okay so to sum up we want to have uh

292
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,959
we want to design the the algorithm you

293
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
know to have this uh

294
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,600
p

295
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,160
bigger p

296
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,800
yeah bigger peak of a work that can be

297
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,800
parallelized right right if the work is

298
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,760
like zero percent parallelizable then it

299
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,760
can't be

300
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,040
speed up by using mathematical

301
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,040
technology okay

302
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,959
okay that's it for today bye bye
