1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
hello

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,080
hello mister here with me serrano all

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
right

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,559
yeah today we're going to talk about the

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,400
mode m-o-t-e what does it mean

6
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,040
what's mean mode

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,000
in mass mathematics in mass m is the

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,000
most

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,520
most yes the number that appears the

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,240
most okay

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,160
yeah

12
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
in the first early days we talked about

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,960
the average yeah average is the sum

14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,680
divided by the the length the count

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,359
right

16
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,840
and we talk about the medium what's

17
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,640
medium the most immediate like one two

18
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,040
three what's the middle number

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,640
two that's the medium okay and how about

20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,960
one two three four what's the medium two

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,600
is the required three two three two plus

22
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,640
three divided by two the average of the

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,280
most

24
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,320
the intermediate and the meter to right

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,320
3.5 2.5 way down okay so the mode is the

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,879
mode the number that appears the most in

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,440
a array list let's say

28
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,719
one two two three

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,399
three two what's this mode what's the

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,400
mode of it three two right two two yeah

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,479
two appears three times yeah okay so

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,439
today it's not very easy given a time

33
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,320
given an array we want to find the mode

34
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,720
easy

35
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,640
okay by the way if the number if the

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,880
most number appears twice then we return

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,159
the first one right for example if if

38
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,040
these

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,040
if this is four

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,520
no no if this is four what's the mug

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,080
oh sorry

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,000
what's the most two or three yeah we

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,720
just picked two right because they all

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
appear in the most times they are

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,759
two and three but we picked two the

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,640
first time okay

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,640
yeah yeah

48
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,079
how are we solving this

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,240
right we just open it by solving it how

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,439
how do we solving this what's your idea

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,320
what's your most intuitive uh what's the

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,640
most intuitive way of solving this kind

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,040
of problem like one thing set

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,880
how do we i mean

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,119
yeah we're using number but first of all

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,119
we need to find out which number appears

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,759
we need to find out the number of times

58
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,840
the most element appears right for

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,080
example we want to find out okay this

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,319
one element appears

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,720
most times which is two

62
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,319
now we can go through this array again

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,200
and if this

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,520
if this number

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
all appears

66
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,720
twice then we return it right

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
am i right for example this one

68
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,480
okay so we we need first of all we need

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,640
to go through this element uh arrays and

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,879
we find out that some element okay some

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,959
element appears

72
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,640
some element appears to us

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
appears three times and then we go

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,319
through the element again

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,400
yeah and we find out okay two appears

76
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,680
three times appears most times then we

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
determine it

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,480
doesn't make sense

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,720
okay so how how do we remember how do we

80
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,040
count the number number of frequency

81
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,720
counter yeah weather counter so look

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,519
this is a yeah if we counter it

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,680
what happened if counter a

84
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,840
from collection import counter if we

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
counter a so what does it give us if

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,120
this is

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,000
what does this give us

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,800
give us a dictionary right scenario

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,680
a

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,959
one appears one times two

91
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,680
appears three times three appear two

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,680
times okay so when we counter a

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,400
it would give us give us something like

94
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,560
this dictionary the keys are the unique

95
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,440
elements one two three yeah only one two

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,640
three appears in this one right and then

97
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,720
the the value this is called the value

98
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,280
is the number of times they appear right

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,920
yeah if we're not using this counter we

100
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,159
we can do this yeah d equals dictionary

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,720
yeah this is this center curly brace

102
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,920
yeah and this is calculated decent array

103
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,519
now we can say we can say well for i in

104
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,480
a for i in a if i in d yeah we need to

105
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,519
check because we if i in d then

106
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,400
d i plus equals 1 as if if it's

107
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,959
appearing

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,879
the first time then d i equals zero if

109
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,439
if we declaring additionally using this

110
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,200
kind of thing this is similar this is

111
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,599
the same as did yeah but if we're using

112
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,400
the default addition area this is a very

113
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,639
special way of declaring uh

114
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,199
map and we say we in

115
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,280
it means that if the key is not existing

116
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,840
in the dictionary then the byte for its

117
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:31,360
value is zero integer zero so we can say

118
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,600
for i in that a d i if this is d d i

119
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,320
plus equals one we don't need to check

120
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,240
if it appears before right but overall

121
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,400
this is the most simplest way counter a

122
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,800
and you give us this one two three so

123
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,280
now we just need to return the element

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,639
which element appears the most

125
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,960
which element by looking at this

126
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,280
dictionary two yeah okay

127
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,199
so how how do we do that because looking

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,840
at the value yeah yeah looking for value

129
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,199
so we can say look at look at this max

130
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,320
if this is t

131
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,120
max t if we give this max t it will give

132
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,479
us the most maximum of the key which is

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,880
three right

134
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,120
yeah but if we have max t top values

135
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,600
values

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,759
yeah if max dot d the value will give us

137
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,360
three right we want to give

138
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,160
we want to return

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
the key with most value right

140
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,600
yeah you

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,880
you find out the most value and then you

142
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,560
return the key

143
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,479
that's right and then we can do this

144
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,199
first of all we can do this yeah this is

145
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,080
n

146
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,600
and now we can go to four n for i

147
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,560
in a

148
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
if

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,120
if d i

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,280
d i equals n right if d i equals and

151
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,720
then return i right

152
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,039
make sense

153
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,000
yeah look look we can say this

154
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,800
for

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,759
i

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,479
in

157
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,520
num in a okay in a

158
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,800
if

159
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,360
if d i

160
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,360
equal or equal n and we can just return

161
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,880
i yeah easy yeah

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,360
okay yeah

163
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,280
oh okay i'm going to give you one

164
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,840
quicker way of doing this okay you can

165
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,479
just say

166
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,560
return

167
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,000
max

168
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
d

169
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,560
key

170
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,319
equals d dot get

171
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,039
and that's it

172
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,000
d

173
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,479
d is the counter right look this is the

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,919
counter and i want to return max t the

175
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,639
key

176
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,319
but key is d dot theta k is the value so

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,440
i want to return the item look

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,199
item which has the most

179
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,400
value

180
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,280
letter max t key comma key equals t

181
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,759
this is the syntax exactly doing this

182
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,720
okay max theta value

183
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,280
if we don't put the values is max t is

184
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,440
essentially the same as max t dot keys

185
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,319
it returns three which is not what we

186
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,199
want

187
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,759
and next the value is return d three

188
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,000
which is no we want to return two which

189
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,319
has the most key most value right so we

190
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,240
can say okay we can first the first way

191
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,000
is n equals that we get a three and now

192
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,240
we go through the numbers and check

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,960
which which value

194
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,039
which which value yeah which i which

195
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,160
element has the value

196
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,080
three right okay one is one no one two

197
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,560
okay appears three times and now we

198
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,880
return it all we can do here is this is

199
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,280
the center

200
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,639
alternative we can use this syntax okay

201
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,890
make sense

202
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,990
yeah what's the time complexity

203
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,990
[Music]

204
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,759
there are numbers in the area we also

205
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,639
we actually we need to go through twice

206
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,880
right

207
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,000
right counter

208
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,960
the counter

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,199
i went

210
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,680
and then we go through this again so

211
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,440
it's actually o to n

212
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,120
but we drop the constant yeah when we

213
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,919
talk about the time complexity we drop

214
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,120
the constant let's space complexity

215
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,240
count out

216
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,280
yeah

217
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,080
make sense

218
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,560
okay that's it for today bye-bye bye-bye

219
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,560
bye-bye okay that's it
