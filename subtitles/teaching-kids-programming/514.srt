1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,600
hello mystery mr lauren are you right

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,120
yeah

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,759
okay so

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,040
i put a zero here so another stop array

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,840
right sub array continues some array as

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,480
to subsequent

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,480
subsequence is not continuous separate

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,439
like one two three

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,359
if this is a ray sub array one two three

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,119
one two two three one two three continue

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,880
subsequence does not have to be

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,640
continuous one one three two right so

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,239
sub sequence

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,160
and sub array what's the relation

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,160
between subsequent and separate

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,000
is sub array or subsequence or is

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,680
subsequently separate sub array is

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,239
continuous right subsequence doesn't

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,680
have to be continuous so it's sub array

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,280
a subsequence

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,239
suffering

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,239
yes but it's subsequence of suffering

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,879
no that's right so subarray is a

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,199
subsequent so subsequent outside right

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,840
the coincidence yeah someone right here

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,359
right somewhere

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,879
so okay so zero i have an array contains

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,119
only zero you want to find out the

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,119
number total number of sub arrays

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,159
containing the zeros only for example

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:14,080
like how many sub arrays containing

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,799
zero in this case one one exactly

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,840
how many sub arrays containing zeros

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,080
how many

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,840
sub arrays are there not empty you know

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,439
empty is also a subreddit but we're

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,320
excluding empty here so how many sub

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,200
arrays here three three okay yeah so

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,520
here is one here three okay keep going

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,200
if i put one more how many sub arrays

41
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,280
six six

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,159
okay i put one more

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,159
ten

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,320
okay so what's the new thing what

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,320
happened

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,159
so what's on the next

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:54,960
15 okay what's the next

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,960
228 one okay so look if n equal if any

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,640
so how do you get this if i want to

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,599
generalize this so when n equals 10

51
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,920
what's the

52
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,640
answer how do we get it adding one more

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,480
becomes 15. how do we get 15

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,879
so if we know dn

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,160
what we have now is 10

56
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,360
right look

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,360
we n equals four we have ten if i have

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,920
one more n equals five

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,480
why is it fifteen why is the fifteen

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,480
come on when n is four i have ten when i

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,720
add one more zero what happened

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,120
how many more can we get how do we know

63
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,760
is fifteen here

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
this is 50 right we need to add five so

65
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,239
what happens why is this 5 coming from

66
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,959
if i add a 0 here why is it 5 extra

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,319
look i have a 0 here

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,640
if i had one zero how many extra

69
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,920
how many episodes right how many extra

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,159
why is it two

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,319
which two are actual

72
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,720
which two are actually i put a zero here

73
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,720
so which two are actual quantum count is

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,720
three

75
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,300
[Music]

76
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,599
yeah okay okay so what we have got is

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,360
the new one right we add one more zero

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,360
in new one and

79
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,599
the one the previous one right the

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,840
previous only one connects to it so

81
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,560
that's another one how about this

82
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,239
another two so if i add one more you

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,200
know how many

84
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,360
the original two we know is three yeah

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,880
and then here we have three more becomes

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,239
six

87
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,640
[Music]

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,360
right yeah what are the other two

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,200
the one of the beginnings

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,200
yeah okay so you see you get the excel

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,959
here and here right

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,000
yeah and then here right

93
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
okay

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,080
the same thing go here i put another

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,159
zero here

96
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,519
so what do we have

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,720
one

98
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,000
two

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,200
three

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,480
four

101
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,400
five

102
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,319
correct so if i add one i have n more so

103
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,200
this is the same thing as one plus two

104
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,200
plus three plus four plus and and at

105
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,400
least we know this

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,680
what's this

107
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,599
you notice

108
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,079
one plus two plus three plus four plus

109
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,079
two hundred what's the answer

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,130
what's the answer plus n equals two

111
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,240
hundred what's the answer

112
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:27,120
[Music]

113
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,800
value so this is the sum of

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,840
i equals 1

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,199
to n

116
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,320
and i right so here n equals 10 so this

117
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,680
would be n times m plus 1 divided by 2

118
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,240
yeah we talked about that in the early

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,360
days how do we get this so when n equals

120
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,240
4 4 times five divided by two

121
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,040
equals ten when equals five

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,919
what do we get five times five plus one

123
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,199
divided by two that's fifteen right

124
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,479
we are given an array of integers

125
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,880
so we want to find out how many

126
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,960
subarray containing zeros the previous

127
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,120
one we only have a array with containing

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,000
all zeros now we have an array with

129
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,479
numbers not necessary to be zeros so we

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,120
want to find out the

131
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,039
number of us sub array that containing

132
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,360
zeros how do we do it

133
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,039
how many sub arrays containing zeros in

134
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
this case

135
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,400
so what's the approach i mean look i

136
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,720
have an array

137
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,400
containing numbers not necessary to be

138
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,919
zero so we want to find out how many

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,880
arrays several were containing only

140
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,960
zeros

141
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,720
so how do we solve this problem

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,720
could you buy

143
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,720
where down grow by

144
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,759
how do we count so first of all we call

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,880
this right two we know how to count it

146
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,880
previously

147
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,199
we can learn how to count it we have how

148
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,280
to count we just add it together right

149
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,360
okay so how many sub arrays and then

150
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,840
zero two three yeah we know only three

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,639
how many here one how many one yeah

152
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,600
three plus one plus one right yeah we

153
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,319
use the group back this is array right

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,880
we talked about this little tours

155
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,160
from italy's import go back so what do

156
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,039
we have if we have ether to us this is

157
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,280
the package stock grew by

158
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,960
we talked about that through by

159
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,319
ar so this is an iterator if we say

160
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,680
for

161
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,360
a b

162
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,560
in group i so what what is a it will

163
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,800
give us a

164
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,199
a would be

165
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,560
a will be what a will be when a will be

166
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,919
one

167
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,240
then

168
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,400
this is the iterator right then the b

169
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,759
will be the integrator of the

170
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,280
actual continuous value so you'll be one

171
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,560
and then zero you'll be two zero

172
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,240
and then one will be one

173
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,680
okay and then zero will be one zero two

174
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,080
will be zero

175
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,639
and then zero will be zero so basically

176
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,400
if we run this it's a true or group five

177
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,120
the a will be the unique values the b

178
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,240
will be pointing to each group so

179
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,759
look if we have two zeros here so zero

180
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,319
and then you'll be two zeros another

181
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,840
example two two

182
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,360
two three

183
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,680
three two

184
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,560
okay so what do we have is a would be

185
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,120
two pointing to three twos

186
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,720
but this is a iterator okay three

187
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,919
would be

188
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,479
two three

189
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,360
and two would be one two okay

190
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,599
so if we go through this b the length of

191
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,479
the b right if we learn the length of b

192
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,199
which is n then we can count how many

193
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,000
a sub array containing the

194
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,800
zero so it's n plus n times one divided

195
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,280
by two right we can verify the value

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,319
when n is one one times

197
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,360
2 divided by 2 is 1 right 1 n is 2 2

198
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
times

199
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
3 divided by 2

200
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,520
2 times 3 divided by 2 equals 3 right

201
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,080
that's one way we use the group right

202
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,199
well the code is pretty simple okay so

203
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,560
let's just

204
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,960
read the code

205
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,599
out without writing it okay so

206
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:08,560
answer equals zero

207
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:11,199
for a b iterate to stop going by array

208
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,759
if okay we have to check if a is zero

209
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,120
right if a is not zero we don't count if

210
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,080
a is zero

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,800
then n equals length this b

212
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,520
and then answer plus equal n times n

213
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,160
plus one divided by two and that'll be

214
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,280
right another way would be originally

215
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,840
array and we use the counter zero

216
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,959
representing the number of zero we have

217
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,279
met if it's uh if it's not yellow we set

218
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,120
it to zero right if it's zero we plus

219
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,680
equal one

220
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,320
if i have a zero here i have m one more

221
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,880
zero then this zero contributes this

222
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,160
number of uh sub array right so look if

223
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,959
i have uh

224
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,680
three zero now right z equals three

225
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,399
i have one more zero so

226
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,040
the

227
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,160
total contribution of this zero is

228
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,880
plus

229
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,519
what three or four z will be

230
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,040
the number of zero before

231
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,959
and then the total number of

232
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,240
contribution will be

233
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:14,480
plus equal z right so define okay count

234
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,959
zero

235
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,959
array

236
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
answer equals

237
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,880
zero at the beginning

238
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,640
equal 0.

239
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,560
for

240
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,880
this is the the number of continuous

241
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,839
zero we have messed over for i in array

242
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,720
if i equal equals zero

243
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,399
right we have one more zero then c plus

244
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,120
equal one

245
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,200
answer plus equals z

246
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,680
errors will be set to

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,360
z to zero and written answer wow that's

248
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,920
so simple right

249
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,600
the time to maxi anybody the time

250
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,360
conductor we're going through that right

251
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,360
away exactly let's take honestly

252
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,839
a one yes so this is one way okay look

253
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,279
z

254
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,360
see here if we make one zero if we were

255
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,519
1 0 this is the

256
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,680
number of zeros we have met so far

257
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,519
continuous right if it's not zero we

258
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,480
reset it to zero right

259
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,600
and the answer plus equals zero

260
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,399
look zero we have one zero right c

261
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,560
equals zero so z equals one

262
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,560
right the answer will be the answer will

263
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,880
be one right

264
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,959
okay i have one more zero now

265
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,200
i have one more zero so

266
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,680
zero equals two

267
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,720
answer plus equals two

268
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,040
three okay now i have uh

269
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,160
i have one so what happened here this is

270
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,560
not zero so we set this to

271
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,000
zero right it's not zero okay another

272
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,720
zero what happened i increment this

273
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,279
look i increment this to one

274
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,440
and the answer plus equal one okay

275
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,519
okay your turn if i have one more zero

276
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,880
what happened

277
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,839
if this is one more zero what happened

278
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,760
to here this is the number of zero we

279
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,560
have made right so we need to plus equal

280
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,279
one right so two plus equals two okay so

281
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,120
if i have one more zero what happened

282
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,360
what happened

283
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,600
what should we do with these two

284
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,120
change it to 3 to 23. i know what should

285
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,720
we happen to hear

286
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,800
plus one plus b plus three okay okay

287
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,560
okay and i have one here what happened

288
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,680
what should we do now and we set it to

289
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,360
zero

290
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,279
okay okay zero what happened

291
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,519
comes another zero whatever

292
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,839
one and plus one

293
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,399
another zero one

294
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,959
three two plus two right

295
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,920
analogy one

296
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,560
three three plus three okay

297
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,360
and then i have one here whatever

298
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,160
reset it we set it to zero okay this is

299
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,079
simple right we just set it this zero

300
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,160
means that the number of zeros

301
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,440
continuous zero we have now including

302
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,680
the column

303
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,959
why we need to plus the z

304
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
as we said

305
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,959
zero

306
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,880
we have one and if i press one more zero

307
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,079
we need to plus two right if we have one

308
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,480
more zero

309
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,920
we have plus three right if we have one

310
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,560
more zero

311
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,160
plus one right y plus one

312
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,120
here one

313
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,040
two

314
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,360
three four

315
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,720
okay accumulate this is one way the

316
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,639
previous one

317
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,360
ether to group i

318
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,000
right when we use that function then we

319
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,160
can count how many

320
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,480
zeros in one group

321
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,839
if it's n n equals

322
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,040
list

323
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,600
b okay

324
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,279
for a b in italian go by

325
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,279
array

326
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:50,320
right and then answer plus equal n times

327
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,639
times n plus one divided by two okay

328
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,519
we use the mathematic formula

329
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,240
right

330
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,480
answer equals zero

331
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,440
and return answer

332
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,200
okay two ways easy

333
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,120
which way you prefer

334
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,480
okay last question which which way you

335
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,480
prefer which way

336
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,519
you think it's more easy to understand

337
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,880
that one

338
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,880
this one

339
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,120
using my eater tooth okay

340
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,720
one one last question what's the problem

341
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,639
what have you learned you know i'm going

342
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,600
to ask this question anyway okay so

343
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,440
anybody ryan you want to give it a go

344
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,800
learn about

345
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,279
yeah

346
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,600
how to

347
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,560
so what's the problem

348
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,800
and what are we doing is a list a list

349
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,959
of numbers numbers and then we want to

350
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,120
count how many

351
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,160
how many sub arrays that containing zero

352
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,040
right

353
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,240
right so at the beginning i show you how

354
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,440
to count

355
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,839
the number of zeros if it's an array

356
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,600
with only zeros right and then we just

357
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,240
have to

358
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,519
count each group of zeros separate and

359
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,639
add them together am right

360
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,680
yeah

361
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,120
okay

362
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,959
you want to give it a go

363
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,160
what's the problem and why have we

364
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,160
learned so far what's the approach

365
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,679
[Music]

366
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,279
a list of numbers we're done okay

367
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,320
would you okay even if it's a array

368
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,320
containing all zeros and the length is n

369
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,959
how many sub arrays

370
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,839
how many sub arrays

371
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,279
yeah the formula is less right what we

372
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,560
have to do is

373
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,480
count zeroes in each subroute with only

374
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,160
zeros and add it up together right the

375
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,920
time to next though and stay converts to

376
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,120
be a one okay and that's it for today

377
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,120
bye-bye

378
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,120
bye-bye

379
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,600
you
