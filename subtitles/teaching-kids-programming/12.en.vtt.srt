is 10
 

173
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,510
is 10
if i alpha i in s1

174
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
if i alpha i in s1
 

175
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,710
if i alpha i in s1
what am i missing here and then i can

176
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
what am i missing here and then i can
 

177
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,830
what am i missing here and then i can
say

178
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
say
 

179
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,350
say
if i want in

180
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
if i want in
 

181
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,189
if i want in
if this is no no actually if i in

182
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
if this is no no actually if i in
 

183
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,629
if this is no no actually if i in
in a1 then i

184
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
in a1 then i
 

185
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,710
in a1 then i
i can do what i can a1 i

186
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
i can do what i can a1 i
 

187
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,469
i can do what i can a1 i
plus equals one else

188
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
plus equals one else
 

189
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,950
plus equals one else
a1 i equals one okay

190
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
a1 i equals one okay
 

191
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,670
a1 i equals one okay
so what what what it means is that i do

192
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
so what what what it means is that i do
 

193
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,469
so what what what it means is that i do
please tell

194
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
please tell
 

195
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,070
please tell
t for example and we look t t

196
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
t for example and we look t t
 

197
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,430
t for example and we look t t
and then if t is in a1 a1 is empty so

198
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
and then if t is in a1 a1 is empty so
 

199
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,710
and then if t is in a1 a1 is empty so
so it's not like s then

200
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
so it's not like s then
 

201
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,950
so it's not like s then
and a one t would be equals one so what

202
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
and a one t would be equals one so what
 

203
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,749
and a one t would be equals one so what
do we have

204
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
do we have
 

205
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,469
do we have
this curly brace and then we have this t

206
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
this curly brace and then we have this t
 

207
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,950
this curly brace and then we have this t
and which is

208
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
and which is
 

209
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,230
and which is
one okay and going back again t

210
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
one okay and going back again t
 

211
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,150
one okay and going back again t
e also is not not appear so we put an e

212
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
e also is not not appear so we put an e
 

213
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,270
e also is not not appear so we put an e
here and then n here

214
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
here and then n here
 

215
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,469
here and then n here
if i have another like uh tennis

216
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
if i have another like uh tennis
 

217
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,870
if i have another like uh tennis
that means okay it is tennis and n

218
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
that means okay it is tennis and n
 

219
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,909
that means okay it is tennis and n
okay if n it appears on in a1

220
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
okay if n it appears on in a1
 

221
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,070
okay if n it appears on in a1
so these will be increment one right

222
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
so these will be increment one right
 

223
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,950
so these will be increment one right
okay

224
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
okay
 

225
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,150
okay
yeah you'll get it yeah do you get it

226
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
yeah you'll get it yeah do you get it
 

227
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,430
yeah you'll get it yeah do you get it
and then i will be i and

228
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
and then i will be i and
 

229
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,430
and then i will be i and
s will be one as well so basically this

230
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
s will be one as well so basically this
 

231
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,390
s will be one as well so basically this
is the map

232
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
is the map
 

233
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,830
is the map
of counting that

234
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
of counting that
 

235
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,029
of counting that
each letter and the how many times

236
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
each letter and the how many times
 

237
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,189
each letter and the how many times
they appear in a word am right every

238
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
they appear in a word am right every
 

239
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,070
they appear in a word am right every
look at this

240
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
look at this
 

241
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,110
look at this
yes okay so we can copy this to the s2

242
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
yes okay so we can copy this to the s2
 

243
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,670
yes okay so we can copy this to the s2
and then

244
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
and then
 

245
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,350
and then
return a1

246
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
return a1
 

247
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,390
return a1
equals a2 right then we can compare if

248
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
equals a2 right then we can compare if
 

249
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,230
equals a2 right then we can compare if
two mappings are the same

250
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
two mappings are the same
 

251
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,270
two mappings are the same
got it yeah but this is

252
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
got it yeah but this is
 

253
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,469
got it yeah but this is
too much complicated right and we can

254
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
too much complicated right and we can
 

255
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,110
too much complicated right and we can
we can avoid checking checking this the

256
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
we can avoid checking checking this the
 

257
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,909
we can avoid checking checking this the
key if it's

258
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
key if it's
 

259
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,469
key if it's
already there so how do we do it we can

260
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
already there so how do we do it we can
 

261
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,790
already there so how do we do it we can
use it another way

262
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
use it another way
 

263
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,870
use it another way
look look

264
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
look look
 

265
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,070
look look
a1 for range

266
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
a1 for range
 

267
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,870
a1 for range
no no no we can do this actually

268
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
no no no we can do this actually
 

269
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,390
no no no we can do this actually
actually we can do this look

270
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
actually we can do this look
 

271
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,150
actually we can do this look
we can do this

272
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160

 

273
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,670

dictionary one equals

274
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
dictionary one equals
 

275
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,110
dictionary one equals
look this is the magic word counter

276
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
look this is the magic word counter
 

277
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,670
look this is the magic word counter
counting what's counter mean powder f1

278
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
counting what's counter mean powder f1
 

279
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,830
counting what's counter mean powder f1
and then and then d1 d2 equals counter

280
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
and then and then d1 d2 equals counter
 

281
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,550
and then and then d1 d2 equals counter
s2 and then what do we do

282
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
s2 and then what do we do
 

283
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,350
s2 and then what do we do
there's a magic plan here can you guess

284
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
there's a magic plan here can you guess
 

285
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,830
there's a magic plan here can you guess
are you

286
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
are you
 

287
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:39,589
are you
kidding me yes you got the first part

288
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599

 

289
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,670

what's the other one another one how

290
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
what's the other one another one how
 

291
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,869
what's the other one another one how
many two how many i want to compare if

292
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
many two how many i want to compare if
 

293
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,790
many two how many i want to compare if
two are the same so what's that

294
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
two are the same so what's that
 

295
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,830
two are the same so what's that
equal double equal okay so you see two

296
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
equal double equal okay so you see two
 

297
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,990
equal double equal okay so you see two
mapping so this counter as one

298
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
mapping so this counter as one
 

299
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,749
mapping so this counter as one
look if a s1 is uh what do we call it uh

300
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
look if a s1 is uh what do we call it uh
 

301
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,469
look if a s1 is uh what do we call it uh
10 yeah

302
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:56,479
10 yeah
 

303
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,430
10 yeah
let's call it 10 for example so after

304
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
let's call it 10 for example so after
 

305
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,990
let's call it 10 for example so after
this

306
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
this
 

307
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,430
this
what does this what what is d e 1 e 1

308
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
what does this what what is d e 1 e 1
 

309
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,790
what does this what what is d e 1 e 1
is a dictionary alright look

310
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
is a dictionary alright look
 

311
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,150
is a dictionary alright look
which is t equals 1

312
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
which is t equals 1
 

313
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,350
which is t equals 1
e equals 1 and

314
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
e equals 1 and
 

315
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,469
e equals 1 and
equals 1 yes

316
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479

 

317
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,830

and d2 if this is net

318
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
and d2 if this is net
 

319
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,909
and d2 if this is net
and et right you'll be also this

320
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
and et right you'll be also this
 

321
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,510
and et right you'll be also this
remember the mapping in

322
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
remember the mapping in
 

323
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,550
remember the mapping in
in in the dictionary it

324
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
in in the dictionary it
 

325
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,870
in in the dictionary it
is not have order does not have other it

326
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
is not have order does not have other it
 

327
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,029
is not have order does not have other it
does it only has key value pair so it

328
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
does it only has key value pair so it
 

329
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,430
does it only has key value pair so it
means

330
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
means
 

331
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,469
means
t letter has only appear once in these

332
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
t letter has only appear once in these
 

333
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,310
t letter has only appear once in these
and these okay so there are two mappings

334
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
and these okay so there are two mappings
 

335
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,630
and these okay so there are two mappings
that is exactly the same

336
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
that is exactly the same
 

337
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,190
that is exactly the same
yes so got it so this is the

338
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
yes so got it so this is the
 

339
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,990
yes so got it so this is the
an object that we can use counter which

340
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
an object that we can use counter which
 

341
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,230
an object that we can use counter which
is

342
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
is
 

343
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,790
is
already taking this string and mapping

344
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
already taking this string and mapping
 

345
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,790
already taking this string and mapping
it so count how many times

346
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
it so count how many times
 

347
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,829
it so count how many times
of letters appears in each in in each

348
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
of letters appears in each in in each
 

349
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,230
of letters appears in each in in each
string

350
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
string
 

351
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,870
string
okay yes so another way of doing it

352
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
okay yes so another way of doing it
 

353
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,509
okay yes so another way of doing it
let's talk about another way or

354
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
let's talk about another way or
 

355
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,949
let's talk about another way or
simplifying

356
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
simplifying
 

357
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,790
simplifying
please traditionally remember we talk

358
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
please traditionally remember we talk
 

359
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,550
please traditionally remember we talk
about this decision area

360
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
about this decision area
 

361
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,110
about this decision area
and we can have another object called d1

362
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
and we can have another object called d1
 

363
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,670
and we can have another object called d1
equal

364
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
equal
 

365
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,509
equal
default what's deforming

366
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
default what's deforming
 

367
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,920
default what's deforming
before what does it mean before

368
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:21,930
before what does it mean before

no it means that it's the given one if

372
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
no it means that it's the given one if
 

373
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,230
no it means that it's the given one if
you don't specify it okay

374
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
you don't specify it okay
 

375
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,829
you don't specify it okay
yeah okay can you sit down please

sit on the chair please

382
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
sit on the chair please
 

383
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,190
sit on the chair please
yeah okay now before

384
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200

 

385
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,070

and then another one p2 equals default

386
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
and then another one p2 equals default
 

387
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,350
and then another one p2 equals default
date so what can we do before d

388
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
date so what can we do before d
 

389
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,430
date so what can we do before d
we will give an integer okay so we say

390
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
we will give an integer okay so we say
 

391
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,990
we will give an integer okay so we say
it's uh this mapping will

392
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
it's uh this mapping will
 

393
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,069
it's uh this mapping will
map into integers so now we can do this

394
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
map into integers so now we can do this
 

395
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,750
map into integers so now we can do this
for i in s1 we iterated

396
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
for i in s1 we iterated
 

397
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,150
for i in s1 we iterated
right instead of checking this key

398
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
right instead of checking this key
 

399
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,269
right instead of checking this key
appears in addition

400
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
appears in addition
 

401
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,829
appears in addition
we don't need to check it this is the

402
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
we don't need to check it this is the
 

403
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,750
we don't need to check it this is the
beauty of using the default div

404
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
beauty of using the default div
 

405
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,350
beauty of using the default div
we can just do this d1 b1 what

406
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
we can just do this d1 b1 what
 

407
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,710
we can just do this d1 b1 what
i plus equals one okay

408
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
i plus equals one okay
 

409
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,870
i plus equals one okay
and then the next one is one for i we

410
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
and then the next one is one for i we
 

411
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,069
and then the next one is one for i we
iterate over the

412
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
iterate over the
 

413
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,829
iterate over the
s2 string d uh d2

414
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
s2 string d uh d2
 

415
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,910
s2 string d uh d2
i plus equals one and then what's next

416
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
i plus equals one and then what's next
 

417
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,350
i plus equals one and then what's next
what's here everywhere what's this

418
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
what's here everywhere what's this
 

419
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,470
what's here everywhere what's this
return where is that

420
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
return where is that
 

421
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:54,310
return where is that
d1

422
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320

 

423
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,710

okay so this is one way of doing it okay

424
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
okay so this is one way of doing it okay
 

425
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,590
okay so this is one way of doing it okay
and

426
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
and
 

427
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,470
and
how many how many messes have i tell you

428
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
how many how many messes have i tell you
 

429
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,949
how many how many messes have i tell you
have i told you today

430
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
have i told you today
 

431
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,590
have i told you today
yeah three actually three yeah this one

432
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
yeah three actually three yeah this one
 

433
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,750
yeah three actually three yeah this one
the previous one and then another one

434
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
the previous one and then another one
 

435
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,310
the previous one and then another one
um what else

436
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320

 

437
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,430

this is

438
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
this is
 

439
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,550
this is
so any questions which one which method

440
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
so any questions which one which method
 

441
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,750
so any questions which one which method
do you like best

442
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
do you like best
 

443
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,030
do you like best
this one this one no

444
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
this one this one no
 

445
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,949
this one this one no
no remember we have the shortest one

446
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
no remember we have the shortest one
 

447
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,910
no remember we have the shortest one
remember it's number two

448
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
remember it's number two
 

449
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,670
remember it's number two
if you shortest one you don't need this

450
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
if you shortest one you don't need this
 

451
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,990
if you shortest one you don't need this
right and then you just need to replace

452
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
right and then you just need to replace
 

453
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,630
right and then you just need to replace
these

454
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
these
 

455
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,870
these
in what using what counter remember

456
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
in what using what counter remember
 

457
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,590
in what using what counter remember
counter f1 counter x2 right

458
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
counter f1 counter x2 right
 

459
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,710
counter f1 counter x2 right
okay so these two methods are

460
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
okay so these two methods are
 

461
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,069
okay so these two methods are
easy simple this one okay so pick one

462
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
easy simple this one okay so pick one
 

463
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,629
easy simple this one okay so pick one
and then code it on your computer and

464
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
and then code it on your computer and
 

465
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,990
and then code it on your computer and
then the last thing

466
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
then the last thing
 

467
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:06,509
then the last thing
don't forget to say goodbye

468
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:06,519

 

469
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,710

oh baby

470
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
oh baby
 

471
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,519
oh baby
okay okay now
