00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:55,519
then we can we can so our task is to
 

171
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,350
then we can we can so our task is to
divide the list and all the lists

172
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
divide the list and all the lists
 

173
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,350
divide the list and all the lists
into a small pieces and then logic back

174
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
into a small pieces and then logic back
 

175
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,830
into a small pieces and then logic back
look if these are this like look

176
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
look if these are this like look
 

177
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,949
look if these are this like look
if two four five

178
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
if two four five
 

179
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,309
if two four five
six one and

180
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
six one and
 

181
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,350
six one and
three okay you will have six numbers all

182
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
three okay you will have six numbers all
 

183
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,309
three okay you will have six numbers all
right

184
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
right
 

185
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,990
right
ryan sit down if you have six numbers

186
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
ryan sit down if you have six numbers
 

187
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,030
ryan sit down if you have six numbers
away yes i am you are looking you're not

188
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
away yes i am you are looking you're not
 

189
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,830
away yes i am you are looking you're not
looking okay

190
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
looking okay
 

191
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,629
looking okay
if you have six months okay now we want

192
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
if you have six months okay now we want
 

193
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,390
if you have six months okay now we want
to solve this make this saudi

194
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
to solve this make this saudi
 

195
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,830
to solve this make this saudi
yeah so how do we do this we first

196
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
yeah so how do we do this we first
 

197
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,469
yeah so how do we do this we first
seventy

198
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
seventy
 

199
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,870
seventy
three four five six yes my computer we

200
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
three four five six yes my computer we
 

201
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,990
three four five six yes my computer we
can do this look

202
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
can do this look
 

203
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,270
can do this look
we can divide this into two right

204
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
we can divide this into two right
 

205
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,670
we can divide this into two right
we have two equal parts yeah yeah two

206
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
we have two equal parts yeah yeah two
 

207
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,469
we have two equal parts yeah yeah two
equal parts

208
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
equal parts
 

209
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,150
equal parts
then we we saw this if we can make this

210
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
then we we saw this if we can make this
 

211
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,550
then we we saw this if we can make this
sort

212
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
sort
 

213
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,350
sort
and make this sorted then we can use

214
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
and make this sorted then we can use
 

215
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,790
and make this sorted then we can use
remember the merge

216
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
remember the merge
 

217
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,189
remember the merge
function yeah remember with the merge

218
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
function yeah remember with the merge
 

219
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,310
function yeah remember with the merge
function

220
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
function
 

221
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,749
function
yeah to merge these two parts right yeah

222
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
yeah to merge these two parts right yeah
 

223
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,950
yeah to merge these two parts right yeah
yes so in order to solve this we again

224
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
yes so in order to solve this we again
 

225
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,670
yes so in order to solve this we again
we

226
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
we
 

227
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,950
we
stop we partition this into half right

228
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
stop we partition this into half right
 

229
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,790
stop we partition this into half right
okay do you get it okay

230
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
okay do you get it okay
 

231
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,990
okay do you get it okay
we position this into half

232
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
we position this into half
 

233
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,430
we position this into half
so it could yeah yeah i know it could be

234
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
so it could yeah yeah i know it could be
 

235
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,870
so it could yeah yeah i know it could be
you can put it this way it doesn't

236
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
you can put it this way it doesn't
 

237
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,790
you can put it this way it doesn't
have to because three numbers you can

238
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
have to because three numbers you can
 

239
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,390
have to because three numbers you can
equally be two parts but

240
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
equally be two parts but
 

241
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,629
equally be two parts but
how about it let's do it this way okay

242
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
how about it let's do it this way okay
 

243
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,830
how about it let's do it this way okay
do this way

244
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
do this way
 

245
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,070
do this way
okay now this one number it's already

246
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
okay now this one number it's already
 

247
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,150
okay now this one number it's already
sauteed yeah we don't need to saute it

248
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
sauteed yeah we don't need to saute it
 

249
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,629
sauteed yeah we don't need to saute it
now we want to make this sauteed yeah

250
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
now we want to make this sauteed yeah
 

251
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,830
now we want to make this sauteed yeah
already salted

252
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
already salted
 

253
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,189
already salted
but we don't but we have to put it into

254
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
but we don't but we have to put it into
 

255
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,150
but we don't but we have to put it into
two pieces

256
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
two pieces
 

257
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,550
two pieces
now two is salty four is started all

258
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
now two is salty four is started all
 

259
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,350
now two is salty four is started all
right

260
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
right
 

261
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,390
right
so then i use these to merge this into

262
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
so then i use these to merge this into
 

263
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:40,710
so then i use these to merge this into
two

264
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
two
 

265
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,510
two
right eleven two four fourteen and two

275
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,430

don't worry when is salted when this

276
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
don't worry when is salted when this
 

277
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,590
don't worry when is salted when this
when this bit salted is one three six

278
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
when this bit salted is one three six
 

279

three two one
 

311
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,230
three two one
six how do we solve these four numbers

312
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
six how do we solve these four numbers
 

313
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,950
six how do we solve these four numbers
easy what do three things i know how do

314
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
easy what do three things i know how do
 

315
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,790
easy what do three things i know how do
we solve a computer look

316
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
we solve a computer look
 

317
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,870
we solve a computer look
first of all divide it into two two

318
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
first of all divide it into two two
 

319
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,189
first of all divide it into two two
pieces two pieces yeah

320
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
pieces two pieces yeah
 

321
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,629
pieces two pieces yeah
and then these two pieces

322
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
and then these two pieces
 

323
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,830
and then these two pieces
put it into half so these four pieces

324
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
put it into half so these four pieces
 

325
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,830
put it into half so these four pieces
are already sorted by their own right if

326
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
are already sorted by their own right if
 

327
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,830
are already sorted by their own right if
we merge these two

328
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
we merge these two
 

329
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,150
we merge these two
we have two three if we merge these two

330
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
we have two three if we merge these two
 

331
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,870
we have two three if we merge these two
there will be one

332
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
there will be one
 

333
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,110
there will be one
six and how about we merge two three and

334
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
six and how about we merge two three and
 

335
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,710
six and how about we merge two three and
one six then will become one

336
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
one six then will become one
 

337
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,390
one six then will become one
two three six so so

338
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
two three six so so
 

339
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,390
two three six so so
you see how we get it we divide

340
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
you see how we get it we divide
 

341
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,589
you see how we get it we divide
and solve each part yeah divide and

342
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
and solve each part yeah divide and
 

343
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,950
and solve each part yeah divide and
solidify

344
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
solidify
 

345
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,029
solidify
divide and conquer right

346
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039

 

347
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,629

okay so let's try to write a

348
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
okay so let's try to write a
 

349
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,230
okay so let's try to write a
code okay so let's try to go

350
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
code okay so let's try to go
 

351
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:50,790
code okay so let's try to go
the code is important

352
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800

 

353
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,950

let's skip the first plate which is the

354
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
let's skip the first plate which is the
 

355
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,950
let's skip the first plate which is the
much tooth to list okay

356
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
much tooth to list okay
 

357
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,150
much tooth to list okay
or we can come up later like

358
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160

 

359
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,029

if we want to merge merge to list a and

360
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
if we want to merge merge to list a and
 

361
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:05,350
if we want to merge merge to list a and
b

362
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
b
 

363
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,070
b
yeah a and b what am i missing here

364
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
yeah a and b what am i missing here
 

365
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,790
yeah a and b what am i missing here
column

366
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
column
 

367
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:23,189
column
okay yeah babe okay now

368
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199

 

369
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,589

if you are taking a parameter much merge

370
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
if you are taking a parameter much merge
 

371
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,629
if you are taking a parameter much merge
and ray

372
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
and ray
 

373
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,710
and ray
we imagine array okay so let's start

374
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
we imagine array okay so let's start
 

375
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,909
we imagine array okay so let's start
with this bit first

376
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
with this bit first
 

377
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,949
with this bit first
if we merge this array uh much saw this

378
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
if we merge this array uh much saw this
 

379
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:33,750
if we merge this array uh much saw this
array okay

380
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
array okay
 

381
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,589
array okay
to make it simpler so much salt to salt

382
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
to make it simpler so much salt to salt
 

383
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,469
to make it simpler so much salt to salt
multi sauce

384
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
multi sauce
 

385
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,750
multi sauce
merge thought okay

386
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
merge thought okay
 

387
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,949
merge thought okay
so now we need to check if the lens

388
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
so now we need to check if the lens
 

389
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,550
so now we need to check if the lens
yeah if it's smaller than even what

390
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
yeah if it's smaller than even what
 

391
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,790
yeah if it's smaller than even what
if it's nothing if the element is

392
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
if it's nothing if the element is
 

393
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,630
if it's nothing if the element is
nothing empty or it's one element it's

394
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
nothing empty or it's one element it's
 

395
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,710
nothing empty or it's one element it's
already sorted right all right

396
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
already sorted right all right
 

397
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,630
already sorted right all right
it's already sorted

398
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640

 

399
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,790

array all right

400
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800

 

401
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,389

so we return return array right if it's

402
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
so we return return array right if it's
 

403
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,990
so we return return array right if it's
already one element we return it right

404
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
already one element we return it right
 

405
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,990
already one element we return it right
okay so now we need to find the middle

406
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
okay so now we need to find the middle
 

407
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,350
okay so now we need to find the middle
path right

408
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
path right
 

409
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,910
path right
look we need we need to find the middle

410
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
look we need we need to find the middle
 

411
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,790
look we need we need to find the middle
part to

412
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
part to
 

413
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,829
part to
to split to the least

414
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
to split to the least
 

415
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,190
to split to the least
into too hard right yes so now we take

416
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
into too hard right yes so now we take
 

417
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,269
into too hard right yes so now we take
the middle half equals length

418
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
the middle half equals length
 

419
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,310
the middle half equals length
this is length length

420
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
this is length length
 

421
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,430
this is length length
and divided by two right yeah

422
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
and divided by two right yeah
 

423
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,990
and divided by two right yeah
divided by two okay now the first half

424
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
divided by two okay now the first half
 

425
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,870
divided by two okay now the first half
the left

426
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
the left
 

427
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,670
the left
the left half look now we have an array

428
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
the left half look now we have an array
 

429
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,190
the left half look now we have an array
this is array yeah

430
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
this is array yeah
 

431
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,030
this is array yeah
and we have calculated the middle part

432
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
and we have calculated the middle part
 

433
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,630
and we have calculated the middle part
yeah and then

434
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
yeah and then
 

435
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,829
yeah and then
we want to solve this anyway can you

436
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
we want to solve this anyway can you
 

437
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,870
we want to solve this anyway can you
look at daddy please

438
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
look at daddy please
 

439
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,470
look at daddy please
but you know what you're walking can you

440
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
but you know what you're walking can you
 

441
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,710
but you know what you're walking can you
sit down and look at me okay

442
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
sit down and look at me okay
 

443
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,230
sit down and look at me okay
okay you already know the left part and

444
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
okay you already know the left part and
 

445
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,430
okay you already know the left part and
the right part okay

446
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
the right part okay
 

447
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,509
the right part okay
what am i writing now you already know

448
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
what am i writing now you already know
 

449
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,110
what am i writing now you already know
okay so left left now the left part

450
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
okay so left left now the left part
 

451
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,470
okay so left left now the left part
equals this ar we are we are doing it

452
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
equals this ar we are we are doing it
 

453
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,310
equals this ar we are we are doing it
until the meat right yeah

454
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
until the meat right yeah
 

455
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,350
until the meat right yeah
so now this is the left is this one yeah

456
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
so now this is the left is this one yeah
 

457
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,710
so now this is the left is this one yeah
this is that right so

458
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
this is that right so
 

459
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,750
this is that right so
what what so right right

460
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760

 

461
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,190

mid column it means

462
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
mid column it means
 

463
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,990
mid column it means
start some meat and then this part okay

464
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
start some meat and then this part okay
 

465
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,550
start some meat and then this part okay
and now

466
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
and now
 

467
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,190
and now
we have the right arrow left hand what

468
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
we have the right arrow left hand what
 

469
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,550
we have the right arrow left hand what
what we are doing now

470
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
what we are doing now
 

471
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,550
what we are doing now
we call it sort much so functions to

472
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
we call it sort much so functions to
 

473
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,389
we call it sort much so functions to
solve these two parts right

474
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
solve these two parts right
 

475
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,750
solve these two parts right
so so we are calling these two functions

476
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
so so we are calling these two functions
 

477
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,150
so so we are calling these two functions
right

478
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
right
 

479
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,790
right
left equals that right equals that then

480
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
left equals that right equals that then
 

481
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,990
left equals that right equals that then
we need to sort

482
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
we need to sort
 

483
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,269
we need to sort
much salt

484
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279

 

485
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,550

merge salt arr left

486
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
merge salt arr left
 

487
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,550
merge salt arr left
because we are sorting the left bit and

488
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
because we are sorting the left bit and
 

489
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,550
because we are sorting the left bit and
we assign it to

490
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
we assign it to
 

491
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,949
we assign it to
we can assign it to left as well and

492
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
we can assign it to left as well and
 

493
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,790
we can assign it to left as well and
right

494
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
right
 

495
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,310
right
equals multi-thought

496
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320

 

497
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,590

right

498
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600

 

499
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,230

right so now these two bits are already

500
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
right so now these two bits are already
 

501
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,870
right so now these two bits are already
in order

502
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
in order
 

503
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:22,550
in order
now what we need to do

504
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560

 

505
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,590

left and right right

506
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600

 

507
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,269

okay so you you get it did you get it

508
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
okay so you you get it did you get it
 

509
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,230
okay so you you get it did you get it
yes yeah do you get it that's one do you

510
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
yes yeah do you get it that's one do you
 

511
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,310
yes yeah do you get it that's one do you
get it

512
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
get it
 

513
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:48,310
get it
look so uh

514
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320

 

515
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,710

there's an array right it's a list a

516
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
there's an array right it's a list a
 

517
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,470
there's an array right it's a list a
number a few numbers

518
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
number a few numbers
 

519
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,150
number a few numbers
like that yeah no no no

520
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
like that yeah no no no
 

521
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,590
like that yeah no no no
look at daddy

522
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600

 

523
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,030

listen ryan listen okay i am

524
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
listen ryan listen okay i am
 

525
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,310
listen ryan listen okay i am
okay listen do you don't get me look

526
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
okay listen do you don't get me look
 

527
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,350
okay listen do you don't get me look
and at least

528
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
and at least
 

529
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,550
and at least
so i want to sort at least a few numbers

530
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
so i want to sort at least a few numbers
 

531
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,829
so i want to sort at least a few numbers
so first step divide it into half yeah

532
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
so first step divide it into half yeah
 

533
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,949
so first step divide it into half yeah
and then my soul is stupid once these

534
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
and then my soul is stupid once these
 

535
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,710
and then my soul is stupid once these
are thoughts

536
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720

 

537
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,269

so so i'm here and we do recursively and

538
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
so so i'm here and we do recursively and
 

539
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,550
so so i'm here and we do recursively and
dividing partitioning this array into

540
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
dividing partitioning this array into
 

541
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,590
dividing partitioning this array into
smaller b smaller smaller and here it

542
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
smaller b smaller smaller and here it
 

543
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,790
smaller b smaller smaller and here it
becomes only one element of nothing yeah

544
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
becomes only one element of nothing yeah
 

545
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,870
becomes only one element of nothing yeah
one is only one element it's already

546
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
one is only one element it's already
 

547
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,629
one is only one element it's already
sorted right i give you a number i say

548
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
sorted right i give you a number i say
 

549
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,269
sorted right i give you a number i say
it's salty

550
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,279
it's salty
 

551
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,310
it's salty
am i right it is right yes if i give you

552
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
am i right it is right yes if i give you
 

553
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,350
am i right it is right yes if i give you
a number of three

554
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
a number of three
 

555
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,750
a number of three
i said is it sauteed yes yes of course

556
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
i said is it sauteed yes yes of course
 

557
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,350
i said is it sauteed yes yes of course
it's not one number it's not it's in the

558
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
it's not one number it's not it's in the
 

559
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,310
it's not one number it's not it's in the
right place

560
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
right place
 

561
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,110
right place
if we started and then if we have two

562
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
if we started and then if we have two
 

563
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,590
if we started and then if we have two
otherwise when we have this uh

564
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
otherwise when we have this uh
 

565
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,389
otherwise when we have this uh
already sorted part if that this one

566
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
already sorted part if that this one
 

567
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,990
already sorted part if that this one
number is sorted there

568
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
number is sorted there
 

569
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,190
number is sorted there
and this number is sort uh is

570
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
and this number is sort uh is
 

571
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,269
and this number is sort uh is
sorted then what we do we merge it

572
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
sorted then what we do we merge it
 

573
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,629
sorted then what we do we merge it
remember we have mu

574
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
remember we have mu
 

575
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,509
remember we have mu
we know how to merge two sorted list

576
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
we know how to merge two sorted list
 

577
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,150
we know how to merge two sorted list
right

578
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
right
 

579
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,430
right
we know this i'm matching yes

580
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440

 

581
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,750

so when you merge it you can merge it

582
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:19,760
so when you merge it you can merge it
 

583
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,350
so when you merge it you can merge it
merge it

584
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
merge it
 

585
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,870
merge it
to into a bigger path all right

586
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
to into a bigger path all right
 

587
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,910
to into a bigger path all right
okay so now okay let's review how to

588
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
okay so now okay let's review how to
 

589
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,030
okay so now okay let's review how to
how to i know right now look

590
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
how to i know right now look
 

591
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,509
how to i know right now look
we we are calling the merge here which

592
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519
we we are calling the merge here which
 

593
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,949
we we are calling the merge here which
is not implemented here right

594
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
is not implemented here right
 

595
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,269
is not implemented here right
yeah but this is the important part

596
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
yeah but this is the important part
 

597
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,150
yeah but this is the important part
merge

598
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
merge
 

599
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,230
merge
one two into one two right yes

600
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
one two into one two right yes
 

601
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,189
one two into one two right yes
okay let's buy this merge let's like

602
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199
okay let's buy this merge let's like
 

603
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:45,990
okay let's buy this merge let's like
review it

604
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
review it
 

605
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,110
review it
we we know how to do this a few days ago

606
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
we we know how to do this a few days ago
 

607
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,870
we we know how to do this a few days ago
right let's write it again okay

608
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
right let's write it again okay
 

609
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,269
right let's write it again okay
look and you correct me if i'm wrong

610
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
look and you correct me if i'm wrong
 

611
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,069
look and you correct me if i'm wrong
very much

612
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:56,079

 

613
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,350

a b column yeah i didn't did that

614
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
a b column yeah i didn't did that
 

615
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,949
a b column yeah i didn't did that
yeah merge a b 9 1 we need to get the i

616
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
yeah merge a b 9 1 we need to get the i
 

617
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,430
yeah merge a b 9 1 we need to get the i
three pointing to the beginning of both

618
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
three pointing to the beginning of both
 

619
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,870
three pointing to the beginning of both
yeah what are we doing

620
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
yeah what are we doing
 

621
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,069
yeah what are we doing
most two searches remember no

622
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
most two searches remember no
 

623
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,189
most two searches remember no
i don't certainly i

624
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
i don't certainly i
 

625
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,710
i don't certainly i
j l a l b equals

626
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
j l a l b equals
 

627
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,150
j l a l b equals
zero zero length air a

628
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
zero zero length air a
 

629
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,829
zero zero length air a
length b right so this is just two

630
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
length b right so this is just two
 

631
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,470
length b right so this is just two
two or two solid list you have to sort

632
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
two or two solid list you have to sort
 

633
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,189
two or two solid list you have to sort
this

634
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
this
 

635
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,990
this
one three five two four six and we're

636
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
one three five two four six and we're
 

637
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,470
one three five two four six and we're
gonna

638
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
gonna
 

639
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,350
gonna
put this into one two three four five

640
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
put this into one two three four five
 

641
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,710
put this into one two three four five
six yes

642
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
six yes
 

643
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,150
six yes
okay now why

644
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
okay now why
 

645
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,829
okay now why
i smaller than what y smaller than y

646
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
i smaller than what y smaller than y
 

647
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,970
i smaller than what y smaller than y
is

648
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:44,980
is
 

649
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:55,509
is
[Music]

650
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519

 

651
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,310

why these two pointers are the end now

652
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
why these two pointers are the end now
 

653
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,670
why these two pointers are the end now
we need to compare if

654
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
we need to compare if
 

655
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,350
we need to compare if
a i is smaller than b

656
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
a i is smaller than b
 

657
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,470
a i is smaller than b
b j right

658
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480

 

659
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,870

it's okay if a if one element is smaller

660
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
it's okay if a if one element is smaller
 

661
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,829
it's okay if a if one element is smaller
than the other one

662
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:11,839
than the other one
 

663
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,990
than the other one
yeah then i picked the smaller one right

664
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
yeah then i picked the smaller one right
 

665
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,269
yeah then i picked the smaller one right
yeah so another one

666
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
yeah so another one
 

667
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,629
yeah so another one
uh let's put a result here with

668
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
uh let's put a result here with
 

669
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,829
uh let's put a result here with
results here then

670
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
results here then
 

671
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,030
results here then
result append

672
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040

bj right and you need to

678
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
bj right and you need to
 

679
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,910
bj right and you need to
plus equals one move the pointer to the

680
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
plus equals one move the pointer to the
 

681
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,230
plus equals one move the pointer to the
forward yeah move the smaller pointer to

682
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
forward yeah move the smaller pointer to
 

683
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,350
forward yeah move the smaller pointer to
to the bigger one okay and then what's

684
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
to the bigger one okay and then what's
 

685
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,470
to the bigger one okay and then what's
next

686
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,480
next
 

687
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,269
next
and then and what's that when we when

688
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
and then and what's that when we when
 

689
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,269
and then and what's that when we when
one reaches the end the other may not

690
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
one reaches the end the other may not
 

691
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:51,749
one reaches the end the other may not
finish

692
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
finish
 

693
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,310
finish
right so we need to compare the size if

694
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
right so we need to compare the size if
 

695
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,509
right so we need to compare the size if
i

696
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
i
 

697
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,550
i
smaller than aira then we

698
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
smaller than aira then we
 

699
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,470
smaller than aira then we
append we can plus equals

700
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
append we can plus equals
 

701
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,590
append we can plus equals
plus equals the next

702
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
plus equals the next
 

703
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,509
plus equals the next
yeah which is a

704
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
yeah which is a
 

705
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,710
yeah which is a
i it means from the current position to

706
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
i it means from the current position to
 

707
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,910
i it means from the current position to
the end

708
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
the end
 

709
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,749
the end
as i s plus equal b

710
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
as i s plus equal b
 

711
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,949
as i s plus equal b
j yeah and then return with desire

712
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
j yeah and then return with desire
 

713
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,069
j yeah and then return with desire
got it all right yeah

714
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
got it all right yeah
 

715
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,670
got it all right yeah
you see this is beautiful aquarium right

716
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
you see this is beautiful aquarium right
 

717
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,030
you see this is beautiful aquarium right
so the complexity is o and longer and

718
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
so the complexity is o and longer and
 

719
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,710
so the complexity is o and longer and
similar to quicksort remember we talked

720
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
similar to quicksort remember we talked
 

721
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,310
similar to quicksort remember we talked
about quick saw yesterday yeah

722
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
about quick saw yesterday yeah
 

723
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,949
about quick saw yesterday yeah
it's the similar complexity okay any

724
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
it's the similar complexity okay any
 

725
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,230
it's the similar complexity okay any
questions

726
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
questions
 

727
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:50,560
questions
okay so do you want to say goodbye
