am I right

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,420

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,420
some clothes on it okay

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,420
okay

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,640
I'll do it even better okay um

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,820
already

13
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,460
okay that one is running out so we can

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,640
just throw this away okay slowly in the

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,640
way

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,820
ah better

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:06,659
thank you for that

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,020
what's that huh my legs are not less

19
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,020
short

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,020
okay

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,720
do I have at least a big hands

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,740
okay that's it how can I have your pen

23
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,680
please why yeah because this one is good

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,180
okay so look there it is here let's say

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:43,079
Eric all right doesn't matter

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:45,720
so let's say I'm starting a petition one

27
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,820
why and then you are starting a

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,220
partition too okay it's too far for two

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,479
let's put two

30
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,899
two okay

31
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,579
and obviously say start star equals one

32
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,619
and it's one line okay it's one

33
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,600
dimensional Teddy will go left or right

34
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,700
only there's no other direction just

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,759
left or right and then right is here

36
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,720
right or Eric Ryan Eric okay just do it

37
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,660
right all around okay okay everyone

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,920
sounds cooler yeah all right

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,920
it's mixed together

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,560
listen listen

41
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,940
the question here

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,599
30 can only move left and right one step

43
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:46,319
okay is right that way yeah yeah because

44
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,480
yeah right left 30 can only move one

45
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,440
step at a time I can go right or I can

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,500
go left

47
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,160
so the question is how many ways if I

48
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,720
want to touch you let in exactly three

49
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,760
steps

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,120
okay I'll give you an example so one

51
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,739
yeah I go to the right one step is two

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,440
but that's not enough because I only

53
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,560
take you only take one step

54
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,900
good job okay so that's one

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
zero right

56
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,739
and then one

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,239
and then two how many steps one two

58
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:23,159
three three steps one two and

59
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,659
three

60
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:30,140
two this is also okay right also one

61
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,140
two

62
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,500
and go back one

63
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,959
two right so that's three ways

64
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,319
if I want to touch you

65
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,500
using three steps on the first one you

66
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,239
already touched good point okay let's go

67
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,580
find it okay we can cross it but not

68
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,519
touch it no the thing is

69
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,159
you can fly over you said so it's two

70
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,480
days and forward backwards so it's too

71
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,480
deep it's like a video game

72
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,040
okay okay I did not rephrase it

73
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,760
correctly okay so the question is that

74
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,560
how many ways that uh for Daddy to end

75
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:16,739
up the innocent Petition of Iran

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,380
exactly using exactly the case steps and

77
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:22,620
suppose that you can only move left or

78
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,600
right well if you can't do it good point

79
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,600
so can you imagine what what kind of

80
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,520
situation that we can do it forever for

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,699
that you can't touch that around well

82
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,160
yeah sorry

83
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:37,680
when Iran is like a hundred a hundred

84
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,680
yes exactly yes look there are a hundred

85
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,680
meter and then K is too small if Iran is

86
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,919
a hundred and eight three steps the best

87
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,460
you can reach is that one two three but

88
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,460
it's is

89
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,880
what

90
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,680
Star right

91
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,900
right okay but

92
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,340
on the left side so we need to do this

93
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,780
what's this

94
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,840
what's this

95
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,340
we talked about this absolute value ABS

96
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,479
remember

97
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,560
yeah

98
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,680
one

99
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,880
absolute x equals x when X bigger than

100
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,180
0.

101
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,340
equals zero when x equals zero minus X

102
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,280
when X is smaller than zero okay so it

103
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,720
basically is that distance

104
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,060
look

105
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,560
X is here x is -5 so minus five absolute

106
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,880
value is five it's basically the

107
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,699
distance

108
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,680
online to zero right

109
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,240
if it's on the left hand side for

110
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,960
example this is minus 10 what's the

111
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:57,120
distance what's the distance if uh if a

112
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,639
run is in minus 10 11 yes minus 10 minus

113
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,639
1 minus 11 right

114
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,100
but we are getting the distance so we do

115
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,639
this mathematically we do this we give

116
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,919
it a two vertical paths which means that

117
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,780
we want to get the absolute value and

118
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,240
for any negative

119
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,880
values the absolute value will be the

120
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,919
negative version of it okay

121
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,919
when we're done there's also another

122
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,039
situation that we can't reach in in k k

123
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:29,160
step I'll give you an example

124
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,440
okay so one two how about if I say k

125
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,259
equals two

126
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,020
can I ended up in Iran using two steps

127
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,479
if I'm at one that is one and you are

128
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,600
active you run at two and then I'm

129
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:45,479
saying in two steps can I no no why is

130
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,520
that because it's too small why is it

131
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,620
too soon no I can touch you but not in

132
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,139
two steps I can touch you in one step

133
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,440
but not two steps so what's what's the

134
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:58,319
problem here you can do two steps so if

135
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,840
you go to around once then you you have

136
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,759
you have enough stability so you are

137
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,919
because going back or

138
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,900
passed amen

139
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,819
yeah and what's the problem how can you

140
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,380
describe this kind of situation I mean

141
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,660
yeah I understand that you understand

142
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,160
this problem right right Eric do you

143
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,460
understand this

144
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,979
look I'm at one you are at two

145
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,340
the distance is you know

146
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:25,680
uh small right k equals two so I'm

147
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:30,539
asking can I touch you I cannot end it

148
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,979
up in two using two steps

149
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,560
why

150
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,030
because

151
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,120
um

152
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,639
[Music]

153
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,280
are you all right yeah okay too heavy

154
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,960
yeah yeah okay so what's what's the

155
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,259
problem

156
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,060
um what's the problem

157
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,560
yeah yeah I know but I'm saying what's

158
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,319
the problem on that

159
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,139
it's possible yeah it's impossible but

160
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:00,419
why it's possible I said it's possible

161
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:02,880
huh look

162
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,099
what did you do

163
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,440
I think that's the only difference a

164
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,720
three okay okay

165
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,900
I know you understand it but you won't

166
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,080
try give yourself is it like um because

167
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:20,160
the difference between is one that's

168
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:24,960
right the difference is one okay and and

169
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,240
so for two you can okay equals two okay

170
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,080
so you can um

171
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,730
so you can go to it around but you also

172
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,219
like

173
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:37,979
[Music]

174
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:40,140
so what's that thing what's that thing

175
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,740
okay so I give you another example how

176
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:47,720
about t equals one and K

177
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,720
equals equals five can we do it

178
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,519
um yes okay how about

179
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,740
it B has to be odd number right how

180
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,959
about if T equals 2 and k equals three

181
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,300
can we do it

182
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:10,200
all right okay how about Key T equals

183
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,860
four and k equals I don't know eight can

184
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,660
we do it no yeah yeah yeah let's just

185
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,300
look at the without checking the

186
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,680
distance without checking this okay I'm

187
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,800
not talking about this I'm talking about

188
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,560
it but you're right so if T is the odd

189
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,779
number the K has to be odd number if T

190
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,300
is an even number okay it has to be an

191
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:35,040
even number right all right in order for

192
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:37,680
for 30 to end up in Iran right okay

193
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,160
we'll get it

194
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,680
okay now that's good so we we know these

195
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,440
two conditions to check okay so now

196
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,740
think about it how do we

197
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,260
how do we calculate the number of ways

198
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,660
how do we calculate the number of ways I

199
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,820
need to give the how do we calculate the

200
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,959
number away I mean it's hard right but

201
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,779
think about it how many Choice do I have

202
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,760
you okay one step I'm one step two

203
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,580
obviously okay that's a good stuff I

204
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,580
think we have two steps left or right so

205
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:15,240
let's say if I have a function called f

206
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,640
star and then I've end and I need to do

207
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,560
the case step this retains the number of

208
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:24,180
ways

209
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:27,720
for Daddy a star to end up in N with K

210
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,779
step all right so but you say method it

211
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,380
has two ways so the next one will be

212
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:37,140
F star I can go to the left right which

213
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,779
is star minus one right and then n and

214
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:43,019
how many steps I need to make I make one

215
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:45,959
step how many steps I need to make

216
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,720
um it came on the front that's fine and

217
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:50,459
another way to the right so F star to

218
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,440
the right

219
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:55,200
okay an end

220
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,660
K minus one right they're only two ways

221
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,940
so we need just need to plus together

222
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,000
right with this condition we need to

223
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,260
check be fine if the ABS

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,120
star

225
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,600
minus n

226
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,000
is bigger than K and we turn zero right

227
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,240
there's no way to do it

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,140
all right I take it at the distance if D

229
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:24,240
is bigger than k

230
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:27,720
if K is zero yes so now if K is is zero

231
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,019
so what happening no no okay the K step

232
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,760
so what means yeah I can move so what do

233
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,399
I need to do

234
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,519
if I have a picture with you then I will

235
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,740
turn zero if I'm just stand on your spot

236
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,920
then return one am I right because I

237
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,720
already ended up in your petition if

238
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,600
star

239
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,300
equal n then in this case would return

240
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,300
one otherwise will return zero all right

241
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,300
yeah

242
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,360
daddy can't move

243
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,399
right but in this case

244
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,160
if I'm already in your position then

245
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,079
return one because that counts as a one

246
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,519
way am I right I don't need to move it's

247
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,200
still 100 because I'm already in your

248
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,380
position otherwise it will turn zero

249
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,779
makes sense do you mean you're the

250
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,839
person

251
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:21,480
can be in the same spot as you yeah this

252
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,779
is the corner case all right because

253
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,399
you're given to style and I can be in

254
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,680
your spot

255
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,440
and if K is zero and I don't need to

256
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:35,399
move that counts as one solution

257
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,779
okay otherwise otherwise return

258
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:42,740
f

259
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:47,720
star minus one n k minus 1 plus F Star

260
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:49,740
Plus One n k minus one okay

261
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,560
so look

262
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,540
this is what we talk about right yes we

263
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,760
can move to the left or we can move to

264
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,040
the right and the answer will be

265
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,519
the sum of those

266
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,260
I was missing you okay cash yes it's

267
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,540
cash we need to remember the stage right

268
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,339
if we don't remember the state it will

269
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,720
be

270
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,779
the time convincible being for

271
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,540
explanation why is that look look let's

272
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:17,459
start n and then every time there are

273
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,839
two branches coming off going to the

274
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,220
left going to the right going to the

275
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,920
left or to the right that would be

276
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,079
duplications here for example if this

277
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,600
style is calculated here and then you

278
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:29,880
might need it here again now if we don't

279
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,380
store this value what happened we if we

280
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,680
spend like 10 minutes

281
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,660
calculating this picture and then it

282
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,639
means that we have to do this again and

283
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,800
that's at least the better things add up

284
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,260
to the time complexity which is the

285
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,420
exponential but if we put a cache it

286
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:51,360
means that well remember we're

287
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:53,760
remembering any state of time star and K

288
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,760
the end is not actually not moving right

289
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,380
look these three parameters which one is

290
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:05,240
changing which one is not I just said

291
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,240
is changing which one is not okay

292
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:18,120
you just stand there so this is top down

293
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,540
dynamic programming without this cash is

294
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,880
you know profiles simulation proofers

295
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,920
because we are just simulating going to

296
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,440
the left going to the right but with the

297
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,180
cash this magic key was making a

298
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,260
top-down anime programming because we

299
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,360
are remembering each step star times k

300
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,820
the star could be many right it could be

301
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,519
many but we are limiting it we are

302
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,079
improving by checking this if the

303
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,540
distance is bigger than 10 we just

304
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:48,839
return zero if the distance between 30

305
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,519
and around is more than K it means that

306
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,339
there's no way

307
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,980
to catch it right for Daddy to catch

308
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,959
Iran there's one thing missing we'll

309
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,240
talk about a lot and even right we need

310
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:06,180
to put it here as well which is look if

311
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:10,800
T is N1

312
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:13,560
is equal to K is not equals to K and one

313
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,740
then returns zero right we talk about

314
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,860
that this is very important if K is an

315
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:24,720
odd number D distance is an even number

316
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:27,380
or if K is the even number P is a odd

317
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:32,760
number then there's no way to end it up

318
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:37,579
in end exactly using K step okay so this

319
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,579
is but we can do it mathematic

320
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,540
turning to the left turning turning to

321
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,800
the right all right

322
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:50,760
so if I'm saying that it takes Daddy

323
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,480
needs to turn them using air step

324
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:57,240
L to the left 30 needs to go to the

325
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,519
right using R step what's the value L

326
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,500
plus r

327
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,360
okay all right

328
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,459
because I need to

329
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,760
spend three steps

330
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:11,220
and air step to the left after to the

331
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,720
right A plus I equals K what's the

332
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,399
second thing

333
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,399
look

334
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,279
here star here's n

335
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,260
so here

336
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:24,600
to the left

337
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:27,300
R to the right

338
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,740
to the right right look R to the right

339
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:36,360
minus L to the left equals one

340
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:39,180
ah minus L equals one look the distance

341
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,620
here this is distance

342
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,620
I'm here

343
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:47,579
I go to the right

344
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:50,699
I go to the right after

345
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:52,800
I go to the left air step

346
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:58,339
what's R minus there on this picture

347
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:01,980
what's R minus l in this picture d d

348
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:03,360
okay we have this equation can we solve

349
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,959
it

350
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,780
L plus R equals k r minus a equals T can

351
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,040
we solve it we talk about this in early

352
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,620
days

353
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,520
um two hours yeah we ended up together

354
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,780
look

355
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:21,780
L plus r plus r minus L right this bit

356
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:27,360
equals a plus d

357
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:29,160
this comes out 2 times R equals K plus t

358
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,640
I equals this

359
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:36,539
divided by two this is known this is

360
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,539
known this is known so ah no one

361
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:42,980
okay so what is this useful they are K

362
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:46,620
step I need to make a step

363
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:49,320
and R step to the right the case step

364
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,320
and I need to pick our step to go to the

365
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,600
right what was that layer take apples

366
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,840
layer K apples

367
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,400
I need to pick our apples to eat there

368
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,640
are three apples I need to pick two

369
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,880
apples they are combination yeah they

370
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,039
are K apples I need to pick our apples

371
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:13,260
to eat when I eat an apple I go to the

372
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:18,120
right yes so the answer is c k

373
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:21,419
ah which is K plus C divided by two

374
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,919
This Is The Answer amazing right so we

375
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,660
talk about you know with I don't want to

376
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,280
repeat last lesson we talked about three

377
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,760
ways to calculating the combination

378
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:32,100
number in Python we have this

379
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,580
from Mass

380
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,620
import we can import com which is

381
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:43,500
combination.com

382
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:48,179
k k plus d divided divided by 2 or shift

383
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,740
Shifty one which is also Okay so

384
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,840
one last question

385
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,520
what's the problem and what have you

386
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,919
learned come on just give me a two

387
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,840
sentence to summarize what have we

388
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,460
learned today

389
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,120
so then

390
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,160
two guys two guys yes are you sure it's

391
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,900
two guys not two girls or one boy one

392
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,100
girl

393
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,100
two humans okay

394
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:18,020
and one of them and we start

395
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:22,080
is uh trying to get to the end with

396
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:23,640
Cambridge yeah exactly okay move okay

397
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,620
Okay so

398
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,220
that's the problem and how do we solve

399
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,020
it

400
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,500
how many ways we solve it man what's the

401
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,500
conditions

402
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,480
what's the condition that the the answer

403
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,400
should be zero there's no way impossible

404
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,580
what kind of scenarios that we need to

405
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,140
say okay don't try to move because it's

406
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,299
impossible to

407
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,679
hi Jeffrey

408
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:51,120
um

409
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:56,940
um when K is our own number and

410
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:59,179
and the D is it even number or okay even

411
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,160
number and

412
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:03,080
oh

413
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,679
plan

414
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,679
and where

415
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:14,100
um

416
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:17,520
with with with the diff D is

417
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,900
uh bigger than

418
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,880
k

419
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:25,440
yeah because okay because it's too far

420
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:28,140
if K is 3 and D is a hundred right

421
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,419
so the best thing I can do is just to

422
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,120
move three to the right one which still

423
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:35,280
makes 97 distance right so that's one

424
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,640
thing okay Ryan what have you learned

425
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,600
about about humans trying to get to each

426
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:46,080
other okay but uh you do you understand

427
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,820
these yeah yeah okay okay and also

428
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,700
there's another way which is bottle up

429
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,640
because we you know these from this uh

430
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:57,000
dynamic programming right star minus

431
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,700
what we can use the d k which is the

432
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,200
step and then the distance right we can

433
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,200
use a distance which is let's say DP k d

434
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:13,799
the number of ways to reach

435
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,980
the distance t

436
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,780
using K step and then it's based on BP

437
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:23,340
okay

438
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,840
minus one and then t plus 1 and K minus

439
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,380
one

440
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,120
B minus 1 right once one to the left one

441
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,159
to the right we can solve this using the

442
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:37,620
bottom of dynamic programming okay and

443
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:39,600
because dpk is based on dpk minus one so

444
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,120
it's more like a pascal triangle right

445
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,760
but it's a little bit different because

446
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,320
it's two numbers about the shooter so

447
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,780
it'll be something like you know two

448
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,880
three and then there's a zero and then

449
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:54,179
right and then that will be the five

450
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,539
something like that so dpk will be the

451
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:59,400
sum of the dpk minus one D minus one DBK

452
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:03,000
minus one K plus one okay so we're not

453
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,039
going to dip into these uh because uh to

454
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,620
implement this bottom up is non-trivial

455
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,140
like the combination the Pascal triangle

456
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:12,299
remember the the values equals the sum

457
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,580
of two numbers above it and if we're

458
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:17,340
implementing using the butter up

459
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,200
approach it's non-trivial and we can

460
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,880
make mistakes when implementing such

461
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,980
things because there are lots of details

462
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,620
to consider especially when handling the

463
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,559
boundary it's better we use this uh

464
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,840
cache right cash

465
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:33,720
let the computer handle the recursion

466
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,340
and the boundary educated or we can use

467
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,940
this but the most important thing today

468
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:41,159
is this and we want to pick the K plus 3

469
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,960
divided by two step to the right there

470
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,360
are characters we want to pick at least

471
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,640
a number of apples to eat

472
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:53,240
when we eat after we go to the right

473
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,240
okay that's it for today bye-bye bye bye
