1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,680
hello mistery mr runner all right

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,160
okay so let's say we have a finally tree

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,480
yeah finally what's finally what's to

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,120
find and what's three is it basically

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,880
three obviously

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,560
okay so what's

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,840
what's the difference between a by a

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,560
tree

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,560
and a graph

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,920
three is a girl that's

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,199
excellent three is a graph the graph is

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,039
not necessarily a trick right so three

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,920
for three you know it doesn't have

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,600
cycles right and then what else

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,440
it's

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,480
it's also

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,960
what

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,320
directly a cyclical

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,800
be connected well if it's different than

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,320
what we call it like forest okay if we

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,559
both of these

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,600
if each of these is a tree then we call

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,800
it a forest okay forest lots of trees

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,239
yeah

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,160
okay so no cycles a cyclic locker no

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:05,040
cycles and each node has only one parent

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,520
directive okay each each node has only

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,600
one parent and the one which does not

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,280
have parent we call it

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,119
what's this we call it one and one have

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,759
more than one route

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,680
yeah yeah yeah excellent yes and we the

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,000
ones we love the kids we call it

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,200
what do we call it what are these nuts

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,280
four five six seven leaves leaves yeah

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,560
it's actually like upside down too yeah

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,799
if you're looking from the upside down

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,759
that's the rule that's the branch

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
always uh koi trunk trunk

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,320
and the

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,240
leaf

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,280
and finally the three is basically like

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,079
uh each note can have at most two kids

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,159
okay left and right okay so today is the

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,320
question very easy

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,040
so we have uh

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,920
a balance tree and you know the biology

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,710
usually you have this node and then the

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,119
node that will have this value

50
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,759
[Music]

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,240
and we have this left and we have this

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,280
right pointer so now we're going to add

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,239
one more field which called next

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,040
so initially the next pointer will be

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,720
all initialized to noun and then

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,239
we want you to

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,959
populate the binary so that each node

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,360
points to the next the next

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,800
point to the one on the third level yeah

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,040
so basically i

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,520
we want you to

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,959
add one more link yeah

63
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
that's it

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,200
you get my point

65
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,319
yes do you get my point

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,959
so we want

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,080
to point the note to the next on the

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,519
right

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
on the same level

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,360
yeah so basically look this is left and

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,680
right yeah left and right but we want to

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,239
add one more next which is initialized

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,239
to be nine but we want to point to the

74
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,640
the one on the right okay

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,720
so the root does nothing

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,120
exactly okay because it does not have

77
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,000
any notes on the right of the root right

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,280
yeah

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,159
so when we okay so does it remind you

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,319
something look the same thing the note

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,159
on the right on the same level okay so

82
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,440
what's hint is that same level

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,159
so

84
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,760
well done breakfast easy so probably we

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,440
can do this definitely but perfect

86
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,480
search is the way to go right it's very

87
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,080
obvious so we just reference search

88
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,319
and then

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,000
by taking because look the breakfast

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,159
search actually we can implement in two

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,680
ways one way is that every time yeah

92
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,400
look this one two three four five six

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,519
seven eight nine okay so we have a queue

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,440
dq double ndq yeah okay so how do we do

95
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,319
this first of all we put the note in

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,319
yeah

97
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,519
look one

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,319
okay

99
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,879
that's the initial state okay

100
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,280
i take one out i take everything out

101
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,840
from the queue because that's the all

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,920
the notes in the skew is the same level

103
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,439
only one note on the first level and i

104
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,120
push it keep

105
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,760
it's a kid

106
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,680
i take one out yeah

107
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,959
what's that no what's the children of a

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,640
two and three of one two three yeah okay

109
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,519
i'm gonna put it in yeah two and three

110
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,280
in q

111
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
okay so now look

112
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
all the notes in the queue

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,280
two and three there are two ways one way

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,280
one way of pressure searches i can take

115
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,520
it one note at a time so i take the two

116
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,400
out and then push the kids is full and

117
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,240
fine all i can take the other way is i

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,440
can take two and three oh at the same

119
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,040
time and push each kid because i know if

120
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,840
if i do it this way i know at any time

121
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
all the notes all the notes in the queue

122
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,320
belongs to the center look two and three

123
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,840
the number yeah so how about that i take

124
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,040
a two out two and three out you know dq

125
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,600
take it out

126
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,520
first in cersei what's the children of

127
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,960
two four one

128
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,560
four and five what's the children of

129
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,080
three

130
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,520
you see look now four five six seven

131
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,240
what are these notes in common

132
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,120
we're done okay so now i do the same i

133
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,680
take four five six seven out and i push

134
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,160
their kids which is eight and nine right

135
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,960
so i take these out everything go out

136
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,120
here like four five six and i put a and

137
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,960
nine look a and nine the same the same

138
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,039
level yeah so

139
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,800
if we do it this way we can make sure

140
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,960
all the notes in the queue belong to the

141
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,880
same level why do we need that because

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,039
if we know that all the nodes in the

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,919
same level then i can point

144
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,320
this node to the one on the on the next

145
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,280
we want to put the node put three screen

146
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,440
next

147
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,759
we're going to put the node next to the

148
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,560
one on the right okay

149
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,479
so we want to add one more link

150
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,360
from the note

151
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,600
and to the one on the left on the right

152
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,560
okay so we'll put the formula to a five

153
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,479
five to the six six to seven right okay

154
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,000
now we can do this question search how

155
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,199
do we implement a preference search

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,880
usually

157
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,880
you know this question

158
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,240
how do we implement a process search uh

159
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,039
key and in python we can use the

160
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,039
dq double

161
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,600
breath

162
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,800
means white yeah yeah as opposed to

163
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
death

164
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,720
depth okay

165
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,600
this is different okay breasts

166
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,600
that okay

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,560
okay

168
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,479
okay okay

169
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,120
okay now let's implement this square for

170
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,960
search okay breakfast breakfast okay

171
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,000
okay let's see that's it that's it

172
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,560
define

173
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,880
let's say populate right pop right okay

174
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,880
popular right

175
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,720
popular right okay and i'm given this

176
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,039
blue node

177
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,440
okay so q equals dq

178
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,199
the amount is of using dq as opposed to

179
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,840
at least you know we can in python we

180
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,240
can use the list to implement a queue

181
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,280
right first thing first off right but if

182
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,240
you go for this approach the amount

183
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,560
the disadvantage of using that is as a q

184
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,520
is because that but the operation when

185
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,240
we do this q probe zero this is linear

186
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:21,120
time okay as opposed to the q the top

187
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,160
left which is constant okay dq and root

188
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,520
so

189
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,479
as the normal preference such while q

190
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,800
and we check n is length q this is the

191
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,720
number of nodes in the currency belongs

192
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,319
to the same level and then we can do

193
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,680
this four

194
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,039
or four

195
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,840
and go in range

196
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,720
and now we do this current

197
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,000
q dot one if we want to take a note

198
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,560
from the queue

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,520
first thing first of all what method

200
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,840
is this q dot one

201
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,080
power left pop left here left

202
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,560
if we don't specify left right then

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,160
you'll be the right yeah

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,240
yeah yeah

205
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,560
a pen a pen left look q dot pop

206
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,039
without the left is right

207
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,199
q dot append with down the left is right

208
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,680
okay if we don't say which way it by

209
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,759
default on the right hand side okay

210
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,520
okay and then we have to do this

211
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,360
look at this is the number of notes in

212
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,800
the curve in the queue yeah in the queue

213
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,720
like one uh two three okay n is two two

214
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,120
notes okay and then we go through each

215
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,599
note then we pop it we take a two out

216
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,839
and we have to check if current the left

217
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,320
then we push it back we append it to

218
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,839
append the left kick to the to the back

219
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,080
to the queue so cue the

220
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,920
append karen does that i understand

221
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:49,200
what's next is if what can you guess if

222
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,360
ewa turn the right is calling the right

223
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,920
and then what

224
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,920
a pen what

225
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,800
and now

226
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,880
look we just pop it and then if look

227
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,040
a tiny and then the next the most

228
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,680
important thing now is to link it to add

229
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,839
this link so add this link right

230
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,440
how many notes we need to link we need

231
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,760
to add a link

232
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,570
four five six seven which nose needs to

233
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,839
be adding a link

234
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,000
[Music]

235
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,040
yeah how many links

236
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,040
okay so

237
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,680
which link which note does not need to

238
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,680
add a link

239
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,600
yeah yeah yeah yeah but but i mean the

240
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,120
same level which note does not have to

241
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
be as a link

242
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
let's take a look at the notes on the

243
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,480
side all right far right the one on the

244
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,640
right is no because the points do

245
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,000
nothing right exactly so then we have to

246
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,839
check

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,959
yeah

248
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,480
okay so okay so we have to okay so let's

249
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,760
we have to use this index for i yeah so

250
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
if i

251
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,560
not equals n minus one because if it's n

252
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,640
minus one it's a instant white on the

253
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,120
right right then we have to pop it we

254
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:06,000
have to we have to link it so

255
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:08,320
so what current dot next e chord q zlo

256
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,320
this is the thing today because all the

257
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,680
rest is processors can you explain to me

258
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,240
what if i

259
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,079
when when is the case when i is n minus

260
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,240
one

261
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,519
if i not equals n minus 1 what does it

262
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,079
mean

263
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,600
if i it means i if i doesn't

264
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,040
it means

265
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,640
if i not equal

266
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:34,079
what if i i is n minus 1 what's it what

267
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,880
does it mean it means if it doesn't

268
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,959
point to anything okay so if i is n

269
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,160
minus one it means the what the note is

270
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,760
on the far on the right right so if it's

271
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
not on the right

272
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,880
yeah if i write then we can point

273
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,640
current the next original points to q

274
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,600
zero what's q zero can you tell me

275
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,959
what's q zero what's q zero mean

276
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,560
q this is the q q zero is what the

277
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,959
okay so this is the q

278
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,680
one two three there's three notes in the

279
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,760
queue so q0 where is it

280
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,440
which one is q0

281
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,279
yeah so it's the front of the queue

282
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,440
right this is the q first thing first

283
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,880
off you go in here you take it out here

284
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,279
q0 is the front of q so here look if we

285
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,240
are here q zero because we already

286
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,959
taking top left we take the four out so

287
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,920
the q zero will be five right

288
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,720
for if i'm visiting a five q zero will

289
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,120
be six so what this means is that i'm

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,279
current i point to the next

291
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,600
pointer to the right okay

292
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,720
except the last one is at the node on

293
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,440
the far

294
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,320
far right right yeah

295
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,399
so this is the thing all the rest is

296
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
reference search the time complexity of

297
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,440
n n is the number of nodes in the binary

298
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,680
tree okay let's face complexity o n

299
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,959
because we are using the dq

300
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,040
got it

301
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,279
okay to sum up what have you learned

302
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,800
today come on

303
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,040
follow me

304
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,959
yeah no no what have you learned today

305
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,000
you need to explain to me in one

306
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,720
sentence not in one word or two words

307
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,480
okay so what we have learned today what

308
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
what's the problem

309
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,519
and

310
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,760
what are we trying to solve today and

311
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,639
what kind of approach are we using

312
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,920
taking we're using breakfast yeah we're

313
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,399
using

314
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,720
to do what software kind of program

315
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,720
come on

316
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,680
don't give me a few words i want a

317
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,800
sentence a whole sentence so okay we got

318
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,320
you

319
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,399
what's the problem first of all what's

320
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,760
the problem the problem

321
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,920
is i have hiccups

322
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,399
sorry what's that we have a tree

323
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,279
obviously we have a banner tree yes and

324
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,560
then we're supposed to

325
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,360
buy the next number yeah in the level

326
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,720
the same level okay so we try to write

327
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,880
we we try to add the link to the right

328
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,959
on the set on the note on the same level

329
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,600
okay and what's the approach we're

330
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,760
taking to solve this what's the approach

331
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,360
graphics search and i'm implementing

332
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,600
using a queue okay so two okay i'll give

333
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,360
you an example yeah next time i ask you

334
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,079
this question you can answer it right

335
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,959
now okay so today the problem is that we

336
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,480
are given a binary tree and we want to

337
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,079
add a link

338
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,200
for any node

339
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,040
yeah

340
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,360
any node or in the binary to the one

341
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,360
to the to its neighbor on the right in

342
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,399
the same level okay an approach we're

343
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,399
taking today

344
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,920
is breakfast search because the

345
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,040
preference search

346
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,920
is

347
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,040
used normally to do this level by level

348
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,639
traversal

349
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,560
and when doing this level by level

350
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,120
transfer we add a link here except the

351
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,680
last one that's not on the far right

352
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,880
right because it does not point to any

353
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,560
neighbor on the right there's no

354
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,600
neighbors on the right

355
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,639
and right

356
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,040
yeah got it yeah that's it for today

357
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,040
thank you bye
