00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
mr ryan how are you today good remember
 

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:06,789
mr ryan how are you today good remember
this

6
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799
this
 

7
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,910
this
this is the recursive implementation of

8
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:09,920
this is the recursive implementation of
 

9
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,509
this is the recursive implementation of
how we getting these the

10
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
how we getting these the
 

11
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,270
how we getting these the
computer math depth of a binary tree

12
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,280
computer math depth of a binary tree
 

13
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,830
computer math depth of a binary tree
which is the distance between the root

14
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
which is the distance between the root
 

15
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,950
which is the distance between the root
and uh

16
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
and uh
 

17
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,790
and uh
and the leaf yeah so today we are going

18
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
and the leaf yeah so today we are going
 

19
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,790
and the leaf yeah so today we are going
to use another algorithm

20
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
to use another algorithm
 

21
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,349
to use another algorithm
breakfast search but for ourselves tell

22
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,359
breakfast search but for ourselves tell
 

23
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,710
breakfast search but for ourselves tell
me what's happening

24
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:26,720
me what's happening
 

25
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:43,350
me what's happening
yeah let me let's breakfast

26
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360

 

27
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,549

means horizontal yeah

28
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
means horizontal yeah
 

29
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,869
means horizontal yeah
dfs yeah we talk about this

30
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879

 

31
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,069

death okay compared to this depth

32
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
death okay compared to this depth
 

33
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,950
death okay compared to this depth
so one is horizontal the other one is

34
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
so one is horizontal the other one is
 

35
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,630
so one is horizontal the other one is
that vertical

36
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
that vertical
 

37
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,270
that vertical
deep okay yeah deep yeah basically

38
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
deep okay yeah deep yeah basically
 

39
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,950
deep okay yeah deep yeah basically
deeper is the

40
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
deeper is the
 

41
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,310
deeper is the
adjective and this is the norm yeah

42
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
adjective and this is the norm yeah
 

43
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,350
adjective and this is the norm yeah
yeah this is a dj yeah

44
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
yeah this is a dj yeah
 

45
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,350
yeah this is a dj yeah
yeah big bad

46
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360

 

47
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,390

um okay so basically

48
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
um okay so basically
 

49
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,070
um okay so basically
we we visit we visit the notes

50
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
we we visit we visit the notes
 

51
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,030
we we visit we visit the notes
in the horizontal order so look can you

52
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
in the horizontal order so look can you
 

53
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,510
in the horizontal order so look can you
tell me

54
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
tell me
 

55
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,390
tell me
what this is how we pushing this to the

56
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
what this is how we pushing this to the
 

57
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,190
what this is how we pushing this to the
tree

58
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
tree
 

59
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,630
tree
uh how we visit it

60
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640

 

61
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,910

okay can you tell me

okay can you tell me
 

63
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,030
okay can you tell me
how we how we how we use the preference

64
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
how we how we how we use the preference
 

65
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,149
how we how we how we use the preference

the order of the notes yeah
 

69
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,389
the order of the notes yeah
one two three four five exactly and then

70
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
one two three four five exactly and then
 

71
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,350

00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,230
two three three four five
it's the same yeah yeah it's about

78
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
it's the same yeah yeah it's about
 

79

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
of logics yeah
 

83
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,709
of logics yeah
it just happens to be the same if i put

84
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
it just happens to be the same if i put
 

85
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,510
it just happens to be the same if i put

simply one two three six four five yeah
level by little but that's one third it

94
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
level by little but that's one third it
 

95
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,830
level by little but that's one third it
will be one

96
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
will be one

two six three four five
 

99
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,270
two six three four five
got it yeah okay so in order to do this

100
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
got it yeah okay so in order to do this
 

101
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,030
got it yeah okay so in order to do this
uh what kind of data structure are we

102
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
uh what kind of data structure are we
 

103
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,390
uh what kind of data structure are we
using

104
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
using
 

105
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,589
using
are we using eric we talk about data

106
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
are we using eric we talk about data
 

107
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,510
are we using eric we talk about data
structure when we talk about a breakfast

108
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
structure when we talk about a breakfast
 

109
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,150
structure when we talk about a breakfast
search

110
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
search
 

111
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,869
search
we usually use the data structure which

112
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
we usually use the data structure which
 

113
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,070
we usually use the data structure which
is

114
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
is
 

115
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,350
is
yes and why is that a kill yeah well

116
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
yes and why is that a kill yeah well
 

117
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,350
yes and why is that a kill yeah well
done first thing first out okay

thing
 

127
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:59,110
thing
what is that

128
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120

 

129
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,430

okay so so look we have a basic

130
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
okay so so look we have a basic
 

131
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,670
okay so so look we have a basic
framework to do a preference search can

132
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
framework to do a preference search can
 

133
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,589
framework to do a preference search can
you can come out please

134
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599

 

135
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,830

define max

136
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
define max
 

137
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:31,030
define max
that's that i don't call it

138
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040

 

139
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,229

because it's not nothing nothing is zero

140
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239

 

141
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,670

zero zero depth okay now we we create a

142
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
zero zero depth okay now we we create a
 

143
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,710
zero zero depth okay now we we create a
q in python we can use the double ndq

144
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
q in python we can use the double ndq
 

145
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,550
q in python we can use the double ndq
okay so look

146
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
okay so look
 

147
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,430
okay so look
q

148
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440

 

149
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,949

and then bracket and then we need to

150
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
and then bracket and then we need to
 

151
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,830
and then bracket and then we need to
push the first first note which is what

152
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
push the first first note which is what
 

153
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,589
push the first first note which is what
we need to push the first note which is

154
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
we need to push the first note which is
 

155
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,990
we need to push the first note which is
right look but we also need to push

156
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
right look but we also need to push
 

157
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,949
right look but we also need to push
these steps so we put this bracket yeah

158
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
these steps so we put this bracket yeah
 

159
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,110
these steps so we put this bracket yeah
at least yeah and then we do this two

160
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
at least yeah and then we do this two
 

161
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,149
at least yeah and then we do this two
parts yeah super

162
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
parts yeah super
 

163
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,990
parts yeah super
loot and then one okay because the loot

164
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
loot and then one okay because the loot
 

165
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,589
loot and then one okay because the loot
has the number one right

166
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
has the number one right
 

167
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,429
has the number one right
cute yeah like that

168
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
cute yeah like that
 

169
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,429
cute yeah like that
okay then we also need to store the

170
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
okay then we also need to store the
 

171
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,629
okay then we also need to store the
maximum

172
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
maximum
 

173
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,629
maximum
uh depth in in in

174
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
uh depth in in in
 

175
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,629
uh depth in in in
in a variable we call it answer right

176
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
in a variable we call it answer right
 

177
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,070
in a variable we call it answer right
answer equals zero

178
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
answer equals zero
 

179
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,350
answer equals zero
yeah so while the q is not empty

180
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
yeah so while the q is not empty
 

181
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,990
yeah so while the q is not empty
yeah while the queue is not empty why

182
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
yeah while the queue is not empty why
 

183
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,909
yeah while the queue is not empty why
huh

184
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
huh
 

185
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,749
huh
wire not empty queue how do we check the

186
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
wire not empty queue how do we check the
 

187
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,110
wire not empty queue how do we check the
queue if it's not empty

188
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
queue if it's not empty
 

189
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,110
queue if it's not empty
away file length lens yeah because lens

190
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
away file length lens yeah because lens
 

191
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,990
away file length lens yeah because lens
q we can use the length length q if it's

192
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
q we can use the length length q if it's
 

193
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,189
q we can use the length length q if it's
not empty which is

194
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
not empty which is
 

195
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,990
not empty which is
what that's in the wrong place

196
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
what that's in the wrong place
 

197
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,070
what that's in the wrong place
what bigger than zero yeah that's in the

198
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
what bigger than zero yeah that's in the
 

199
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,350
what bigger than zero yeah that's in the
wrong place to be here

200
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
wrong place to be here
 

201
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,950
wrong place to be here
that's okay that's always the same yeah

202
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
that's okay that's always the same yeah
 

203
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,469
that's okay that's always the same yeah
that's okay sit down sit down please

205
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,550

and then how we can pop it we can we

206
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
and then how we can pop it we can we
 

207
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,310
and then how we can pop it we can we
need to remove it from the head of the

208
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
need to remove it from the head of the
 

209
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,390
need to remove it from the head of the
queue which you will use the best called

210
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
queue which you will use the best called
 

211
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,150
queue which you will use the best called
pop work pop which side we

212
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
pop work pop which side we
 

213
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,150
pop work pop which side we
it's a q we push it and we're going to

214
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
it's a q we push it and we're going to
 

215
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,749
it's a q we push it and we're going to
put pull it from

216
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
put pull it from
 

217
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,390
put pull it from
left yeah so so carbon we can assign it

218
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
left yeah so so carbon we can assign it
 

219
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,990
left yeah so so carbon we can assign it
to a common node and then the

220
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
to a common node and then the
 

221
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,629
to a common node and then the
second node is f yeah because it's two

222
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
second node is f yeah because it's two
 

223
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,830
second node is f yeah because it's two
parts right

224
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840
parts right
 

225
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:32,240

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,350
top left okay now we have the test
we know we are visiting the node then we

232
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
we know we are visiting the node then we
 

233
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,550
we know we are visiting the node then we
need to update the

234
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
need to update the
 

235
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,749
need to update the
uh uh answer so answer

245
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,870

depth because we are getting these steps

246
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
depth because we are getting these steps
 

247
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,990
depth because we are getting these steps
value okay

248
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
value okay
 

249
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,629

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
if death if death is bigger than
 

257
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,629
if death if death is bigger than
answer then answer equal steps right all

258
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
answer then answer equal steps right all
 

259
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,430

yeah erin pay attention please yeah
ryan i'm going to test you later okay if

264
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
ryan i'm going to test you later okay if
 

265
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,430
ryan i'm going to test you later okay if
you're not listening okay

you're not listening okay
 

267
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,950
you're not listening okay
yeah now we got a current note

268
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
yeah now we got a current note
 

269
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,510
yeah now we got a current note
we need to push it that kid or right kid

270
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
we need to push it that kid or right kid
 

271
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,950
we need to push it that kid or right kid
into the queue right

272
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
into the queue right
 

273
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,990
into the queue right
yes only if it's not empty right if it's

274
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
yes only if it's not empty right if it's
 

275
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,189
yes only if it's not empty right if it's
empty we just skip

276
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
empty we just skip
 

277
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,950
empty we just skip
okay so how can we do this

278
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
okay so how can we do this
 

279
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,629
okay so how can we do this
how can we push it how can we push it

280
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
how can we push it how can we push it
 

281
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,870
how can we push it how can we push it
remember the breakfast search usually we

282
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
remember the breakfast search usually we
 

283
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,309
remember the breakfast search usually we
take a taylor

284
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
take a taylor
 

285
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,870
take a taylor
note from the queue and then we push

286
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
note from the queue and then we push
 

287
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,550
note from the queue and then we push
push its kids okay so

288
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
push its kids okay so
 

289
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,909
push its kids okay so
i buy one okay if current got

290
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
i buy one okay if current got
 

291
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,469
i buy one okay if current got
left yeah you cut on the left then

292
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
left yeah you cut on the left then
 

293
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,230
left yeah you cut on the left then
q dot append yeah open to the right yeah

294
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
q dot append yeah open to the right yeah
 

295
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:11,990
q dot append yeah open to the right yeah
open what

296
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000

 

297
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,589

so in order to do that we need to push

298
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
so in order to do that we need to push
 

299
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,870
so in order to do that we need to push
current dot left and comma what

i'm
 

327
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,629
i'm
this is the loop one and then i'm

328
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
this is the loop one and then i'm
 

329
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,510
this is the loop one and then i'm
pushing this so what's the depth of this

so which means that i can push i can

390
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
so which means that i can push i can
 

391
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,630
so which means that i can push i can
up top left and i can pop and i can

392
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
up top left and i can pop and i can
 

393
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,509
up top left and i can pop and i can
append

394
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
append
 

395
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,150
append
left and i also can prepare so basically

396
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
left and i also can prepare so basically
 

397
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,910
left and i also can prepare so basically
it's a cue like you can do this

398
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
it's a cue like you can do this
 

399
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,870
it's a cue like you can do this
operation

400
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
operation
 

401
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,310
operation
push a pen and pop from both sides yeah

402
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
push a pen and pop from both sides yeah
 

403
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,310
push a pen and pop from both sides yeah
so it's called double

404
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
so it's called double
 

405
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,590
so it's called double
yeah so it's it's efficient the pop

406
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
yeah so it's it's efficient the pop
 

407
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,949
yeah so it's it's efficient the pop
a pen and a pop takes oak on constant

408
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
a pen and a pop takes oak on constant
 

409
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,509
a pen and a pop takes oak on constant
time yeah

410
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
time yeah
 

411
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,269
time yeah
compared to a normal list almond list if

412
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
compared to a normal list almond list if
 

413
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,949
compared to a normal list almond list if
if it's a normal list do this pop zero

414
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
if it's a normal list do this pop zero
 

415
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,509
if it's a normal list do this pop zero
to remove it from the beginning which

416
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
to remove it from the beginning which
 

417
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,150
to remove it from the beginning which
could take

418
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
could take
 

419
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,110
could take
o n right so that's why we use the dq

420
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
o n right so that's why we use the dq
 

421
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,430
o n right so that's why we use the dq
which

422
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
which
 

423
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,949
which
has higher higher performance of the

424
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
has higher higher performance of the
 

425
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,389
has higher higher performance of the
push and append and pop operation which

426
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399

427
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:12,630
push and append and pop operation which
is

428
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
is
 

429
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,750
is
one constant right or one constant one

430
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
one constant right or one constant one
 

431
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,230
one constant right or one constant one
constant means that uh

432
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
constant means that uh
 

433
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,389
constant means that uh
it doesn't it doesn't matter how many

434
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
it doesn't it doesn't matter how many
 

435
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,670
it doesn't it doesn't matter how many
elements are in the

436
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
elements are in the
 

437
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,750
elements are in the
queue in the data structure it's always

438
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
queue in the data structure it's always
 

439
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,590
queue in the data structure it's always
very instant faster right

440
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
very instant faster right
 

441
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,350
very instant faster right
yeah yes got it if it's o-n

442
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
yeah yes got it if it's o-n
 

443
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,350
yeah yes got it if it's o-n
it means that if there are minion items

444
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
it means that if there are minion items
 

445
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,269
it means that if there are minion items
in the element

446
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
in the element
 

447
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,590
in the element
and then if you if it's o-n and

448
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
and then if you if it's o-n and
 

449
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,110
and then if you if it's o-n and
invention it will take

450
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
invention it will take
 

451
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,670
invention it will take
long long time to do this right which is

452
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
long long time to do this right which is
 

453
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,269
