1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,759
we're going to talk about the circle

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,240
today yeah

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,800
because we know this shape for you know

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,920
in real life but the tires of the car

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,240
right your pizza a pie or you know

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,480
whatever the pan whatever

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,960
a cup yeah the shape is very common in

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,439
real life okay the ball

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,160
yeah the ball okay so before that oh you

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,960
like a pen yeah

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,520
well that is a cylinder

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,040
so now let's review our little uh

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,000
some shape yeah

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,600
this is

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,840
square

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,399
and

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,640
squared square is a special case of uh

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,280
rectangle right because look this is a

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,280
all sides are equal a but these

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,079
is different right a and b right and

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,559
then

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,960
if we cut this in half we got a right

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,440
triangle right yeah i think that's for

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,840
the square not rectangle

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,400
if you can't square in half it's a right

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,960
hand no no no if kali is because the

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,880
square is also part of it's very special

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
for the for the rectangular one if

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,680
current is in half right this is the

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,400
thing but if you cut this

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,560
it's also uh

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,640
okay okay i got the meaning okay

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,680
this is different if this is any reason

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,680
b

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,920
okay so this is the shape we already

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,799
know yeah these two actually

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,560
we can categorize them as this one shape

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,400
one time per share okay

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,040
what's that what's the parameter we call

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,119
it parameter is the what's perimeter

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,600
parameter is how

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,520
long all the sizes yeah what's the

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,320
parameter of these

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,520
other parameter is

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,439
it is

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,000
a times

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,880
four times a full time day and what's

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,880
this the

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,520
a square b squared ah yeah you remember

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,920
the formula yeah

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,800
when this is a this is b and this is

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,120
right right angle this side is a square

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,879
plus b squared square root okay

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,879
like if this is three this is four

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,080
this is eight what's that what's the

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,400
next number

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,680
come on think about it quick answer

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,160
uh it is like if this one is eight this

59
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,120
one what was the question again

60
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,000
yeah we're done yeah because 36 plus 64

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,800
is 100 i don't get it what do you mean

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,760
okay

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,239
a

64
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,480
b look at this is a this is b and we

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,360
know this side is a square plus b square

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,760
right and if this is three this is four

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,200
this is five if this sixty this a this

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,080
is ten okay this is just mathematics

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,800
okay

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,879
okay so now how about the area what's

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
the area of this square

72
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,159
what's the area of a square

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,800
area of a square is four times a yeah

74
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,040
a times a a a squared and what's the

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,760
area of these

76
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,800
uh it is

77
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,879
this is a times b divided by 2

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,440
why do we need to divide by 2 divided by

79
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,599
2 will be this one right

80
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,560
right this is a times b right it'll be

81
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,640
like

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,720
okay

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,720
okay okay okay so now this is the base

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,720
diameter

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,799
so circle

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,959
so that we call this

87
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,280
this parameter

88
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,680
we call that circumference

89
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,799
circumference

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,799
circumference okay

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,560
okay so let's define a mass constant

92
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:00,879
mathematic constant i okay yes

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,879
pi this is pi it's not the constant

94
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,760
is the circumference

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,280
circumference

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,120
divided by diameter okay what's diameter

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,040
yeah diameter diameter is the longest

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
longest

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,560
longest line

100
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,959
passing through

101
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,520
passing the center yeah

102
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,840
this side this is diameter and then half

103
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,160
of it we call it radius okay probably

104
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,120
okay radius ah so we can say d equals

105
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,800
one

106
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,600
d equals one

107
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,040
d equals how many times of r d equals

108
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
how many times

109
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,520
d

110
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,639
ah what's the relation between d and

111
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,120
come r very easy how many us

112
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,160
two yeah two times ah way down come on

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,320
come on

114
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,120
what'd you do

115
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,040
okay so this pie you know

116
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,360
we don't have to go into the details but

117
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,680
it's the irrational number irrational

118
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,680
number

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
every lion this is very complicational

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,759
number

121
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,400
okay so what's the opportunity number

122
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
obviously is rational number what's

123
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,639
rational

124
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,600
it's a number that can be expressed as a

125
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,240
fraction simple fraction is p divided by

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,280
q where q not equals zero

127
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,520
okay

128
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,840
an irrational number is the opposite it

129
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,520
cannot a number cannot be

130
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,160
expressed as a simple fraction what's

131
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,360
simple fraction like 0.5

132
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,479
yeah

133
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,440
half

134
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,479
one over four a quarter you know p can

135
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,360
be divided can be expressed p divided by

136
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,520
q where q will not equal zero p and q

137
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,919
are integer okay

138
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,039
right iteration number is the opposite

139
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,120
right so this number pi is actually

140
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,960
approximation of

141
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,440
you know approximation equals three

142
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,000
point one four one five

143
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,639
nine two six fifty three fifty eight

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,400
okay so it never ends it never ends okay

145
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,280
this is the infinity this is going

146
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,960
infinity but it's a best best

147
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,199
approximation would be something like

148
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,600
three point one four one five

149
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,080
nine okay that that would be enough okay

150
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,080
do you get it

151
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,600
so look this pi equals circumference

152
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,759
divided by the diameter right

153
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,120
yeah

154
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,919
okay so now

155
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,560
look we write this here at pi equals c

156
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,479
divided by d and also

157
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,000
we can say d equals 2i this is very

158
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,720
obvious

159
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,600
okay so now using this

160
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,600
how can we prove that the area of the

161
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,280
triangle of

162
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,039
circle

163
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,440
this is a survivor yeah maybe not it

164
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,759
looks like a stone big big egg okay oh

165
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,479
yeah a pizza oh yeah no orange

166
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,400
side view okay so lead this is we want

167
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,919
to get we want to compute the area of

168
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
the

169
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,560
of the circle how can we do this

170
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,440
how can we do this there are a few ways

171
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,199
one one way would be to cutting this

172
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,199
this circle like pizza cutting into

173
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,360
slices yeah yeah

174
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,840
you're cutting lots of slices cutting on

175
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,400
lots of slices and you light it up

176
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,680
right and then you can compute it okay

177
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,120
but today we're going to talk about

178
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,639
another one which is very simple to

179
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,560
understand look

180
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,080
very simple to understand that look we

181
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,160
already know c equals 2 times pi i

182
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
because pi d yeah this is the ratio

183
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,880
remember

184
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,880
c divided by

185
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,000
d equals pi right right so c equals pi

186
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,720
times t

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,120
equals two times pi r okay that's where

188
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,039
we got it okay make sense

189
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,440
c equals two pi okay

190
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,080
what do we do what's what's that

191
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,759
okay we're done okay good job

192
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,000
okay okay

193
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,160
okay now look if we cut it if we if we

194
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
if we have lots of rings right right

195
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,360
lots of rings look at what look at that

196
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,840
where i'm going

197
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,319
yeah pizza if i cut the pizza you know

198
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,759
like that that looks like an onion onion

199
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,720
onion

200
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,280
and then look if i cut it this way

201
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,080
just have a big imagination if i cut it

202
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,319
this way and if i line it up

203
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,080
yeah if i line it up unroll it and draw

204
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,800
it a rainbow

205
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,440
unroll it yeah a rainbow okay so look so

206
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,960
what's the what's the center look at

207
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,759
this center is just you know if i

208
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,120
wrongly it will be little little bit

209
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,640
a little bit

210
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
uh

211
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,120
square right and then a little bit more

212
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,080
i don't get it how do you make one

213
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,720
look look just imagine look if if i cut

214
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,200
if i have lots and lots of the thin

215
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,519
ring and then if i cut it this way

216
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,120
remember just imagine a piece i

217
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,760
cut it this way

218
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,000
and then if if i unroll this bit so what

219
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,560
look for follow

220
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,399
the external side for this big big one

221
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,880
what's the length

222
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,080
what what's the length how do you roll

223
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,440
it

224
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,560
how do you roll it do you have someone

225
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,000
talking about

226
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,399
kind

227
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,440
[Music]

228
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,720
look

229
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
this is a

230
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,519
circle i cut it and i unroll it like a

231
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,000
row

232
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,920
and roll it it's a rainbow frame

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,680
just just just imagine okay and then

234
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,760
look this bit

235
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,959
what's the length of the almost

236
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
yeah right

237
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,240
yeah

238
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,320
yeah so look if i keep doing that the

239
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,640
most in the inner one will be just a

240
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,160
very tiny bit right yeah

241
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,959
and it's not

242
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,480
when it goes on and the piece the slices

243
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,600
become a little bit bigger bigger and i

244
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,080
can put it

245
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,399
here by here and here by here

246
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,399
and here right here okay i'm going going

247
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,800
this way okay going this way

248
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,680
and this this is the most

249
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,680
outside like this is the external one

250
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,279
and what's the length of this how long

251
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,600
is this

252
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,920
how long is this

253
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,160
how long is this

254
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,040
this is a c yeah

255
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,640
the the almost one is the circus uh

256
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,399
circumference right

257
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,200
so this side

258
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,800
is two times pi times r all right

259
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,519
we all know that

260
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,720
yeah if we cut the slices look if we

261
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,120
have this

262
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,959
really really thin

263
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
just really releasing you you don't have

264
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,279
this stack right then everything would

265
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,200
be like a triangle right you yeah

266
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,600
and what's the size of this look you can

267
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,720
guess what's the size of this uh how big

268
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,399
is this

269
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,399
how big is this

270
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,560
yeah we cut it this way right

271
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,160
so what's this

272
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,200
what's this what's the half of a

273
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,200
diameter what's that

274
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,160
what's half of diameter

275
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,279
what's that

276
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,000
say

277
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:53,760
this is diameter what's half

278
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,760
half diameter what's called radius ah

279
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,360
yeah so this is r

280
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,279
okay if we cut the slices so thin

281
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,079
that this is a triangle then you

282
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,240
wouldn't observe the stack right and

283
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,320
what's the area of this triangle

284
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,040
we know no no right

285
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,519
what's the base a

286
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,040
ah times

287
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,360
two pi r

288
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,360
we all we need to do what

289
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
divided by triangle remember

290
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,959
and what do we get

291
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,560
pi

292
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,880
r squared

293
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,079
okay so

294
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,360
the area of a circle is pi times r times

295
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,440
r okay

296
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,920
r is the radius half of the diameter

297
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,839
so let's do this again look how how do

298
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,519
we get food transform from these two

299
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,040
here

300
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,000
we have lots of lots of the very

301
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,399
releasing rings and we cut it half half

302
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,360
yeah we cut it here so this is high and

303
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,279
we put it one by one from the

304
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
smallest to the biggest one the biggest

305
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,600
one which is the outside and the length

306
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,360
will be just the circumference

307
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,600
circumference right

308
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,519
yeah and the smallest will be close to

309
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,880
zero and you put it this way this will

310
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,279
be a triangle

311
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,519
this we know is r this we know is two pi

312
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,600
r it's a circumference and the area will

313
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,639
be this pi r square

314
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,160
okay

315
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,880
make sense

316
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,000
yeah pi r square

317
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,680
okay so now how can we ask computer to

318
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,160
approximate this value because this

319
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,320
value this this this value yeah this

320
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,480
value is not an exact value this is the

321
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,560
approximation yeah this is the best

322
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,959
constant you know in the lens you know

323
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,360
you never like that

324
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,360
the computer now nowadays are trying

325
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,000
very hard you know if you want to

326
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,839
calculate the median positions meaning

327
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
digits of the pi you need a very

328
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,959
powerful computer right and they're

329
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,560
calculating the kick ranking

330
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,200
so

331
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,480
so one way of asking computer to

332
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,399
approximate the value of pi

333
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,839
how can we try this how can we ask

334
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,560
computer to to approximate these pi

335
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,800
values

336
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,279
if i draw

337
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,360
if you try i draw a quarter of pi look

338
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,560
this is the

339
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,680
square this is one one one one

340
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,440
one one if i draw a circle half of a

341
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,519
quarter of the circle yeah can you

342
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,279
imagine yeah it would be something like

343
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,320
that a circle

344
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,200
okay circle yeah you'll be a curve yeah

345
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
oh

346
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,399
okay

347
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:38,320
this the radius of a circle is what

348
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,320
come on there the radio status

349
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,639
one one is one this is zero zero this is

350
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
one

351
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,839
one

352
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,959
okay what's the rate what's the ratio

353
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,959
between you know here the circle

354
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,760
this bit

355
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,920
and the square

356
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,320
one

357
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,800
look we already know that uh

358
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,839
this this is a quarter of circle right

359
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,880
so it's a quarter times pi times r i is

360
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,320
one right

361
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,120
yeah r times r is one and what's this

362
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,519
one

363
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,330
yeah no no no no yeah what's this what's

364
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,480
the area of the square

365
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,360
[Music]

366
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,560
one

367
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,440
yeah

368
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,760
so one common one times one one yeah i

369
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,240
said one so what's the the ratio would

370
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,720
be a quarter of pipe

371
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,000
yeah this is a quarterback

372
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,000
okay a quarter of pi this is the answer

373
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,279
yeah is that one

374
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,959
no no no of course this is not one

375
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,440
this is pi look pi is 3.1415 right

376
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,760
divided by four is

377
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,800
okay yeah so

378
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,639
so how about if we ask computer yeah so

379
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,920
look just imagine imagine that there's a

380
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,519
lesser

381
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,480
there's a pizza

382
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,440
paper

383
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,360
okay pizza and we ate no no no look this

384
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,399
center today

385
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,480
this is a table table and i have a slice

386
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,519
of pizza this way

387
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,920
yeah

388
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,440
and i saw lots of chocolates just inside

389
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,240
this area

390
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,880
armenian chocolate yeah remember what if

391
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,040
they actually george you know just run

392
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,720
them randomly you know

393
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,480
just sprinkling

394
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,320
throwing the chocolates onto this table

395
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,160
what's the probability we talk about

396
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,360
probability how likely it's going to

397
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,079
fall in here

398
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,600
uh

399
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,839
25

400
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,759
25 i know why why is it 25 100

401
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,759
it's less yeah we just talked about

402
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,759
liberation

403
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,000
because this is the area of the of the

404
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,360
of us

405
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,600
25

406
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,440
why is it 20 25 it's very small come on

407
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,759
25 it's just a quarter a quarter how big

408
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,000
is the quarter it's here

409
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,720
maybe just here it's it's just here you

410
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,399
see the 25 here how about this big

411
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,600
slices here

412
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,639
yeah

413
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,920
yeah

414
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,839
so look the probability of of these

415
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,639
coins

416
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,279
falling down on this big pizza

417
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,360
is actually the size of that

418
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,639
is the proportion is proportional to the

419
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,600
side to the

420
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,440
area of this pizza to the table right so

421
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,360
we already know that the area of the

422
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,880
pizza is

423
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,240
this right pi r pi r square divided by

424
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,360
four right because this is just a

425
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,680
quarter

426
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,680
a quarter and the table size is one

427
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,519
times one right one times one is one

428
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,800
yeah so that divided by one that's the

429
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:45,440
ratio that's the ratio between the pizza

430
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,040
the slice of pizza and the

431
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,800
and the table okay

432
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,160
yeah yeah

433
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,720
so look if we ask computers to do this

434
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,639
many many million million times the uh

435
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,800
the probability would be

436
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,639
we can calculate the probability right

437
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,160
we can calculate that the number of

438
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,039
times we can calculate the number of

439
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,959
times the coins falling into this pizza

440
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,360
and the time the number of times it

441
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,120
smells and that would be the pie

442
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,360
now we can get the approximation of pie

443
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,720
got it

444
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,559
makes sense

445
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,160
yeah

446
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,480
okay i'm going to write the shooter code

447
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,120
okay just write the code okay

448
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,280
and then i'll be it okay

449
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,880
sugar no no

450
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,839
define

451
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
pi

452
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,840
pi

453
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,000
p

454
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,760
this this accurate is kind of they said

455
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,280
they give you a fancy name called the

456
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,720
malta

457
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,600
color

458
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,200
what

459
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,720
kind of simulation is that

460
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,760
okay

461
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,240
wait

462
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,200
i think they're trying to spell [ __ ]

463
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,200
color simulation

464
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,799
okay

465
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,720
okay

466
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,840
i think they're trying to so look let's

467
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,400
try look at

468
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,080
this so let's say n n is the number of

469
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,000
times that we want to compute the

470
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,039
smaller coins yeah

471
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,600
the more

472
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,720
the more the better right if you slow

473
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,720
two

474
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,760
then there's no way to get calculated

475
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,559
yeah

476
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,320
am i two so the more coins you throw the

477
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,760
better accuracy

478
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,039
approximation

479
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,240
make sense

480
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,280
see that

481
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,799
so

482
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,640
let's say

483
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,760
total total

484
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,840
equals

485
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,280
and the number of coins inside falling

486
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,240
inside the pizza

487
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,360
inside

488
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,039
okay

489
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,760
at the beginning is zero and then i need

490
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,039
to

491
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,679
try

492
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,679
for underscore in range and then again

493
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,799
i need to generate two random values to

494
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,640
point where it located it could be x y

495
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,520
right this x y

496
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,919
so i can x equals random okay so this is

497
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,600
a function from random what's random

498
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,559
what does it mean

499
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,720
render

500
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,120
when what's random

501
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,120
it can

502
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,160
so it means that you know just by luck

503
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,880
okay it's just good like

504
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,880
i guess like

505
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,880
like

506
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,360
any possibility

507
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,799
yeah so you throw a coin it's a coin

508
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,280
the

509
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,600
the probability of falling

510
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,240
the coin facing upwards is random right

511
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,080
50 right it could be it could be up it

512
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,960
could be down right depending on that

513
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,799
right

514
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,960
make sense yeah okay this is random is

515
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,360
from the random package so you need to

516
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,200
say you need to use in order to use this

517
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,360
function you need to say from random

518
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,960
input random and random is a function

519
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,760
that returns the

520
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,799
probability a number a random number

521
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,799
from

522
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,480
bigger than zero and smaller than one

523
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,720
okay it's a fraction number it could be

524
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,320
0.5 or the next time you call it it

525
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,799
could be 20.75

526
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,320
730.61 okay am i

527
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,600
so if i

528
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,080
generate two random numbers

529
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,799
to generate 200 numbers

530
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,880
right these two numbers so how can we

531
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,240
know look alright how can we know if

532
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,799
this point

533
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,799
how can we know if this point is falling

534
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,760
inside the pizza and not outside the

535
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,760
pizza how can we know

536
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,559
if what

537
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,919
no no no i generate a random point yeah

538
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,760
i generate lots of points here and also

539
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,159
how can i know if this point is inside

540
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,840
the p sign not outside the pizza how do

541
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,880
we check if the

542
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,880
if it's in

543
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,960
look this is the radius

544
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,760
and the distance between this point to

545
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,520
to the center is what

546
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,520
if it's inside it's smaller than

547
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,880
ah if it's out bigger then you'll be

548
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,280
bigger yeah yeah

549
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,240
so how to calculate the distance

550
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,840
look this is x this is y

551
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,600
this is x this is y

552
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,799
what so that's the distance what's that

553
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,799
extension

554
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,919
x squared plus y squared we know this

555
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,720
already right

556
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:28,240
so look if x squared

557
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,200
plus y square smaller or equal equal

558
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,440
yeah one then

559
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,080
inside

560
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,559
plus equals one right

561
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,480
and look total point total point is

562
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,080
actually n right we don't need to

563
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,919
we don't need to

564
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,120
increment it because we are throwing n

565
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:51,200
times right inside and now after we

566
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,200
solve all these the pi is what we tend

567
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,960
inside

568
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,120
divided by n times 4 right

569
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,440
y transform because look remember i

570
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,400
talked about this proportional

571
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,280
pi divided by 4 yeah this value inside

572
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,840
divided by n is 5 divided by 4 and if we

573
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,960
times 4 that would be the value of pi

574
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,640
right and if this n is

575
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,400
bigger the more

576
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,640
the larger n we got the better

577
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,799
approximation right if it's like two

578
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,960
times three times you wouldn't get a

579
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,520
very good approximation to the pi

580
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,039
make sense

581
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,880
yeah you are still with me yes ryan this

582
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,720
is mathematics this is is this

583
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,679
challenging to you

584
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,860
yeah

585
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,520
is this channel

586
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,840
[Music]

587
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,919
you want me to repeat

588
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,280
again eric do you want me to repeat this

589
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,120
a bit again

590
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,520
do you get it

591
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,520
to get it so what are we doing here

592
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,880
we're throwing end coins yeah we're

593
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,400
trying like

594
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,760
this

595
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,760
because at random random function return

596
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,840
the value between a random value between

597
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,559
zero to one right so it's always on this

598
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,480
big table right and we are just counting

599
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,200
we're just counting what counting the

600
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,600
number of times when this coin falls

601
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,360
into this pizza

602
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,799
a quarter of a third a quarter of the

603
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,679
circle

604
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,280
and if we fall in the pizza we increment

605
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,360
the counter inside we count the number

606
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,960
of times it falls inside

607
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,760
and then if we divide it the number of

608
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
times

609
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,480
we throw

610
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,960
then the value will be approximation of

611
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,400
a quarter of the pie right we times four

612
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,400
that would be a pie

613
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,000
right a little bit of pie

614
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,080
all right

615
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,679
so okay so what have we done what have

616
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,640
we learned so far so today we learned

617
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,640
about the area of pi okay one question

618
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,559
what's the area of pi

619
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,080
what's the area of pi if this is the

620
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,279
radius is r

621
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,279
what's the area of pi come on

622
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,159
what's the parameter of pi

623
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,840
the second

624
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,440
conference

625
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,960
[Music]

626
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,279
circumference please remember

627
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,840
what's pi pi equals c divided

628
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,679
circumference divided by diameter

629
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,200
so the pi

630
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,159
meter divided by

631
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,919
diameter equals two times diameter a

632
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:19,279
diameter so what's c c was pi times t

633
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:23,279
what's d b d equals 2 times r so what's

634
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:26,640
c c equals 2 times pi times r okay

635
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,640
i have two times p times r

636
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,000
yeah and we have shown we have learned

637
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,080
why this is pi r square because we you

638
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
know color cut a piece i color pizza and

639
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,279
then

640
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,360
and put it

641
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,200
as a triangle and we calculate the area

642
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,679
right using the triangle right

643
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,760
and then this this

644
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,080
and this one is called mountain carlo

645
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,080
simulation because we randomly throw in

646
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,840
the coins and then we count the number

647
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,960
of times the samples here the number of

648
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,240
samples they falls inside the pizza

649
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,400
and then we can calculate the

650
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,400
approximation of the quarter pi if we

651
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,880
times four that will be the pack

652
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,120
okay so you want to see how we get your

653
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,520
own computers just uh because i have

654
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,000
this so let's see how we get it on

655
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,400
computers okay let's do this

656
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,240
okay i'm going to write you see

657
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,679
is it

658
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,960
yeah

659
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,000
okay so look if we run this uh i'm going

660
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,080
to

661
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,360
erase this bit

662
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,679
look

663
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,520
uh yeah we count the number of we

664
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,360
generally learn the number and we times

665
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,880
if it is smaller than one because that's

666
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,360
the distance if it's smaller than y

667
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,640
means inside and we count it yeah and we

668
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,120
if we do this we run it

669
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,440
you see it's very close to pi but it's

670
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,559
not quite yeah if we increase the least

671
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,520
number

672
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,360
to say

673
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,520
you know make it

674
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,600
make it a hundred times for uh bigger

675
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,159
then it takes more time right it takes

676
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,080
no run but look the result is very close

677
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,840
to pi right you see

678
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,600
make

679
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,520
sense yeah make sense

680
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,679
yeah make sense wow

681
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,120
yeah we don't we don't actually need the

682
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,710
total yeah because we don't need to

683
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,880
