1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,640
go

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:07,040
hello mr mr ryan are you right yeah

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,280
today is christmas eve okay

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,400
so yesterday we talked about directly a

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,759
cyclic and the topology sorting topology

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,640
sorting

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,720
with regarding to dig directives a

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,359
cyclic graph is that for example this

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,000
given is directly a cyclic graph a

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,240
points to b b points to c that's the

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,080
dependency look in order to finish to

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,199
complete to visit the node b we have to

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,079
visit a first in order to finish c

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,800
yeah c we have to visit b and that order

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,040
will be abc that's the only way to visit

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,040
all the nodes right

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,040
and

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,960
yesterday what are we talking what did

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,360
we talk about yesterday

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,280
topology so yeah yesterday we talked

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,840
about we haven't actually talked about

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,000
sorting yet but we talked about where to

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,719
start the visiting notes for example

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,760
here

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,920
how do we

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,719
how do we do it because if it does have

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,000
in in grade or something like that in

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,600
degree yeah

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,240
we check like in degree if it's in

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,360
degree in degree is the number of energy

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,680
points to

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,720
the vertex yeah focus on b in degrees

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,560
one article is going out of the vertex

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,759
this one so we

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,000
compute we also we up uh iterate the

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,600
edges integrate over the edges and we

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,680
updated the

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,240
in degree and then again we go through

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,040
the vertices again and we find out a

40
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,119
collection of the vertex which has the

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,360
in degree equals zero means that there's

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,280
no dependency there's no edges pointing

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,159
to it it means there's no dependency we

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,640
can start it right away right this

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,399
yesterday we're talking about to find

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,720
the minimum notes

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,000
starting visiting the graph okay

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,240
and we use the in degree and then g gb

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,560
means that to update the in degree b

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,040
because the edge a points to b and then

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,680
b in degree needs to be incremented by

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,799
one and then we go through the edges

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,600
nodes again and if the indegree is zero

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,399
we can put it in the starting node list

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,039
okay the time convexity is not o n

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,040
actually it's all n plus m yeah

57
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,160
to be more precise

58
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,160
n is the number of nodes

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,200
here and

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,000
okay so look

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,120
we are visiting the edges this is added

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,920
here so this is all m if there is number

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,840
m number of edges and then the next loop

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,200
will be visiting the nodes there will be

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,319
n nodes okay so n o n plus m

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,920
right

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,400
or you can say o max

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,480
and m okay sometimes you can write it

69
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,480
this way right so look

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,200
the first step iterating over the edges

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,200
the second step iterating over the notes

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,280
the time space complexity using the

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,680
nodes let's o n

74
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,239
what's this these yeah always so let's

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,760
face complexity is our n okay

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,840
okay yeah

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,000
given there are n vertices for example

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,680
given they are inverted what's the

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,239
maximum number of the edges for this n

80
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,920
vertex if they are simple if this is a

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,159
simple graph remember it's like we

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,040
talked about single quad yeah this is

83
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,480
the simple graph single graph but this

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,959
is not yeah

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,959
yeah because

86
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,480
two notes there are one edges three

87
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,480
notes

88
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,239
three edges four notes how many can you

89
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,879
get

90
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,840
how about these two

91
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,000
six and finals

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,599
how many edges can you get look this is

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,760
a complete vlog

94
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,920
but but again i have added one more

95
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,080
edges i did one more vertex so what

96
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,239
happened i can have one more edges to

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,920
the previous and notes right

98
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,200
yeah

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,680
make sense

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,360
do you get it it looks like this

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,599
so how do we get it

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,519
how do we get it what we have one one

103
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,680
vertex what's the number of edges yeah

104
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,000
two two vertex

105
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,159
one i have points to the previous one

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,239
yeah plus plus one right so let's plus

107
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,439
one so i have two

108
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,400
i have

109
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,799
another

110
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,440
vertex here so how many vertex how many

111
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,959
edges i added

112
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,240
plus one

113
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,120
plus two

114
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,120
and i have look this is

115
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,440
this is three vertices i added one more

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,919
vertex how many edges i can have

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,880
plus one

118
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,360
three yeah exactly so look i have n

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,639
vertex i don't know how many how many

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,120
you got yeah

121
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,360
but i added one more edges one more

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,199
vertex i can have n

123
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,600
and yeah and more vertical edges right

124
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,759
so the answer will be one

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,520
the answer will be one

126
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,440
this is number of vertices number of

127
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,160
vertex yeah

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,479
look zero zero that's one

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,560
that's three yeah one three

130
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,600
i know what's next

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:13,120
one plus two three plus three six yeah

132
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,120
look so it's n n minus one

133
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,240
n times n minus one yeah

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,199
divided by two am i right let's put it

135
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,560
zero is zero one

136
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,360
uh

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,680
one is still zero that's not right

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
okay what one yeah one is zero yeah

139
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,840
that's right two

140
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,680
two two times one

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,039
yeah three

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,360
three times

143
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,759
two divided by two is three that's right

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,400
four four vertex four times three

145
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,160
divided by two six edges it's right yeah

146
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,000
do you how do you see how we're getting

147
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,440
this yeah

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,759
yeah

149
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,160
makes sense look plus one plus two plus

150
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,199
three plus four plus five right it's

151
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,039
it's

152
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,880
yeah it's it's like the number of words

153
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,280
yeah it's quite similar to to the number

154
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,120
of the subjects for

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,680
for n size this mri

156
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,560
okay so look

157
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,800
the topology starting is the order yeah

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,600
how can we get this yeah how can you get

159
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,319
this

160
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
look

161
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,240
this part is

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,280
is putting all the notes putting all the

163
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,800
notes here the answer answer is the if

164
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,720
answer is the number of notes we can

165
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,319
start okay how about if i change this to

166
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,720
dq right

167
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,759
and if i said pq what what's in your

168
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,039
mind

169
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,039
what kind of ignorance is the associated

170
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,160
yeah so how about i put it in the dq

171
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,919
right and then i do this breakfast

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,600
search right

173
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,840
yeah and what happened so i need to

174
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,800
update it i need to update it uh when i

175
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,050
do the

176
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,919
traversal right okay

177
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,319
[Music]

178
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,880
so this will be the same okay answer

179
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,560
yeah this means i will be the same so i

180
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,240
don't i don't write it okay and then now

181
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,240
let's say let's say you put in q

182
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,360
p q

183
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,440
q dot attend and yeah

184
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,520
and then now i can do this

185
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,520
wire

186
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,160
wire cube right

187
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,160
wire cube

188
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,080
four

189
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,000
okay okay come on do you want to finish

190
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,000
this quicker come on

191
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,599
while here

192
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
so

193
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,199
what's the first step to do the pressure

194
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,919
search

195
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,759
so i have this current q dot top left

196
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,800
yeah

197
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,560
now

198
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,560
okay so there's one thing missing yeah

199
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,000
because look i need to

200
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,879
i have this dependency but i need to

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,680
i need to remember which nodes

202
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,639
yeah which knows coming coming out of it

203
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,720
right

204
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,039
so we have to

205
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,000
integrate but we also have to remember

206
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,280
the notes that are coming out of it

207
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,319
make sense

208
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,319
why is that because because look yeah

209
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,680
look a to

210
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,199
b

211
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,080
this is c yeah in order to finish c

212
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
yeah

213
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,599
in order to finish it i have to finish a

214
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,520
and b first right yeah if i finish a and

215
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,759
finish b

216
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,560
and then i possibly can start with c i'm

217
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,800
right

218
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,360
yeah so look let's see information look

219
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,000
i have this in

220
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,120
i need to remember a note article i'll

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,120
degree so i need to look g b equals a

222
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,680
and then i need to have a node

223
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,920
nodes okay node will be

224
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,880
also default dictionary which is a list

225
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,920
of uh

226
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,600
which is the list of integer right

227
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,440
so the node

228
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,959
a points to b so i need to a node a

229
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,360
plus append b right yeah

230
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,040
yeah so look a

231
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,600
a will point

232
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,840
so i can i can

233
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,120
i can use this information to

234
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,600
[Music]

235
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,760
to see how many edges coming from a

236
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,640
right and how many edges coming to b so

237
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,040
i can just use the n right so look

238
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,760
i currently get a node c

239
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:29,440
and then i need to fall a in no c right

240
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,200
so this is a is the note coming from the

241
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,240
c okay

242
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,480
yeah

243
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,519
okay i will ask a question later you

244
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
need to

245
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,560
listen carefully okay

246
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,640
no c

247
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,800
what's nothing

248
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,240
next is the

249
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,480
thing that comes in from

250
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,480
in

251
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,600
yeah gb look this is a to b right b is

252
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,560
the

253
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,560
in degree a points to b yeah

254
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,279
okay yeah

255
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,079
a b and that is a point to b b

256
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,560
in degree plus equal one a

257
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,399
knows a plus equal b well what's this

258
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,680
mean what what does this mean

259
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,880
what's here what's this mean you think

260
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,360
that um now is the defaultionally least

261
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,200
type in this in okay it's the same it's

262
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:27,279
the same type okay node a it means the a

263
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,880
a has one more edges coming out of a

264
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,160
to b right

265
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,720
yeah

266
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,079
so i go through this it means that i

267
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,640
iterate

268
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,519
i iterate all the edges all the edges

269
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,160
from coming out of c and if i coming out

270
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,040
of c what happened look this is c

271
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,040
uh

272
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,040
i'm currently i see right

273
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,720
and then this a this points to a right

274
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,800
okay look

275
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,760
c go to a right and then now

276
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,079
c is the number is current one and then

277
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,720
c needs to put if i finish c

278
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,760
then i need to do what i need to do what

279
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,360
for this one i need to do what a so look

280
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,440
i remove one dependency from c from a

281
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,399
from yeah from a

282
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,120
c

283
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,519
c is the dependency of a points to a and

284
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,720
now i visit c so it means that this

285
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,839
dependency this integral should be

286
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,160
what

287
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,000
increment of my decrement

288
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,320
in degree increment

289
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,880
i i have this already i have calculated

290
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,360
this plus one equal already and now i've

291
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,519
reached c already so what's the what

292
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,120
should i do with sorry

293
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,279
decrement exactly because i already

294
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,800
visited c so look there's one less thing

295
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,600
to to do

296
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,640
you know

297
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,600
there might be another one called d

298
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,720
yeah look to finish a you need to put

299
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,720
the c and d first right and smiley face

300
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,720
yeah

301
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,839
minus equals one right this is integrity

302
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,920
minus one right because we already

303
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,680
visited one c so there's one less thing

304
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,399
to worry about

305
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,639
yeah and look if this in degree becomes

306
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,519
zero what happened what should we do

307
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,079
um

308
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,320
if it is already if i minus one here and

309
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,160
then minus one so what happened what

310
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,720
happened to this a you only have a small

311
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,720
difference

312
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,639
come on listen carefully yeah

313
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,480
if i look at a if i usually c and b c d

314
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,560
so what happened to a the integral will

315
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,560
become one zero so what happened in this

316
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,600
case if we in degrees zero what should

317
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,760
we do now we can visit it right so what

318
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,440
should we do with the q

319
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,720
what should we do

320
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,399
put it in the kill yeah look if g

321
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,920
a

322
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,160
then we can put it in the queue right

323
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,160
because look a is free now right we

324
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,320
already finished c and d minus one minus

325
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,079
one and then we can just say q dot

326
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,839
append

327
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,399
apparent

328
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,399
apparent

329
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,000
yeah look the order is coming out for

330
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,600
problem this is the topology starting

331
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,800
yeah

332
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,880
makes sense

333
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,399
so what's the topology starting what

334
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,200
what's the argument we're talking about

335
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,959
here

336
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
okay

337
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,200
so

338
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,499
what's the topology starting yeah

339
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,499
[Music]

340
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:44,160
[Music]

341
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,920
so i have another graph here so you tell

342
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,519
me can you tell me one of the technology

343
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,360
stories you know the topology starting

344
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,040
might be different there might be a

345
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,760
difference just give me one of them all

346
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,000
right

347
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,000
yeah

348
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,040
points for c

349
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,959
and then d here points to b

350
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,959
point to

351
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,240
okay

352
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,399
okay so what's the topology sorting of

353
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,530
the this class come on

354
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,679
i need

355
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,679
[Music]

356
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,519
which one is also okay a

357
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,120
i mean can you look i give you a hint

358
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,040
what's this d can we swap with t and a

359
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,120
i mean can we start with p as well yeah

360
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,240
yeah because it's defective independent

361
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,480
yeah

362
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,560
and then you do one a you finish a then

363
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,710
you can finish b and c right

364
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,000
b

365
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,800
[Music]

366
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,600
c and then e okay so this is also okay

367
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,959
there are two topologies sorting okay

368
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,380
yeah

369
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,160
makes sense yeah

370
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,440
[Music]

371
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,279
and look we use the q first of all so

372
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,199
for the topology sorting what are the

373
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,440
initial notes

374
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,079
what what what should we put to the

375
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,079
queue first

376
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,240
we're done you're listening yes

377
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,079
and then

378
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,639
once we visit we take it this is the

379
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,399
kind of like breakfast look q equals uh

380
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,920
c equals q to the power black so we take

381
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,600
one from the kill

382
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,720
and then what should we do here what's

383
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,720
this what should we do here

384
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,160
we go

385
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:58,639
[Music]

386
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,480
so we'll take take one out look we take

387
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,199
one out and then if uh

388
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,000
if

389
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,680
um in degree is zero then you just put

390
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,920
it into the key

391
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,079
okay so for example i take the cr yeah

392
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,519
look c can be started i take it out so

393
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,519
what what should i do with next

394
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,480
what's this lc

395
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,079
d

396
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,399
what's lc

397
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,800
what's n c means

398
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,160
what's nc here

399
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,720
without degree

400
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,240
the number of the edges that the vertex

401
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,120
that points

402
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,480
from

403
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,360
c yeah so look nc will be

404
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,600
a

405
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,839
yeah yeah

406
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,320
yeah and c will be a

407
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,399
right because that there's a vertex

408
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,959
coming out of c and c

409
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,079
and then like goes through the out

410
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,000
out notes right out notes and then look

411
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,920
because i'm visiting with c already so

412
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,639
it means that a has

413
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,639
one less dependency right

414
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,959
one has less dependency and then i need

415
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,880
to decrement the integ in degree minus

416
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,880
one and when this a is

417
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,499
[Music]

418
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,280
how do you pronounce that one

419
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,079
the thing that depends on a

420
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,400
yeah

421
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,280
all the things that depends on a like c

422
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,160
d or whatever there's another e here

423
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,679
all the in degree all the edges come

424
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,760
going to a

425
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:38,640
cde these dependencies have been visited

426
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,960
so it means that i can visit a now

427
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,320
so when i want to visit it i can put it

428
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,280
back to the cube

429
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,960
right

430
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,480
so the number of edges look at the

431
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,559
number of edges whenever we we

432
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,280
we find out the

433
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,360
whenever we decrement the edges yeah now

434
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,919
we can have this in

435
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,480
r plus equals when i equals zero right

436
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,360
and then at the end we just check if

437
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,520
this r equals the number of edges in

438
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,120
this square if it's number e equals to

439
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,799
the number of edges in about what does

440
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,360
it mean

441
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,240
right every look i have three for

442
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,039
example i have three edges here right

443
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,840
and every time i sequence one edge one

444
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,200
dependency i i plus equals one and i

445
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,240
check this r

446
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,559
if it's

447
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,400
equal to the total number of edges if

448
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,120
it's equal to the total number of edges

449
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,880
it means that i can fit in all the notes

450
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,400
in this graph right

451
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,160
right make sense if if i cut if this r

452
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,720
is not incremented to

453
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,960
the total edges means that i cannot

454
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,559
i cannot right let's let's take an

455
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,360
example like

456
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,480
a

457
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,440
just simple example yeah b

458
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,320
c

459
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,840
okay this this look this graph yeah we

460
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,760
can't right

461
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,720
okay

462
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,440
so look we okay so maybe maybe we put

463
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,240
another one d yeah so the starting note

464
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,039
will be only d right in the queue right

465
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,600
yeah

466
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,160
right so the only edge is one two three

467
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,039
four four edges four edges

468
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,919
yeah four edges the starting point would

469
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,640
be

470
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,320
d

471
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:19,440
so i take dr right i take the dr what is

472
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,960
our degree a right

473
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,080
so i increment i i a g

474
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,840
g a minus 1 look how many what's the in

475
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,880
degree of a here t

476
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,400
what's the integral of a g

477
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,760
then what's the number of in degree one

478
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,880
how is the one

479
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,039
two right look two so i only increment

480
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,120
one so it's one already right

481
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,600
and then the next time

482
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,400
next time the queue is empty and then i

483
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,520
just clicked so r will be only one we

484
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,080
only able to remove one edges right and

485
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,039
let's say how many edges we have got

486
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,880
four edges what does it mean

487
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,200
if r is not equal to

488
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,039
number of edges right oh we can say i is

489
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,440
the number of edges and r minus equals

490
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,840
right if i is not zero

491
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,840
mean

492
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,400
okay and then i look every time i remove

493
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,400
our dependency i remove one ah minus

494
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,280
equals one i would be three now so what

495
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,320
happened

496
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,919
zero

497
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,000
you can do

498
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,679
i completed all the notes right if i

499
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,120
it's not zero it means i can obviously i

500
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,760
don't know all right

501
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,919
yeah this is topology something based on

502
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,919
breakfast it's similar to breakfast yeah

503
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,919
the only difference okay so today is

504
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,440
take away the only difference is what we

505
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,159
suppose facility you know you know the

506
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,200
level by level right level by level we

507
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,000
use the q dq yeah push to the right a

508
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,640
pen

509
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,880
pop left yeah take one out or take

510
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,039
everything all right the difference is

511
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,280
what we push

512
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,960
we push the note with in degree equal

513
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,159
zero to the q

514
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,679
and

515
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,159
we

516
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,039
decrement the out

517
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,720
the edges coming out of it look this is

518
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,960
current note and then there are many

519
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,280
many notes pointing out yeah and then i

520
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,200
need to increase that

521
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,760
i need to decrement uh

522
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,840
the in degree for this right for the

523
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,159
nodes that coming out of it and once

524
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,520
this in degree is zero then we push it

525
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
back to the cube

526
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,840
exactly and then order of taking all the

527
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,720
nodes from the queue

528
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,200
is called topology sorting

529
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,960
this this is useful

530
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,559
for example like i give you a list of

531
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,880
tasks that has dependency and then you

532
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,760
need to tell me the sequence right abcs

533
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,919
play piano do homework and then do what

534
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,880
you want and playing game right you need

535
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:48,880
to plan make a plan this is property

536
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,360
sorting helps you to do the term okay

537
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,280
yeah and then you also find can tell us

538
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,880
that if we can

539
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,600
if we can visit all the nodes in a

540
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,679
directive a cyclic uh no directive graph

541
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,760
okay exactly means that it's not

542
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,240
impossible right make sense

543
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,320
yeah you see this is really useful right

544
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,520
this is useful

545
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,280
yeah

546
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,600
okay that's it for today that's it for

547
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,840
today good job bye

548
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,840
bye
