1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,800
okay so today we are going to talk about

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,800
the two players zero sum game two player

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,000
zero game oh yeah oh pokemon game we'll

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,680
see through some game

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,840
so what does it mean

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,080
two player okay two player thing you

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,680
have to play you two play everyone so

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,920
it's just two players

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,279
you know some what zero sum means it

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,239
means if i

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,000
if i win you have to lose if i win 10

12
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,480
dollars you lose 10

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
right yeah so that

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,879
makes sense

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,120
yeah

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,680
so the only one

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,879
one winner for one to win the other has

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,960
to lose

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,039
all right so i'll give you an example

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
like a tick tick tick tock do you

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
understand

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,239
another tic tac toe

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,360
it's pretty unfair because you already

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,480
know

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,239
okay so

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,640
yeah you want to play you want to play

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,640
stickers

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,680
i use this one

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,040
different color okay

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,040
come on who is going to flat before

31
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,139
[Music]

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,840
that's a very smart move to to occupy

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,840
the one in the center yeah

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,720
okay

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,280
um

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,280
nothing else

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,520
okay

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
okay

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,520
good job

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,759
yeah i know i mean

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,720
so if we if you both played

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,040
intelligently i mean you know smart

43
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,759
right so it will be the draw anyway

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,920
right because this is so small and then

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,399
yeah the first people occupy the center

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,399
because it's it's around here

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,320
yeah yeah it has more chances you know

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,640
the rows

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,640
i don't diagnose that

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,000
so look this is the jaw

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,280
draw yeah draws nobody wins nobody lose

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,720
so nobody we nobody knows who we call it

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,080
uh we we just call it zero okay yeah

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,959
yeah

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,120
so let's go the the score is zero

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,680
so this this is a two player zero game

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,800
so look zero sum if the jaw is is

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,840
uh it's a zero okay so if let's say if

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
the

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,120
uh the first player yeah the first

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,400
player will call it asian yeah a player

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,879
two players

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,480
players so it's just it's a

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,720
it's a tupper so

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,800
two players agent

66
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,160
agent and then the other one is called

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
opponent yeah yeah opponent agent will

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,160
be

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,160
cross yeah

70
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,840
yeah

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,640
asian

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,480
opponents yeah okay

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,480
so hey hey

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,480
hey

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,239
then then you're eight then the agent is

76
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,599
your opposing team that's right yeah

77
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,920
agent or probably

78
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,840
it's just the term yeah you can say eric

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,879
ryan just two players playing each other

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,080
against each other so an agent if agent

81
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,159
wins yeah if asian wins the player agent

82
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,640
wins then we give it like

83
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,760
let's say let's give it um infinity yeah

84
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,040
infinity

85
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,040
if the opponent win

86
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:50,799
we give it minus infinity yeah yeah

87
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,920
so so you see we give a very big value

88
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,560
for a page and when opponent has to lose

89
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,480
right so if look it's added together

90
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,599
it's a zero that's why you call it zero

91
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,799
sum okay

92
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,720
yeah so the opponent is trying to

93
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,040
minimize

94
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,840
minimize the score

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,959
the agent is trying to maximize the

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,840
score

97
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,680
make sense

98
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,280
yeah any questions so far

99
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,519
is it just is it

100
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,199
what is your appointment against a high

101
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,479
score

102
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,360
no no this is this is the

103
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,720
so let's say two players so your

104
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,880
target

105
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
your target is

106
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,199
is different right you are trying to

107
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,919
maximize the score you are trying to

108
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,199
minimize the score if you win you can

109
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,360
lease if you win you got this okay

110
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,520
make sense but that's how we call it

111
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,960
two-player zero sum okay

112
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,720
okay so connect why doesn't it be one

113
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,479
rather than infinity

114
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,199
good question

115
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,360
yes

116
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,680
one i mean

117
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,560
that's a very good question

118
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,919
we use the infinity means that you know

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,720
just a special value to say okay it's uh

120
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,199
um you know it's the

121
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,160
it's end the game is ended

122
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,880
right for example if if if

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,479
if i have a gap i have i have not ended

124
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,759
yet right so if i the first one agent

125
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,960
put the products plus x in the center so

126
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,600
it's more

127
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,440
for asian it's it's quite good right

128
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,440
it's it's which one is better why would

129
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,680
i put it but

130
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,320
if they've been in the middle they can't

131
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,440
they might be kind of dumb and didn't

132
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,440
win

133
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,600
no no no what i'm saying like okay so

134
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
now your agent and then there's your

135
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,919
first move which one is better put it

136
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,680
here i'll put it here

137
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,680
the one in the middle because it's more

138
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,199
you have more angles that's right so

139
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,520
what do you call it this is the better

140
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,919
move than that one right so let's say i

141
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,000
want to put assign this a better move so

142
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,960
let's say i give it a 100

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,120
and this i will probably give you 20 off

144
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,039
you know so in this way i can compare

145
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,520
these two moves which is better this one

146
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,800
is better so i would prefer this this

147
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,600
move okay

148
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,319
that's why we say okay the infinity

149
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,360
means the optimum goal right we'll end

150
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,160
it okay

151
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,039
okay so i'm gonna define uh

152
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,039
a few

153
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,639
i think i know how to win yeah i don't

154
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,199
know when okay so

155
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,000
before i define a few few terms these

156
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,240
two two players here again needs to be

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,319
like transparent so everybody knows

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,039
exactly what happened on the ball right

159
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,000
so not like a pokemon

160
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,919
poke yeah pokemon you don't know what's

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,080
your opponent's hand yeah what's the

162
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,360
card on your opponent yeah that's not a

163
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,120
two player

164
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,600
you know something because

165
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,280
you don't know and everything right you

166
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,160
have to guess you have to um

167
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,319
i mean you have to think about

168
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,759
what your opponent

169
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,400
could have right

170
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,280
it could have a me too

171
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,199
center scotch

172
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,880
so let's say divide a few um a few terms

173
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,400
value

174
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,919
so let's call a state okay

175
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,800
what state

176
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,639
what state of the game is the state of

177
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,639
the game uh united states

178
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,840
stay

179
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,720
is the current p look current the

180
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,560
situation everything situation only is

181
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,120
ball on the ball

182
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,680
and then whose turn is it right that's

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:41,440
the calling state okay so state has the

184
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,440
position and then player

185
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,240
yeah yeah player has advantage of it

186
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,800
okay

187
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,919
okay so stay

188
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,919
stay would be the

189
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,400
the crosses and the circles

190
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,000
you know

191
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,720
all about

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,759
and whose turn is it next okay

193
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,360
and then we also need to define the

194
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,400
is n

195
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,720
its n needs to tell me if this is

196
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,840
already ended

197
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,000
yeah

198
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,919
it could be a draw or could be somebody

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,800
wins so this is ended because it's a

200
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,800
draw and if i say here

201
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
then this is also empty because the

202
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,019
crosses win okay

203
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,019
[Music]

204
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,399
okay okay uh

205
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,519
so

206
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,560
i can't put a circle here but because

207
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,640
there are two wins yeah let's say this

208
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,240
one okay

209
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,519
this is ending because the closest win

210
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,519
okay

211
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,680
but this is not only because

212
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:56,560
you still have one more choice uh maybe

213
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,680
here no yeah oh obviously

214
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,560
okay

215
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,080
now uh the actions we need to define the

216
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,240
action

217
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,360
action will be taking the

218
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,839
state

219
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,959
we'll be taking the

220
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,600
state and

221
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,600
also the

222
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,640
so

223
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:19,680
okay so no no action is actually the

224
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
next the play the possible play uh

225
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,160
players actions

226
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,760
so for example the actions could be

227
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,640
either you put it here or put it here

228
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
right

229
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,800
yeah

230
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,560
okay so this is the action yeah

231
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,959
yeah make sense

232
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,200
okay so what's next then we have uh

233
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,480
utility utility utility utility utility

234
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,040
is the

235
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,370
gives that it only applies to the

236
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,800
uh

237
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,040
[Music]

238
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,320
the state is ended so when the state is

239
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,480
ended utility tells me who is the win

240
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,720
yeah yeah who is win

241
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,839
who is winning right so he basically

242
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,440
tell me okay if it's action players yeah

243
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
you basically tell me when this is

244
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,279
landing who is wing if it's a draw give

245
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,040
me that you know if it's asian wing give

246
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,720
me the

247
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,519
infinity if it's the opponent give me

248
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,600
the minus yeah okay so i know we have

249
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,680
another one which is called success

250
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
success successor

251
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,880
is it successor how do you spell this

252
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,399
word

253
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,279
what's this name

254
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,279
success

255
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,640
it means sock

256
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,640
what's it mean what's this

257
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,200
okay no no no no no it's not successful

258
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,320
it means the next one the next

259
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,040
yeah the next so it takes the state

260
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,760
and it takes the action so it needs to

261
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,760
return the next state so it basically

262
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,480
now i'm currently in this state i know

263
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,480
what the action what's the action right

264
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,200
for example this is the state and i want

265
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,519
to put the cross here right so basically

266
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
i want to pull across here

267
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,480
i want to put a cross here

268
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,480
right

269
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,519
and then

270
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,079
this is a new state right so look if

271
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,040
this cross then the next day will be

272
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,680
leased

273
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,000
the state contains the the positions and

274
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,920
the whose player so who's who's playing

275
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,240
next because the cross is playing the

276
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,680
previous so the next one should be

277
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,640
closed right yeah that's the state okay

278
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,240
okay so these are five elements stay

279
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,880
is ended action utility a successor okay

280
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,839
so it's uh

281
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,839
so stay

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,959
stay okay

283
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,440
stay started yeah

284
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,600
utility action

285
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,600
and then the successor okay

286
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,839
so

287
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,040
let's uh

288
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,440
let's find out let's uh play another

289
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,600
game okay so let's say we're given a

290
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,800
number n

291
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,320
and in each item

292
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,959
in each one

293
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,040
you can decrement this number by one or

294
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,880
you can divide it by two

295
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,120
if it's an odd number you're just taking

296
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,399
the you know the the four flowing

297
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,639
remember this

298
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,480
uh 2.5

299
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,320
floor is two right

300
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,519
yeah two point

301
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,279
nine floor is two i'm rolling yes do you

302
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,680
still remember flaw

303
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,680
and the ceiling is the opposite opposite

304
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,639
2.1 ceiling will be equal to three yeah

305
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,959
okay

306
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,639
so whoever

307
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,320
whoever has

308
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,720
casino

309
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,519
wins

310
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,040
so let's say three uh let's say 100.

311
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
let's say

312
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,680
now

313
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,680
my turn okay

314
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,399
50. your turn you can decrement it or 25

315
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,399
25. okay

316
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,320
let's play 25 you're 25 25.

317
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,519
now i said i said 12. okay

318
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
i say

319
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,760
six

320
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,720
six

321
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,959
okay now i said five

322
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,160
nothing

323
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,399
okay then i said

324
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,040
one

325
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,959
okay so okay so you said yellow you win

326
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,279
okay yeah make sense you want to play

327
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,279
again

328
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,120
which one you don't really get it so in

329
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,040
each operation you can decrement it or

330
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,440
you can divide it by two whoever gets to

331
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,680
zero wins

332
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,680
okay

333
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,760
no no no you can only decrement one or

334
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,320
divided by two

335
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,279
okay let's try again right uh

336
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,279
50

337
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,600
let's say your turn

338
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:48,520
same number divide by two subtract

339
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:51,440
divide 25 25. okay then i said 24 okay

340
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,120
[Music]

341
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,040
yeah

342
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,519
i said

343
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,519
11.

344
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,160
i say 10.

345
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:07,120
okay i said 9. i say eight is it seven

346
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,360
six six

347
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,360
um

348
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,639
i say a three

349
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,840
[Music]

350
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,120
how to guarantee a win

351
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,720
in the next few days okay this is very

352
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,639
interesting think about it you can play

353
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,160
this with mommy

354
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,120
yeah you can play this with mommy

355
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,760
whoever gets to zero wins okay whoever

356
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,240
gets to zero winning so

357
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,360
so let's say let's use this simple game

358
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,040
to define the laws for a few times

359
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,639
saturday if it's ended the action

360
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,120
the utility

361
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,680
and the successor okay and then we

362
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,839
quickly we quickly implement this okay

363
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,720
is it interesting this is kind of like a

364
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,720
two-player deal

365
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,839
ryan who knows two-player zero-sum game

366
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,240
okay

367
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,040
and then you tell me

368
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,040
it's too noisy

369
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,800
so let's say let's first first define a

370
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:41,320
class let's say halfling this is called

371
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,320
huffington halfling game

372
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,749
[Music]

373
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,320
okay that's it

374
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,959
so in the init function we're going to

375
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,680
take a n and from n this is the number

376
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,839
we're going to take here so self.n

377
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,000
equals n this is the number we're given

378
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,560
right this is the number like 150.

379
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,079
now let's start again let's the star

380
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,720
state

381
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,720
star state

382
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,800
what's the stars game

383
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,920
the star state will be

384
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,279
returning if i say agent is plus one

385
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,600
right agents plus one opponent's turn is

386
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,600
minus one so it will return a tuple

387
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,920
let's say plus one and then serve the

388
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,920
iron okay this is the star state okay

389
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,880
starting

390
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,920
okay now we want to have a east end this

391
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,279
end if the game is ended right

392
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,360
if the game is ended so we are taking uh

393
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,399
we are taking a stay right we are taking

394
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,639
a state

395
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,720
so the state will be the player and the

396
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,680
number yeah let's say player

397
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,800
let's

398
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,279
break down these the state player number

399
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,279
equal stay okay this is a tupper and

400
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,839
then if you can descend it then we can

401
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,600
say return number equals zero right

402
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,559
yeah okay

403
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,880
start

404
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,120
is end and then

405
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,319
action so what are the actions we can

406
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,199
have what are the actions

407
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,720
come on

408
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,559
what are the actions

409
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,559
the actions

410
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,559
actions what are the actions uh we can

411
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,799
divide it or we can

412
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:28,000
we can divide it and we can subtract

413
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:31,280
okay so let's say divide us subtract or

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,480
divide we could put it in in a tuple or

415
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,120
array okay

416
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,640
and then we have uh

417
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,760
utility

418
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,240
utility there's so much fines yeah

419
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,919
utility we have a state

420
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,640
again this state

421
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,240
is two things it's player and a number

422
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,360
so we we just decouple it player

423
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,080
number

424
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,720
equals stay

425
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,520
right so we need to make sure this is

426
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,240
and uh it's n is already ended right so

427
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,600
we need to make sure a third

428
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,880
the number

429
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,640
is equal to zero okay the utility only

430
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,720
makes sense when it comes to the end

431
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,640
game and then

432
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,760
so look when

433
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,200
when it's ended then i i will return

434
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,840
return what player times infinity times

435
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,320
times mass dot infinity so

436
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,200
so when player is a

437
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,720
agent it will return max infinity one

438
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,039
player is

439
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,160
opponent you will return minus infinity

440
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,160
okay yeah that's what we talk about

441
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,679
and what that was

442
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,559
successor success success means that

443
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,679
the next one it takes a state it takes

444
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,960
the action it takes the action

445
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,919
so we we have a player

446
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,760
again players

447
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,799
player number equals they break out the

448
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,240
state

449
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,180
now we can say if action

450
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,559
equals

451
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,200
[Music]

452
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,559
minus right if it's equal to minus that

453
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,080
will be 10

454
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,960
to return what

455
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,679
minus player okay because look what's

456
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,799
minus player means even now agent is

457
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,000
playing so the the next one is minus

458
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,360
agent is playing if look if minus agent

459
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,600
is playing

460
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,799
you make it negative then you become

461
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
player okay

462
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,440
my case

463
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,640
what's minus one equals what

464
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,600
minus

465
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,799
now now player is one you put a minus

466
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,080
minus one and you put another minus

467
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,799
that's one you play another minus minus

468
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,440
one

469
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,400
minus minus one equals plus one okay

470
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,960
yeah

471
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,320
lastly the next next player playing

472
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,039
right because currently player is

473
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,919
playing you put them minus is the next

474
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,400
player playing and then the number

475
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,000
needs to minus one right

476
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,440
as if

477
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,280
action

478
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,600
equals divide

479
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,679
now we return

480
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:10,799
one minus player and number

481
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:14,000
divided by two okay yeah

482
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,600
make sense what else well have we missed

483
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,720
anything no

484
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,720
uh

485
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,400
sometimes we have this player function

486
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,200
play player function yeah player

487
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,039
function player function is just simply

488
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,880
determine the player from the one with

489
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,840
the couple of state okay

490
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,120
already couple of states

491
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,679
so this is a

492
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,880
basic uh elements of the

493
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,440
uh

494
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,640
the game right so we can apply this one

495
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,240
to the tick tick tock top right

496
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,440
is the thing what's the difference

497
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,760
between this game and a tic tac top

498
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,280
that one is writing in the other one is

499
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,280
drawing

500
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,600
so what's the difference what's that if

501
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,760
i want to use this template to apply it

502
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,760
to the tic-tac-toe what should we change

503
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,760
the stain right the state for this game

504
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,640
the state is the number and the player

505
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,080
right

506
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,720
the player and the number but for the

507
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,080
tick tick tock is the player and the and

508
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,280
the ball right

509
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,280
yeah

510
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,280
right and then it's ending we need to

511
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,559
check the the cross for each rows each

512
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,280
columns and two diagonals yeah this one

513
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,720
is ended for the action

514
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,880
