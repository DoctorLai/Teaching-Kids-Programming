the four some yeah four some
 

9
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,549
the four some yeah four some
for some so given a list of numbers

10
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
for some so given a list of numbers
 

11
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,829
for some so given a list of numbers
one three five two

12
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:15,839
one three five two
 

13
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,109
one three five two
9 10 and 7

9 10 and 7
 

15
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,990
9 10 and 7
we want to find if they are number four

16
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
we want to find if they are number four
 

17
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,790
we want to find if they are number four
numbers

18
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
numbers
 

19
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,269
numbers
these are unique numbers okay if we want

20
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
these are unique numbers okay if we want
 

21
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:25,830
these are unique numbers okay if we want
to find

22
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
to find
 

23
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,150
to find
if there are four numbers adding to like

24
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
if there are four numbers adding to like
 

25
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,310
if there are four numbers adding to like
13 can you can you find it

26
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
13 can you can you find it
 

27
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,389
13 can you can you find it
no no no 16 16. can you find six num

28
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
no no no 16 16. can you find six num
 

29
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,510
no no no 16 16. can you find six num
four numbers adding to 16

30
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
four numbers adding to 16
 

31
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,950
four numbers adding to 16
16. can we be multiples

32
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
16. can we be multiples
 

33
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,630
16. can we be multiples
now you can only pick one number each

34
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
now you can only pick one number each
 

35
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,709
now you can only pick one number each
you know pick the number one each can

36
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
you know pick the number one each can
 

37
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,910
you know pick the number one each can
you find the four numbers adding those

38
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
you find the four numbers adding those
 

39
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,640
you find the four numbers adding those
yeah ten three two one two

40
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:57,650
yeah ten three two one two
 

41
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:04,469
yeah ten three two one two
[Applause]

42
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479

 

43
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,830

but as long as you can find four numbers

44
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840

 

45
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,030

that's not a 16. why is not sixteen

46
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
that's not a 16. why is not sixteen
 

47
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,510
that's not a 16. why is not sixteen
seven oh okay three five six okay sorry

okay okay so remember a few days ago we
 

53
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,590
okay okay so remember a few days ago we
talked about the blue force

54
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
talked about the blue force
 

55
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,990
talked about the blue force
right remember and therefore search yeah

56
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
right remember and therefore search yeah
 

57
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,990
right remember and therefore search yeah
blue force and deficit remember

58
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
blue force and deficit remember
 

59
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,109
blue force and deficit remember
all right okay so for

60
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
all right okay so for
 

61
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,590
all right okay so for
the first number in range

62
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
the first number in range
 

63
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,870
the first number in range
let's say sorry

64
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
let's say sorry
 

65
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,630

range all right j plus one
 

73
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,789
range all right j plus one
and y and can you tell me what's next

74
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
and y and can you tell me what's next
 

75
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,550
and y and can you tell me what's next
four let's say u

76
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
four let's say u
 

77
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,590
four let's say u
in range what what

78
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
in range what what
 

79
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,310
in range what what
what k plus one and yeah very basically

80
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
what k plus one and yeah very basically
 

81
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,270
what k plus one and yeah very basically
we want to loop

82
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,280
we want to loop
 

83
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,030
we want to loop
four numbers that's the first number

84
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
four numbers that's the first number
 

85
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,789
four numbers that's the first number
let's set the number the third number is

86
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
let's set the number the third number is
 

87
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,590
let's set the number the third number is
the first number

88
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
the first number
 

89
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:21,110
the first number
each number is the

90
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120

 

91
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,630

plus num j plus num k plus nums u equals

92
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
plus num j plus num k plus nums u equals
 

93
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,270
plus num j plus num k plus nums u equals
k

94
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
k
 

95
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,430
k
uh equals target yeah let's return two

96
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
uh equals target yeah let's return two
 

97
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,470
uh equals target yeah let's return two
right and

98
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
right and
 

99
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,390
right and
at last we can fall right this is the

100
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
at last we can fall right this is the
 

101
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,509
at last we can fall right this is the
pull force here what's the time

102
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519
pull force here what's the time
 

103
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,869
pull force here what's the time
complexity for this one

104
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879

 

105
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,910

n times four o n to the power four okay

106
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
n times four o n to the power four okay
 

107
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,470
n times four o n to the power four okay
not times four times four will be times

108
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
not times four times four will be times
 

109
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,670
not times four times four will be times
four right

110
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
four right
 

111
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,350
four right
to the power and we can use the

112
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
to the power and we can use the
 

113
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,270
to the power and we can use the
different search right remember for each

114
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
different search right remember for each
 

115
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,990
different search right remember for each
number

116
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
number
 

117
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,750
number
we can choose to pick on our pick

118
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
we can choose to pick on our pick
 

119
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,750
we can choose to pick on our pick
you still remember that definitely let's

120
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
you still remember that definitely let's
 

121
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,589
you still remember that definitely let's
do mine

122
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
do mine
 

123
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,270
do mine
right outside the depth of search

124
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
right outside the depth of search
 

125
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,110
right outside the depth of search
define let's say f udfs

126
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
define let's say f udfs
 

127
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,110
define let's say f udfs
look the left target

128
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
look the left target
 

129
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,869
look the left target
and what remain uh target

130
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
and what remain uh target
 

131
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,910
and what remain uh target
all the thumb and what

132
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920

 

133
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,790

no no yeah that's one parameter missing

134
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
no no yeah that's one parameter missing
 

135
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,750
no no yeah that's one parameter missing
okay so we want to look we only pick the

136
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
okay so we want to look we only pick the
 

137
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,550
okay so we want to look we only pick the
numbers and

138
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
numbers and
 

139
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,750
numbers and
for each one we pick on an account right

140
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
for each one we pick on an account right
 

141
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,949
for each one we pick on an account right
right yeah so look if c equal equals

142
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
right yeah so look if c equal equals
 

143
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,110
right yeah so look if c equal equals
four then we return

144
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
four then we return
 

145
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,430
four then we return
this fear remember if we have quick four

146
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
this fear remember if we have quick four
 

147
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,430
this fear remember if we have quick four
numbers we want to check if the

148
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
numbers we want to check if the
 

149
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,630
numbers we want to check if the
target remaining zero right

150
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
target remaining zero right
 

151
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,589
target remaining zero right
yeah if left bigger than equal and

152
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
yeah if left bigger than equal and
 

153
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,030
yeah if left bigger than equal and
length of numbers

154
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
length of numbers
 

155
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,350
length of numbers
we return what if we have already run

156
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
we return what if we have already run
 

157
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,509
we return what if we have already run
out the numbers

158
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
out the numbers
 

159
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,949
out the numbers
yeah this left instance the number

160
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
yeah this left instance the number
 

161
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,229
yeah this left instance the number
yeah and then we can return return

162
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
yeah and then we can return return
 

163
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,509
yeah and then we can return return
dfs l plus one t

164
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
dfs l plus one t
 

165
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,949
dfs l plus one t
minus if we pick few numbers

166
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
minus if we pick few numbers
 

167
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,630
minus if we pick few numbers
numbers air right and then

168
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
numbers air right and then
 

169
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,470
numbers air right and then
count the plus one right you will pick

170
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
count the plus one right you will pick
 

171
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,990
count the plus one right you will pick
big numbers or

172
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
big numbers or
 

173
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,550
big numbers or
we not pick right we don't pick l plus

174
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
we not pick right we don't pick l plus
 

175
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,350
we not pick right we don't pick l plus
one t

176
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
one t
 

177
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,030
one t
and then c right doesn't make sense

178
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
and then c right doesn't make sense
 

179
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,270
and then c right doesn't make sense
therefore yeah this still remember this

180
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
therefore yeah this still remember this
 

181
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,749
therefore yeah this still remember this
okay there's a lot yeah

182
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
okay there's a lot yeah
 

183
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,870
okay there's a lot yeah
yeah what's a time conversion

184
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880

 

185
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,420

oh

186
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:30,430

189
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,430

because we we are returning when this

190
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
because we we are returning when this
 

191
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,030
because we we are returning when this
count equals

192
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
count equals
 

193
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,950
count equals
four right doesn't make sense yeah okay

194
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
four right doesn't make sense yeah okay
 

195
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,590
four right doesn't make sense yeah okay
do you still remember two sum three sum

196
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
do you still remember two sum three sum
 

197
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,070
do you still remember two sum three sum
and then we talked about the fourth sum

198
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
and then we talked about the fourth sum
 

199
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,310
and then we talked about the fourth sum
two sum three time and in order to do

200
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
two sum three time and in order to do
 

201

we can do one
 

215
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,390
we can do one
we can use the what kind of data

remember how do we to define two songs

264
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120

 

265
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,790

yeah we can use the notebook here

266
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
yeah we can use the notebook here
 

267
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,150
yeah we can use the notebook here
remember yeah

268
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
remember yeah
 

269
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,270
remember yeah
or we can one well we can do what we can

270
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
or we can one well we can do what we can
 

271
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,230
or we can one well we can do what we can
sort the array

272
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
sort the array
 

273
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,909
sort the array
and then have two pointer remember when

274
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
and then have two pointer remember when
 

275
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,590
and then have two pointer remember when
they are equal we find it when they're

276
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
they are equal we find it when they're
 

277
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,710
they are equal we find it when they're
smaller

278
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
smaller
 

279
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,590
smaller
we increase the that point when they are

280
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
we increase the that point when they are
 

281
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,629
we increase the that point when they are
bigger

282
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
bigger
 

283
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,550
bigger
we reduce the right point remember

284
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
we reduce the right point remember
 

285
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,070
we reduce the right point remember
look look at one side give this sort

286
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
look look at one side give this sort
 

287
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,670
look look at one side give this sort
here

288
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
here
 

289
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,150
here
if we want to find if there are numbers

290
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
if we want to find if there are numbers
 

291
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,189
if we want to find if there are numbers
equals to

292
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
equals to
 

293
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,309
equals to
eight to sum yeah if i

294
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
eight to sum yeah if i
 

295
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,550
eight to sum yeah if i
this is the left pointer this is the

296
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
this is the left pointer this is the
 

297
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,909
this is the left pointer this is the
right point

298
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
right point
 

299
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,990
right point
left and right point add together one

300
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000

 

301
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,029

eleven eleven is and compared to a one

302
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
eleven eleven is and compared to a one
 

303
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,550
eleven eleven is and compared to a one
bigger yeah you say you need to move

304
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
bigger yeah you say you need to move
 

305
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,670
bigger yeah you say you need to move
yeah okay now seven plus one eight okay

306
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
yeah okay now seven plus one eight okay
 

307
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,350
yeah okay now seven plus one eight okay
okay if it's smaller we move the level

308
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
okay if it's smaller we move the level
 

309
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,749
okay if it's smaller we move the level
yeah yeah can we apply this thing to the

310
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
yeah yeah can we apply this thing to the
 

311
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,629
yeah yeah can we apply this thing to the
fourth sound

312
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
fourth sound
 

313
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,070
fourth sound
you know in the three times we can use

314
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
you know in the three times we can use
 

315
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,950
you know in the three times we can use
this on the on the third number right

316
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
this on the on the third number right
 

317
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,110
this on the on the third number right
yeah alright two three five what's three

318
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
yeah alright two three five what's three
 

319
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,309
yeah alright two three five what's three
thumb

320
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
thumb
 

321
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,270
thumb
three times we make sure this uh array

322
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
three times we make sure this uh array
 

323
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,390
three times we make sure this uh array
is sorted and then we

324
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
is sorted and then we
 

325
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,790
is sorted and then we
iterate pull first the first number and

326
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
iterate pull first the first number and
 

327
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,589
iterate pull first the first number and
then follow

328
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
then follow
 

329
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,670
then follow
for example if i already pick the first

330
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
for example if i already pick the first
 

331
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,950
for example if i already pick the first
number is this one

332
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
number is this one
 

333
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,790
number is this one
and i can apply two sum in here right

334
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
and i can apply two sum in here right
 

335
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,990
and i can apply two sum in here right
yeah if i make if i choose the

336
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
yeah if i make if i choose the
 

337
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,390
yeah if i make if i choose the
first number here i can apply to some

338
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
first number here i can apply to some
 

339
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,710
first number here i can apply to some
doesn't make sense

340
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
doesn't make sense
 

341
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,270
doesn't make sense
and how about four thumb for somebody

342
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
and how about four thumb for somebody
 

343
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,110
and how about four thumb for somebody
all right what's further how about we

344
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
all right what's further how about we
 

345
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,990
all right what's further how about we
haven't done three

346
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
haven't done three
 

347
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,110
haven't done three
oh let's pick this one let's do some

348
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
oh let's pick this one let's do some
 

349
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,749
oh let's pick this one let's do some
okay

350
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
okay
 

351
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,150
okay
if i pick what's the times i pick two

352
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
if i pick what's the times i pick two
 

353
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,150
if i pick what's the times i pick two
numbers

354
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
numbers
 

355
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,270
numbers
and i apply two sum

356
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
and i apply two sum
 

357
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,550
and i apply two sum
from the on the remaining set okay

358
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
from the on the remaining set okay
 

359
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,830
from the on the remaining set okay
does it make sense all right you hear me

360
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
does it make sense all right you hear me
 

361
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,869
does it make sense all right you hear me
yeah doesn't make sense

362
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
yeah doesn't make sense
 

363
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,350
yeah doesn't make sense
how about fourth sum i pick three

364
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
how about fourth sum i pick three
 

365
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,990
how about fourth sum i pick three
numbers

366
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
numbers
 

367
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,629
numbers
and then i took and i can apply the two

368
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
and then i took and i can apply the two
 

369
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,550
and then i took and i can apply the two
some on the remaining and that's that

370
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560

 

371
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,390

that's the that's the full song yeah

372
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
that's the that's the full song yeah
 

373
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,110
that's the that's the full song yeah
let's make scenary

374
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
let's make scenary
 

375
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,589
let's make scenary
so basically for this this kind of sum

376
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
so basically for this this kind of sum
 

377
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,469
so basically for this this kind of sum
problem

378
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
problem
 

379
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,909
problem
we can do what we can sort it the array

380
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
we can do what we can sort it the array
 

381
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,829
we can do what we can sort it the array
first make it sorted using o

382
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
first make it sorted using o
 

383
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,430
first make it sorted using o
and log n time right away

384
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
and log n time right away
 

385
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,190
and log n time right away
yeah and then we can pick the first

386
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
yeah and then we can pick the first
 

387
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,230
yeah and then we can pick the first
n minus numbers right

388
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
n minus numbers right
 

389
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,829
n minus numbers right
then let's owe a one

390
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
then let's owe a one
 

391
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,990
then let's owe a one
okay let's say i want to do this k sum

392
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
okay let's say i want to do this k sum
 

393
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,870
okay let's say i want to do this k sum
right

394
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
right
 

395
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,070
right
one one one strategy is to solve this

396
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
one one one strategy is to solve this
 

397
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,269
one one one strategy is to solve this
array using if this is this k sum

398
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
array using if this is this k sum
 

399
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,470
array using if this is this k sum
and an element the time complexity for

400
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
and an element the time complexity for
 

401
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,389
and an element the time complexity for
sorting is o one and what

402
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
sorting is o one and what
 

403
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,910
sorting is o one and what
log n right sorting yeah something

404
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
log n right sorting yeah something
 

405
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,269
log n right sorting yeah something
and then for this k sum i want to find

406
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
and then for this k sum i want to find
 

407
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,550
and then for this k sum i want to find
out

408
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
out
 

409
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,310
out
i want to blue force blue force k

410
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
i want to blue force blue force k
 

411
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,070
i want to blue force blue force k
minus one animals okay so what's k minus

412
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
minus one animals okay so what's k minus
 

413
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,790
minus one animals okay so what's k minus
if i want to k minus element so what's

414
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
if i want to k minus element so what's
 

415
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,590
if i want to k minus element so what's
this

416
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
this
 

417
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,190
this
n to the power of k minus one right

418
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
n to the power of k minus one right
 

419
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:48,790
n to the power of k minus one right
yeah um am i right

420
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800

 

421
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,230

n square three sum is o

422
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
n square three sum is o
 

423
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,509
n square three sum is o
and uh

424
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
and uh
 

425
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,110
and uh
two sum is always square maybe it is

426
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
two sum is always square maybe it is
 

427
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,630
two sum is always square maybe it is
maybe not look if i uh if i

428
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
maybe not look if i uh if i
 

429
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,670
maybe not look if i uh if i
if i do this left and then

430
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
if i do this left and then
 

431
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,030
if i do this left and then
right right left and right

432
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
right right left and right
 

433
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,150
right right left and right
that will be that will be o n y or n

434
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
that will be that will be o n y or n
 

435
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,710
that will be that will be o n y or n
minus one so

436
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
minus one so
 

437
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,630
minus one so
three thumb three sum i would have all n

438
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
three thumb three sum i would have all n
 

439
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,750
three thumb three sum i would have all n
k minus one times n right yeah

440
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
k minus one times n right yeah
 

441
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,269
k minus one times n right yeah
so oh oh oh okay so three thumb is

442
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
so oh oh oh okay so three thumb is
 

443
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:25,990
so oh oh oh okay so three thumb is
basically

444
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
basically
 

445
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,430
basically
uh uh if i'm uh threesome so k equals

446
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
uh uh if i'm uh threesome so k equals
 

447
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,150
uh uh if i'm uh threesome so k equals
three

448
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
three
 

449
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,430
three
k equals three so o n

450
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
k equals three so o n
 

451
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,590
k equals three so o n
k minus two uh threesome i pick up two

452
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
k minus two uh threesome i pick up two
 

453
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,030
k minus two uh threesome i pick up two
one number pick the second number

454
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
one number pick the second number
 

455
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,110
one number pick the second number
and then apply these

456
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120

 

457
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,870

no i don't pick the second number and

458
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
no i don't pick the second number and
 

459
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,389
no i don't pick the second number and
sorry mistake

460
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
sorry mistake
 

461
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,350
sorry mistake
so i pick the first number and i pick uh

462
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
so i pick the first number and i pick uh
 

463
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,470
so i pick the first number and i pick uh
i apply the

464
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
i apply the
 

465
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,590
i apply the
two some on the length so it's okay so

466
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600
two some on the length so it's okay so
 

467
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,350
two some on the length so it's okay so
basically we're reducing the complexity

468
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
basically we're reducing the complexity
 

469
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,470
basically we're reducing the complexity
from okay

470
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
from okay
 

471
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,509
from okay
because we know uh o and k

472
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
because we know uh o and k
 

473
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,389
because we know uh o and k
we can do this k sum using k k times

474
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
we can do this k sum using k k times
 

475
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:04,790
we can do this k sum using k k times
loop

476
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
loop
 

477
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,509
loop
right so o and k uh this is time

478
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
right so o and k uh this is time
 

479
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,470
right so o and k uh this is time
complexity but you

480
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
complexity but you
 

481
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,350
complexity but you
applying these two sum on the negative

482
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
applying these two sum on the negative
 

483
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,269
applying these two sum on the negative
the rest two numbers we

484
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
the rest two numbers we
 

485
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,269
the rest two numbers we
we are reducing it to okay minus one

486
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
we are reducing it to okay minus one
 

487
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,030
we are reducing it to okay minus one
right doesn't make sense

488
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
right doesn't make sense
 

489
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,069
right doesn't make sense
yeah look threesome

490
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
yeah look threesome
 

491
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,870
yeah look threesome
let's do this reason for example okay

492
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
let's do this reason for example okay
 

493
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,829
let's do this reason for example okay
threesome

494
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
threesome
 

495
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,430
threesome
three sum if you have three lamps for i

496
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
three sum if you have three lamps for i
 

497
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,710
three sum if you have three lamps for i
in k range for j in

498
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
in k range for j in
 

499
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,949
in k range for j in
range and then for k in range that's o

501
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:33,990
range and then for k in range that's o
and three i

502
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
and three i
 

503
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,829
and three i
i already but instead of doing that i

504
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
i already but instead of doing that i
 

505
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,110
i already but instead of doing that i
can do this one loop

506
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
can do this one loop
 

507
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,870
can do this one loop
uh i pick a number first that's n o n

508
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
uh i pick a number first that's n o n
 

509
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,590
uh i pick a number first that's n o n
and then i i can apply look two sum on

510
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
and then i i can apply look two sum on
 

511
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,790
and then i i can apply look two sum on
the rest

512
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:46,800
the rest
 

513
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,870
the rest
that's another n so it becomes o n

514
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
that's another n so it becomes o n
 

515
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,949
that's another n so it becomes o n
squared doesn't make sense

516
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
squared doesn't make sense
 

517
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,110
squared doesn't make sense
so we are improving the complexity from

518
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
so we are improving the complexity from
 

519
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,829
so we are improving the complexity from
o and cubic to o and

520
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839
o and cubic to o and
 

521
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,470
o and cubic to o and
square

522
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480

 

523
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,389

okay so can we do this on the fourth

524
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
okay so can we do this on the fourth
 

525
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,230
okay so can we do this on the fourth
song

526
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
song
 

527
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,590
song
can we do this on the fourth song

528
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600

 

529
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,910

can you do it do this on the whole song

530
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
can you do it do this on the whole song
 

531
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,790
can you do it do this on the whole song
so how can we do this for something

532
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
so how can we do this for something
 

533
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,310
so how can we do this for something
defined for awesome

534
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320

535
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,670

right lungs

536
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
right lungs
 

537
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,509
right lungs
target and equals

538
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519

539
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,190
target and equals
lens numbs okay now we don't we need to

540
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
lens numbs okay now we don't we need to
 

541
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,550
lens numbs okay now we don't we need to
solve the number how can we solve the

542
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,560
solve the number how can we solve the
 

543
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,509
solve the number how can we solve the
number

544
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
number
 

545
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,389
number
oh we're going to solve the numbers

546
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
oh we're going to solve the numbers
 

547
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,190
oh we're going to solve the numbers
what's the time complexity

548
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
what's the time complexity
 

549
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,629
what's the time complexity
what's the time when we talk about

550
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
what's the time when we talk about
 

551
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,629
what's the time when we talk about
sorting oh and logan come on

552
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
sorting oh and logan come on
 

553
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,670
sorting oh and logan come on
yeah okay okay now now

554
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
yeah okay okay now now
 

555
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,230
yeah okay okay now now
first time so we need to bluff off the

556
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
first time so we need to bluff off the
 

557
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,190
first time so we need to bluff off the
first two number

558
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
first two number
 

559
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,670
first two number
and apply the two sum on the rest right

560
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
and apply the two sum on the rest right
 

561
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,870
and apply the two sum on the rest right
yeah

562
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
yeah
 

563
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,389
yeah
so for the first number i in range

564
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
so for the first number i in range
 

565
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,750
so for the first number i in range
let's do this when n right

566
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
let's do this when n right
 

567
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,550
let's do this when n right
second number for j in range

568
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
second number for j in range
 

569
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,829
second number for j in range
i plus 1 n right right

570
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
i plus 1 n right right
 

571
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,190
i plus 1 n right right
right this is true number and now we

572
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
right this is true number and now we
 

573
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,629
right this is true number and now we
want to apply the

574
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
want to apply the
 

575
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,910
want to apply the
next two number a and b okay a b equals

576
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
next two number a and b okay a b equals
 

577
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,190
next two number a and b okay a b equals
one

578
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
one
 

579
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,389
one
so look here is number i i i pick the

580
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
so look here is number i i i pick the
 

581
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,150
so look here is number i i i pick the
first number here i pick the second

582
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
first number here i pick the second
 

583
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,870
first number here i pick the second
number here

584
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
number here
 

585
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,629
number here
and now where's the third and fourth

586
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
and now where's the third and fourth
 

587
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,030
and now where's the third and fourth
numbers at the beginning

588
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
numbers at the beginning
 

589
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,550
numbers at the beginning
here this b yeah so this is j plus one

590
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
here this b yeah so this is j plus one
 

591
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,509
here this b yeah so this is j plus one
and this is what

592
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
and this is what
 

593
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,550
and this is what
n minus one right yeah so a

594
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
n minus one right yeah so a
 

595
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:41,430
n minus one right yeah so a
b equals i

596
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440

 

597
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,870

okay now this comma x equals

598
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
okay now this comma x equals
 

599
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,310
okay now this comma x equals
the sum equals nouns

600
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
the sum equals nouns
 

601
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,350
the sum equals nouns
i plus num j

602
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
i plus num j
 

603
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,470
i plus num j
plus one

604
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480

 

605
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,189

plus nums what's your number

606
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
plus nums what's your number
 

607
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,790
plus nums what's your number
which number come one

608
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800

 

609
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,230

i already have this a and b okay

610
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
i already have this a and b okay
 

611
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,829
i already have this a and b okay
okay so now this is the current fourth

612
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
okay so now this is the current fourth
 

613
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,670
okay so now this is the current fourth
sound okay yeah but this is sorted

614
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:11,680
sound okay yeah but this is sorted
 

615
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,350
sound okay yeah but this is sorted
remember we make sure these

616
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
remember we make sure these
 

617
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,509
remember we make sure these
two numbers are chosen and then we want

618
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
two numbers are chosen and then we want
 

619
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,710
two numbers are chosen and then we want
to try this

620
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
to try this
 

621
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,870
to try this
we want to apply the two sum on the this

622
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
we want to apply the two sum on the this
 

623
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,550
we want to apply the two sum on the this
one so if

624
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
one so if
 

625
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,790
one so if
x equals equal t great we found it

626
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
x equals equal t great we found it
 

627
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,590
x equals equal t great we found it
retaining y

628
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600

 

629
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,829

wait if x bigger than t what should we

630
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839
wait if x bigger than t what should we
 

631
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,949
wait if x bigger than t what should we
do

632
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959

 

633
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,829

come on if this song is bigger than t so

634
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
come on if this song is bigger than t so
 

635
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,990
come on if this song is bigger than t so
we know we want to move

636
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
we know we want to move
 

637
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:59,280
we know we want to move
we want to move which is going down

638

if this is bigger acting bigger than t

642
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
if this is bigger acting bigger than t
 

643
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,590
if this is bigger acting bigger than t
so what should we do

644
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
so what should we do
 

645
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,870
so what should we do
which i wish i should move this here or

646
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
which i wish i should move this here or
 

647
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,389
which i wish i should move this here or
move the a b minus one

648
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
move the a b minus one
 

649
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,910
move the a b minus one
and a has a lot a add one

650
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
and a has a lot a add one
 

651
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,510
and a has a lot a add one
yeah come on and then we turn away

i need two so i i pick the the certain
 

669
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,910
i need two so i i pick the the certain
number is a

670
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
number is a
 

671
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,230
number is a
numbers at a the first number is numbers

672
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
numbers at a the first number is numbers
 

673
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,949
numbers at a the first number is numbers
b

674
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
b
 

675
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,269
b
and then right now i add all these four

676
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
and then right now i add all these four
 

677
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,150
and then right now i add all these four
numbers

678
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
numbers
 

679
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,030
numbers
yeah x you find the target grade will

680
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
yeah x you find the target grade will
 

681
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,790
yeah x you find the target grade will
return true if that sum

682
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
return true if that sum
 

683
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,990
return true if that sum
look here if the sum is bigger than t we

684
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
look here if the sum is bigger than t we
 

685
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,749
look here if the sum is bigger than t we
need to move the right pointer yeah

686
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:57,759
need to move the right pointer yeah
 

687
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,269
need to move the right pointer yeah
because there's no point in moving the

688
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
because there's no point in moving the
 

689
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,550
because there's no point in moving the
left pointer because it's

690
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
left pointer because it's
 

691
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,550
left pointer because it's
sorted already if you keep moving the

692
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
sorted already if you keep moving the
 

693
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,069
sorted already if you keep moving the
left what happened it's still bigger

694
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
left what happened it's still bigger
 

695
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:04,790
left what happened it's still bigger
right

696
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
right
 

697
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,629
right
so we'll move the b and if it's smaller

698
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:06,639
so we'll move the b and if it's smaller
 

699
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,389
so we'll move the b and if it's smaller
and one so look this is

700
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
and one so look this is
 

701
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,590
and one so look this is
o n o n square and then another one

702
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
o n o n square and then another one
 

703
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,030
o n o n square and then another one
o and q p compared to o and blue force

704
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
o and q p compared to o and blue force
 

705
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,910
o and q p compared to o and blue force
or definition right yeah does that make

706
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
or definition right yeah does that make
 

707
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,189
or definition right yeah does that make
sense

708
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
sense
 

709
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,269
sense
if i look two sum remember two sum

710
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
if i look two sum remember two sum
 

711
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,470
if i look two sum remember two sum
we just remove this hey yeah

712
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
we just remove this hey yeah
 

713
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,670
we just remove this hey yeah
two sum among the three songs sorry

714
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
two sum among the three songs sorry
 

715
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,269
two sum among the three songs sorry
threesome we remove this right

716
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,279
threesome we remove this right
 

717
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,069
threesome we remove this right
two somewhere to move this yeah you see

718
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
two somewhere to move this yeah you see
 

719
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,749
two somewhere to move this yeah you see
so this part is two sum

720
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:35,759
so this part is two sum
 

721
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,870
so this part is two sum
problem this part is two sum right

722
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
problem this part is two sum right
 

723
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,870
problem this part is two sum right
you see two sub uh not really

724
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
you see two sub uh not really
 

725
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,389
you see two sub uh not really
oh so we forgot something we focus on

726
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
oh so we forgot something we focus on
 

727
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,910
oh so we forgot something we focus on
uh we forgot why a smaller a smaller

728
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
uh we forgot why a smaller a smaller
 

729
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,230
uh we forgot why a smaller a smaller

730
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
than
 

731
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,269
than
equal it's going to be right okay all

732
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
equal it's going to be right okay all
 

733
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,030
equal it's going to be right okay all
right while the left pointer is not

734
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
right while the left pointer is not
 

735
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,550
right while the left pointer is not
smaller it's smaller than b pointer

736
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
smaller it's smaller than b pointer
 

737
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,949
smaller it's smaller than b pointer
yeah keep doing it right does it make

738
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
yeah keep doing it right does it make
 

739
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,829
yeah keep doing it right does it make

this is smaller than our kingpin so we

800
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
this is smaller than our kingpin so we
 

801
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,830
this is smaller than our kingpin so we
we can disregard it

we can disregard it
