we talk about
 

7
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,430
we talk about
a string problem okay given two strings

8
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
a string problem okay given two strings
 

9
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,110
a string problem okay given two strings
okay for for example i have

10
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,120
okay for for example i have
 

11
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,150
okay for for example i have
a b and then ba

12
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
a b and then ba
 

13
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,790
a b and then ba
and you are allowed to take one

14
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
and you are allowed to take one
 

15
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,230
and you are allowed to take one
character one letter

16
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
character one letter
 

17
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,750
character one letter
in the first string and then swap it

18
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760
in the first string and then swap it
 

19
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,590
in the first string and then swap it
with another letter in the second string

20
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
with another letter in the second string
 

21
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,950
with another letter in the second string
and then

22
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
and then
 

23
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,349
and then
the question is that we if we can do

25
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,349
the question is that we if we can do
this if we can do this unlimited number

00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
this if we can do this unlimited number
 

27
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,390
this if we can do this unlimited number
of times

28
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
of times
 

29
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,710

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
yeah we can use it in two places yeah
 

101
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,670
yeah we can use it in two places yeah
and we have one f as well okay so how

102
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
and we have one f as well okay so how
 

103
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,390
and we have one f as well okay so how
about

104
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
about
 

105
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,589
about
if i give you more c

106
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
if i give you more c
 

107
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,509
if i give you more c
okay no why is that they told us

108
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
okay no why is that they told us
 

109
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,670
okay no why is that they told us
there's um three and three kind of

110
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
there's um three and three kind of
 

111
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,949
there's um three and three kind of
three and half okay so how can we get

112
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
three and half okay so how can we get
 

113
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,830
three and half okay so how can we get
even number so we can't we need to count

114
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
even number so we can't we need to count
 

115
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,110
even number so we can't we need to count
the number of frequencies

116
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
the number of frequencies
 

117
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,350
the number of frequencies
for these uh the frequency for each

118
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
for these uh the frequency for each
 

119
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,949
for these uh the frequency for each
character and if it's a

120
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
character and if it's a
 

121
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,589
character and if it's a
odd number then certainly we can't right

122
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
odd number then certainly we can't right
 

123
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,390
odd number then certainly we can't right
and if it's an

and if it's an
 

125
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,390
and if it's an
even number certainly we can with

126
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
even number certainly we can with
 

127
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,149
even number certainly we can with
unlimited number of times stop stopping

128

what should we buy this for
 

173
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,749
what should we buy this for
i in what range

174
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
i in what range
 

175
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,870
i in what range
in c top value we can do this value

176
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880

 

177
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,469

and if what how can we write it

178
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
and if what how can we write it
 

179
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,510
and if what how can we write it
can you write it here here what and

180
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
can you write it here here what and
 

181
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,749
can you write it here here what and
here there are three things missing

183
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,310

one come on write it so we are either

184
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
one come on write it so we are either
 

185
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,950
one come on write it so we are either
wait it's

wait it's

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,029
wait it's
iterating the values which are the

188
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
iterating the values which are the
 

189
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,430

uh if it's uh all number what happened
 

193
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,110
uh if it's uh all number what happened
can you not write it so hard okay

194
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
can you not write it so hard okay
 

195
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,830

yeah i and one actually you can just
draw the

draw the
 

269
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,309
draw the

270
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
modulus too if it's equal to one you can
 

271
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,270
modulus too if it's equal to one you can
just do this

272
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
just do this
 

273
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,309
just do this
you can you can omit that module equal

274
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
you can you can omit that module equal
 

275
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,950

yeah we can do this look
 

305
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,509
yeah we can do this look
we can use this we can count it one

we can use this we can count it one
 

307
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,630
we can use this we can count it one
s right and then we can add one here

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,910

update t this is the same thing yeah
 

313
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,829
update t this is the same thing yeah
does it make sense alright so we we use

314
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
does it make sense alright so we we use
 

315
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,550
does it make sense alright so we we use
the s

316
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
the s
 

317
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,710
the s
object to construct the character c and

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
object to construct the character c and
 

319
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,150
object to construct the character c and
then we can update t

320
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
then we can update t
 

321
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,070
then we can update t
means that we take another object we

322
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
means that we take another object we
 

323
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,190
means that we take another object we
can't frequency and

324
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
can't frequency and
 

325
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,310
can't frequency and
update c so you can do this it's the

326
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
update c so you can do this it's the
 

327
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,630
update c so you can do this it's the

because look because these
frequents and this character needs to

364
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
frequents and this character needs to
 

365
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,310
frequents and this character needs to
come in pairs right

366
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320

what happened to the value it was
 

409
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,230
what happened to the value it was
zero it would be zero yeah because look

410
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
zero it would be zero yeah because look
 

411
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,430

how how can we release to this are we um
 

511
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,710
how how can we release to this are we um
i have a two choice for you okay c-h-r

512
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
i have a two choice for you okay c-h-r
 

513
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,870
i have a two choice for you okay c-h-r
and o-r-d which way is convert

514
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880

 

515
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,470

the function i'm telling you

516
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
the function i'm telling you
 

517
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,150
the function i'm telling you
one function is to convert convert these

518
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
one function is to convert convert these
 

519
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,750
one function is to convert convert these
to here and the other one is the

520
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
to here and the other one is the
 

521
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,389
to here and the other one is the
opposite

522
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399

 

523
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,629

can you guess from the name character

524
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:44,639
can you guess from the name character
 

525
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,189
can you guess from the name character
order okay which one is from the

526
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
order okay which one is from the
 

527
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,310
order okay which one is from the
from the character to to the number

528
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
from the character to to the number
 

529
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,829
from the character to to the number
which one is from the

530
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
which one is from the
 

531
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,350
which one is from the
ascii to the character can you guess

532
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
ascii to the character can you guess
 

533
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,430
ascii to the character can you guess
from the name from the function

534
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440

 

535
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,310

so this direction for the character to

536
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
so this direction for the character to
 

537
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,509
so this direction for the character to
number which one which

538
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
number which one which
 

539
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,790
number which one which
function we will do order yeah because

540
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
function we will do order yeah because
 

541
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,230
function we will do order yeah because
the other one is from the order to the

542
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,240
the other one is from the order to the
 

543
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,150
the other one is from the order to the
character yeah that's what you mean yeah

544
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
character yeah that's what you mean yeah
 

545
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,990
character yeah that's what you mean yeah
order gives you an order yeah

546
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
order gives you an order yeah
 

547
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,590
order gives you an order yeah
character gives you a character yeah

548
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
character gives you a character yeah
 

549
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,310
character gives you a character yeah
okay so here what should i do with this

550
