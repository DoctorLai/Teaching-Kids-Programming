1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,190

hello hello mr are you right

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:05,200
hello hello mr are you right
 

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,269
hello hello mr are you right
remember a few days ago we talked about

4
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:07,279
remember a few days ago we talked about
 

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,350
remember a few days ago we talked about
uh the island we want to counter the

6
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
uh the island we want to counter the
 

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,589
uh the island we want to counter the
number of islands right

8
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
number of islands right
 

9
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,470
number of islands right
one yeah one is the land zero is the

10
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
one yeah one is the land zero is the
 

11
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,150
one yeah one is the land zero is the
water right

12
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
water right
 

13
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,349
water right
yeah right

14
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359

 

15
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,589

so how many remember how many how many

16
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
so how many remember how many how many
 

17
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,509
so how many remember how many how many
islands are there we only count how many

18
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
islands are there we only count how many
 

19
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:35,510
islands are there we only count how many
three

20
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520

 

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,750

so do you still remember what what do we

22
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
so do you still remember what what do we
 

23
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,670
so do you still remember what what do we
do the other day

24
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
do the other day
 

25
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,830
do the other day
how can we do it

26
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840

 

27
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,630

remember what kind of aggregate do we

28
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
remember what kind of aggregate do we
 

29
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,750
remember what kind of aggregate do we
therefore search so therefore search

30
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
therefore search so therefore search
 

31
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,709
therefore search so therefore search
so today the task is quite similar but

32
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
so today the task is quite similar but
 

33
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,029
so today the task is quite similar but
we

34
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
we
 

35
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,229
we
are we want to find out the largest land

36
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
are we want to find out the largest land
 

37
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,910
are we want to find out the largest land
the largest of them so which one is the

38
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
the largest of them so which one is the
 

39
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,229
the largest of them so which one is the
largest this one good

40
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
largest this one good
 

41
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,270
largest this one good
what's the size of it four

42
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
what's the size of it four
 

43
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,830
what's the size of it four
and yeah okay so any idea how we can do

44
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
and yeah okay so any idea how we can do
 

45
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,870
and yeah okay so any idea how we can do
it is the same

46
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
it is the same
 

47
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,910
it is the same
this is similar or what you just do that

48
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:09,920
this is similar or what you just do that
 

49
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,750
this is similar or what you just do that
creates anything and then you just

50
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
creates anything and then you just
 

51
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,429
creates anything and then you just
return them

52
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
return them
 

53
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,230
return them
max over instead of counting yeah right

54
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
max over instead of counting yeah right
 

55
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,550
max over instead of counting yeah right
it

56
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
it
 

57
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,590
it
is a slightly big difference right let's

58
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
is a slightly big difference right let's
 

59
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,870
is a slightly big difference right let's
do this okay yeah yeah but but it's

60
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
do this okay yeah yeah but but it's
 

61
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,550
do this okay yeah yeah but but it's
still there for search right

62
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
still there for search right
 

63
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:39,350
still there for search right
yeah it's

64
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360

 

65
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,350

max max then right let's do it max then

66
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
max max then right let's do it max then
 

67
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,109
max max then right let's do it max then
all right now we we we have this m okay

68
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
all right now we we we have this m okay
 

69
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,749
all right now we we we have this m okay
color okay so now we want to find out

70
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
color okay so now we want to find out
 

71
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,630
color okay so now we want to find out
the rows

72
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
the rows
 

73
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,749
the rows
rows equals lens

74
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
rows equals lens
 

75
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,030
rows equals lens
m right what does this mean

76
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
m right what does this mean
 

77
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,069
m right what does this mean
what does it mean so

78
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
what does it mean so
 

79
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,350
what does it mean so
so which one is it which one is it

80
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
so which one is it which one is it
 

81
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,350
so which one is it which one is it
if this is the magic this is m

82
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
if this is the magic this is m
 

83
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,389
if this is the magic this is m
if this is m what's left m

84
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
if this is m what's left m
 

85
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,350
if this is m what's left m
what's left so which one which one can

86
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
what's left so which one which one can
 

87
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,190
what's left so which one which one can
you tell me which direction

88
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
you tell me which direction
 

89
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,390
you tell me which direction
which one is it this one or this one

90
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
which one is it this one or this one
 

91
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:34,070
which one is it this one or this one
this one yeah yeah okay and then

92
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080

 

93
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:48,869

remember them

94
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879

 

95
00:02:48,879 --> 00:03:05,110

and

96
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120

 

97
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,110

if one of the dimension is zero then

98
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
if one of the dimension is zero then
 

99
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,190
if one of the dimension is zero then
there's no point to continue because the

100
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
there's no point to continue because the
 

101
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,430
there's no point to continue because the
there's no landing okay now we want to

102
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
there's no landing okay now we want to
 

103
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,229
there's no landing okay now we want to
define

104
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
define
 

105
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,509
define
uh answer here answer at the beginning

106
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
uh answer here answer at the beginning
 

107
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,949
uh answer here answer at the beginning
is zero okay we want to

108
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
is zero okay we want to
 

109
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,949
is zero okay we want to
update this with the maximum yeah

110
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
update this with the maximum yeah
 

111
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,350
update this with the maximum yeah
previously this answer is to count the

112
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
previously this answer is to count the
 

113
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,949
previously this answer is to count the
lambda of the lens right

114
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
lambda of the lens right
 

115
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,869
lambda of the lens right
yeah but now we want to define the

116
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
yeah but now we want to define the
 

117
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,190
yeah but now we want to define the
therefore search look define

118
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
therefore search look define
 

119
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,470
therefore search look define
that first search so what

120
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
that first search so what
 

121
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,670
that first search so what
what's the definition doing here what's

122
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
what's the definition doing here what's
 

123
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,229
what's the definition doing here what's
that what's

124
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
that what's
 

125
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,710
that what's
what are we doing here that the devil

126
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
what are we doing here that the devil
 

127
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,789
what are we doing here that the devil
search

128
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
search
 

129
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,070
search
i mean what are we doing here do you

130
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
i mean what are we doing here do you
 

131
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,869
i mean what are we doing here do you
still remember

132
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
still remember
 

133
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,550
still remember
i mean what's this function supposed to

134
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
i mean what's this function supposed to
 

135
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,110
i mean what's this function supposed to
do it's

136
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
do it's
 

137
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,110
do it's
supposed to count

138
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
supposed to count
 

139
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,990
supposed to count
to count what no no no we we're not

140
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
to count what no no no we we're not
 

141
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,670
to count what no no no we we're not
counting today we want to return the

142
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
counting today we want to return the
 

143
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,589
counting today we want to return the
maximum

144
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
maximum
 

145
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,630
maximum
land size of that maximum length

146
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
land size of that maximum length
 

147
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,390
land size of that maximum length
so what is this supposed to do in this

148
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
so what is this supposed to do in this
 

149
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,789
so what is this supposed to do in this
case you return well

150
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799

 

151
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,229

it's not returning a maximum you would

152
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
it's not returning a maximum you would
 

153
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,270
it's not returning a maximum you would
return what the size of the land right

154
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
return what the size of the land right
 

155
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,149
return what the size of the land right
okay okay so what does it need to do

156
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
okay okay so what does it need to do
 

157
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,670
okay okay so what does it need to do
take the parameter what does it need to

158
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
take the parameter what does it need to
 

159
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,749
take the parameter what does it need to
take

160
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
take
 

161
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,590
take
rows and columns the current pixel right

162
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
rows and columns the current pixel right
 

163
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,030
rows and columns the current pixel right
and then you will return

164
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
and then you will return
 

165
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,110
and then you will return
the number of the the size of the lens

166
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
the number of the the size of the lens
 

167
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,550
the number of the the size of the lens
right okay look

168
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
right okay look
 

169
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,350
right okay look

285
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,430
neighborland right
that was the deficit right yeah so we're

286
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
that was the deficit right yeah so we're
 

287
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,070
that was the deficit right yeah so we're
doing something like um

288
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
doing something like um
 

289
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,710
doing something like um
answer plus equal you can do a four or

290
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
answer plus equal you can do a four or
 

291
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,309
answer plus equal you can do a four or
you answer equal one

292
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
you answer equal one
 

293
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,749
you answer equal one
therefore search what's the fourth

294
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
therefore search what's the fourth
 

295
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,080

to eat pizza and then what should we do
 

357
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,389
to eat pizza and then what should we do
we jump we should do what um we can

358
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
we jump we should do what um we can
 

359
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,150
we jump we should do what um we can
set the maximum yeah so answer equals

360
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
set the maximum yeah so answer equals
 

361
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,350
set the maximum yeah so answer equals
one

362
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
one
 

363
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,590
one
equals zero

364
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600

 

365
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,070

we're going through each each picture

366
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
we're going through each each picture
 

367
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,949
we're going through each each picture
and then now

368
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
and then now
 

369
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,070
and then now
the next length is the dns with the

370
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
the next length is the dns with the
 

371
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,630
the next length is the dns with the
max what area the dfs function what's it

372
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
max what area the dfs function what's it
 

373
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:12,150
max what area the dfs function what's it
what should we put the left we

374
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160

 

375
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,910

it's definitely what i said

376
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
it's definitely what i said
 

377
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,949
it's definitely what i said
for i we are going to each pixar and why

378
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
for i we are going to each pixar and why
 

379
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,310
for i we are going to each pixar and why
are we defining the different search

380
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
are we defining the different search
 

381
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,670
are we defining the different search
function come on

382
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680

 

383
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,269

next one i literally just said that

384
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
next one i literally just said that
 

385
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:34,790
next one i literally just said that
next one um

386
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800

 

387
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,230

and then come on

388
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
and then come on
 

389
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,430
and then come on
unless one parameter

390
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
unless one parameter
 

391
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,150
unless one parameter
max max of two thing next at least you

392
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
max max of two thing next at least you
 

393
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,230
max max of two thing next at least you
need to give a max with two things

394
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
need to give a max with two things
 

395
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,470
need to give a max with two things
so what's the other what's what's the

396
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
so what's the other what's what's the
 

397
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,870
so what's the other what's what's the
the other value where

398
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
the other value where
 

399
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,230
the other value where
we need to compare the next with the

400
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
we need to compare the next with the
 

401
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,550
we need to compare the next with the
other islands huh

402
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560
other islands huh
 

403
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,910
other islands huh
other ones

404
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920

 

405
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,970

the answer equals next what

406
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:04,980
the answer equals next what
 

407
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,790
the answer equals next what
[Music]

408
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
[Music]
 

409
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,310
[Music]
answer and then

410
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
answer and then
 

411
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,269
answer and then
another parameter what are we comparing

412
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
another parameter what are we comparing
 

413
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,630
another parameter what are we comparing
supposedly

414
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
supposedly
 

415
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,590
supposedly
yeah come on how high is that and then

416
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
yeah come on how high is that and then
 

417
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,630
yeah come on how high is that and then
we can answer yeah

418
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640

 

419
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,790

yeah because this is four directions

420
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
yeah because this is four directions
 

421
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,150
yeah because this is four directions
so look here all right look rc rc

422
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
so look here all right look rc rc
 

423
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,269
so look here all right look rc rc
start with that ah here c here right and

424
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
start with that ah here c here right and
 

425
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,030
start with that ah here c here right and
then you would call this device to

426
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
then you would call this device to
 

427
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,470
then you would call this device to
change all this picture to

428
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
change all this picture to
 

429
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,750
change all this picture to
dll and then return what we

430
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
dll and then return what we
 

431
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,430
dll and then return what we
turn the max

432
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440

 

433
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,870

come on what's this once you're going to

434
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
come on what's this once you're going to
 

435
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,630
come on what's this once you're going to
return d5 is here

436
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640

 

437
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,110

yeah so so what's this return here

438
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
yeah so so what's this return here
 

439
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,590
yeah so so what's this return here
what's the value returning here

440
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:55,600

 

441
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,630

so what's that

505
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:03,990
so answer answer is already four yeah
four and this

506
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
four and this
 

507
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,190
four and this
will be two so two and four oh five five

508
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
will be two so two and four oh five five
 

509
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,949
will be two so two and four oh five five
five and two so which one is bigger

510
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
five and two so which one is bigger
 

511
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,269
five and two so which one is bigger
next to five okay so the answer will not

512
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
next to five okay so the answer will not
 

513
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,430
next to five okay so the answer will not
be changed

514
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
be changed
 

515
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,110
be changed
that island will return one and it will

516
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
that island will return one and it will
 

517
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,710
that island will return one and it will
change this to here okay

518
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
change this to here okay
 

519
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,949
change this to here okay
so what only the difference then then

520
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
so what only the difference then then
 

521
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,190
so what only the difference then then
previously is what

522
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
previously is what
 

523
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,629
previously is what
what's the difference previously

524
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
what's the difference previously
 

525
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,670
what's the difference previously
you just need to return

526
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
you just need to return
 

527
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,430
you just need to return
return what if you want to count the

528
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
return what if you want to count the
 

529
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,460
return what if you want to count the
number of lengths

530
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:31,470
number of lengths
 

531
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,509
number of lengths

532
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519

 

533
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,110

of them

534
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
of them
 

535
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,629
of them
so the previously previously

536
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
so the previously previously
 

537
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,910
so the previously previously
previously here yeah

538
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
previously here yeah
 

539
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,710
previously here yeah
previously we just have to change this

540
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
previously we just have to change this
 

541
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,910
previously we just have to change this
to what

542
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
to what
 

543
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,910
to what
answer plus equal therefore

544
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
answer plus equal therefore
 

545
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,470
answer plus equal therefore
rc then we these will be the number of

546
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
rc then we these will be the number of
 

547
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,509
rc then we these will be the number of
lengths right

548
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
lengths right
 

549
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,710
lengths right
but here we we we don't need this we

550
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
but here we we we don't need this we
 

551
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,670
but here we we we don't need this we
don't need this

552
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
don't need this
 

553
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:13,250
don't need this
and we just need to return what yeah

554
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:13,260

 

555
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,629

[Music]

556

557
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,310

answer plus equal if this is length

558
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
answer plus equal if this is length
 

559
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,949
answer plus equal if this is length
i only count it once right so this

560
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
i only count it once right so this
 

561
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,310
i only count it once right so this
should return

562
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
should return
 

563
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,350
should return
come on what one one yeah because return

564
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
come on what one one yeah because return
 

565
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,269
come on what one one yeah because return
one will be that of one piece right

566
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
one will be that of one piece right
 

567
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,310
one will be that of one piece right
right got it yeah does it make sense the

568
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
right got it yeah does it make sense the
 

569

yeah i see you rc rc
rc is the coordinate of which pieces

608
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
rc is the coordinate of which pieces
 

609
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,189
rc is the coordinate of which pieces
yeah and then come on i know what

610
