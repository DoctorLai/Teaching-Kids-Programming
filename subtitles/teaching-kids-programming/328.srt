1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
hello

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,560
hello mr all right yeah good

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,040
okay so

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:14,920
so given an array of numbers numbers

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,560
one two three four five

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,439
okay so we want to able to implement two

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,039
functions one is to update

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,160
defined update

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,720
with the index to the value yeah

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,600
so these will change the number at index

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,399
to value right this is to be very easier

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,280
and another function would be to

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,760
sum to compute the sum

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,640
of a range

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,160
and from index to index right

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,680
so

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,960
basically we want to support these two

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,960
functions

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,399
what's the naive way of implementing it

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,399
for this one

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,440
if we want to update the index with num

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,559
with the value if this is numb

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,720
what's the what's your approach

24
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,479
come on this will be easy

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,880
you can

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,880
numbs

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,080
index equal

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,880
what's the time complexity for this

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,880
one oh one yeah perfect we're done and

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,400
now i want to sum the range from index

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,680
to index both are inclusive so it's from

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
two

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,640
by the way this means inclusive okay and

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,320
the exclusive is this yeah

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,079
a parenthesis okay

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,320
so example like

37
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,159
what's the number given this range the

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,479
integer

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,439
what's the number in this ignorance

40
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,000
integer uh

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,439
one two three and one two yeah and

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,040
what's the uh what's what's like

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,720
these

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,440
what's the numbers between integer

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,680
between this range

46
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,680
[Music]

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,960
so basically we want to sum the range

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,880
some of the range

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,119
what's your approach for this one we

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,360
want to sum up the range given the range

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,280
from two yeah this is wrong so how can

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
we stop it

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,239
you tell me you don't need to write i'll

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,239
write it for you so what's your punch

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
sorry

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,520
how how do you usually sum it

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,920
you know just something

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,120
yeah yeah yeah so you can write the loop

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,000
all right

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,519
so okay tell me answer equals one okay

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,040
you feel the brown

62
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,160
four

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,680
for

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,080
index

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,680
yeah in one

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,120
okay so what's that

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,440
come on

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,400
okay you feel the blank you must know

69
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,400
okay come on

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,360
and this is the answer okay what's this

71
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,040
what's what well you want to come

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,959
calculate the sum

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,680
so at the beginning at the beginning

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,879
what's the zero okay and the range in

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,680
well for index in one

76
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,599
red yes all right and then what's the

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,519
front index from yeah

78
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,879
what's the two index okay this is a bit

79
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,120
tricky so i put two or two plus one

80
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,120
yeah

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,319
what are we going to sum up with the

82
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,840
numbers here

83
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,519
what are we putting what are we doing

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,519
here get the number what's this number

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,640
what's this number

86
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,799
if the index in if we if it is index

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,760
yeah so what's that index

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,920
index is index and what's the value

89
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,740
what's that what's the value how do we

90
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,560
do how do we call it

91
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,799
[Music]

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,200
okay you know either why you say you

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,799
don't know you know it

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,280
makes sense what's the time complexity

95
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,280
for this one

96
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,720
oh and

97
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,920
so we can actually we can rewrite this

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,439
using the sum function yeah the

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,519
person has list we can just return some

100
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,040
somewhat uh num

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,359
okay you tell me

102
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,959
what should i put in there

103
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,440
and there's a column here so what should

104
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,440
i put here

105
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,880
come on return some numbers what

106
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,840
what are we doing here

107
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,120
we want to sum the range sum the numbers

108
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,479
from the from the full from two right so

109
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,880
some lumps

110
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,680
what should we put here

111
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,960
from

112
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,759
and

113
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
yeah

114
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,680
we're done okay

115
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,080
so the time of next is all in okay

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,080
okay so

117
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,960
so given this number right so given this

118
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:02,000
uh approach let's let's quickly

119
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,000
put a table here

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,639
for the table okay

121
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,440
so that's the space complexity and then

122
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,840
let's

123
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,840
update

124
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,320
update and then there's the

125
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,120
sum

126
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,039
the space complexity for okay maybe the

127
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,080
space complexity for the update

128
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,600
and let's space complexity for uh

129
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,320
sum okay

130
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,800
and the first one our pro we just talked

131
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,600
about the first approach let's do it n1

132
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,560
which is naive okay the update

133
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,440
we will update is on one right the time

134
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,080
is what a one right we just say r1

135
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,080
and then what's what's uh yeah okay okay

136
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,240
and what's this what's that when we sum

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,479
up the

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,759
sum so what's the times unless you just

139
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,360
said

140
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,560
you just said what

141
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,560
what's the terms of message value

142
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,160
number okay what's the sample message

143
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,080
[Music]

144
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,639
okay what's the space in mexico we're

145
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,440
using any space yeah a one okay okay

146
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,520
this is the pro okay

147
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,759
uh

148
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,560
okay so let the space come and let's

149
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,160
okay

150
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,360
okay

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,520
okay so look if they are n

152
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,759
n updates so ideally if there are n

153
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,919
updates and end sum

154
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,319
and operation of sum and one of these

155
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,120
will be o n square which is too slow

156
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,919
right

157
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,600
yeah

158
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,360
yeah i want to get

159
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,840
i was always

160
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,360
owens square right how do you pronounce

161
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,440
this o n

162
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,080
l n square o n square and how do you

163
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,360
pronounce these

164
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,039
squared

165
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,039
o sql all square

166
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,000
any other ways we can do this

167
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,759
any other ways we come up with a data

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,800
structure before remember how can we

169
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,840
come so look this is too slow right we

170
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,759
want to

171
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,280
get the sum of a range but this is too

172
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,120
slow so

173
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,680
what kind of data structure can we use

174
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,550
to make it faster

175
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,709
make it faster we

176
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,709
[Music]

177
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,479
okay so what's that called

178
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,160
start with the p what's that called

179
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,319
well what what what what are you doing

180
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,120
here you calculate the sum and then you

181
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,039
minus that what so what's that called

182
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,840
what's good

183
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,319
in the beginning what's that called

184
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,560
prefix prefix sum yeah prefix sum so we

185
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,840
change this to prefix okay so prefix

186
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,920
will be the numbers can you write the

187
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,019
prefix sum here

188
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,019
[Music]

189
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,720
okay so look if we want to calculate the

190
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,759
numbers between

191
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,000
uh two and four so i would need to get

192
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,440
the sum of these four numbers that will

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,199
be ten minus one right so that will be

194
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,319
so that time complexity for this one is

195
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,319
what if we given this

196
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,520
one yeah obviously because this just

197
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,599
involves the mathematic the subtraction

198
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,479
so look this is a one right

199
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,680
right

200
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,440
but okay so now what's the update look

201
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,879
how do we update it

202
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,199
so this is the

203
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,880
prefix sum yeah prefix

204
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,519
and then how about if i change this

205
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,599
three to four what would you do

206
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,479
first of all obviously i need to update

207
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,399
the num noms using one but what happened

208
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,320
to this prefix exam

209
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,200
what happened

210
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,440
how do we change this if i we just do

211
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
the previous one

212
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,080
yeah i know i know but do we need to do

213
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,040
that again or from the beginning

214
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,040
so what what number

215
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,560
i know i know but what i'm saying is now

216
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,160
i want to change the number three yeah

217
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,519
because we also have this update

218
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,040
function we want to change the number

219
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,240
three to four

220
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,000
right so does it affect anything any

221
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,440
numbers how do we changing the numbers

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
here we

223
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
put this

224
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,760
yeah

225
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,040
the difference yeah seven and i'm

226
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,560
changing

227
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,120
incrementing

228
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,720
all others yeah we're done okay so

229
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,480
what's the time complexity for this one

230
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,160
obviously you know you can do multiple

231
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,560
numbers what's that

232
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,320
yeah you just need to plus one for

233
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,920
everything else yeah

234
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,279
everything on the right okay that's

235
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,850
where done okay so what's the time to

236
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,019
place for this one

237
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,019
[Music]

238
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,800
oh n because this is a one this is one

239
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,920
plus together it's one because

240
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,200
if i change the number here what happens

241
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,399
if i change the first number what

242
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,240
happened

243
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,800
i need to change all the numbers yeah

244
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,480
because they all it's all affected right

245
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,880
so this is alright

246
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,360
look so look it seems that either you

247
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,120
have one or one here or o and a one here

248
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
right so if there are n operations here

249
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,000
any operation yeah one of them will be

250
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,720
two so right yeah make sense yeah so

251
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,560
today our task is to to

252
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,760
make one of these quicker than om okay

253
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,839
make sense yeah yeah okay by the way the

254
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,040
space complexity for uh for these two is

255
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,920
all you know oh ln okay

256
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,079
it's the other one smaller than oh n

257
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,760
yeah smaller than that okay so look

258
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,839
because we are using the prefix sum so

259
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,760
the space complexity yeah space

260
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,560
complexity is not

261
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,120
uh

262
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,279
you know it it's not constant anymore

263
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,360
right the update we need to update it

264
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,680
and then prefix okay

265
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,079
actually we can just use the uh yeah we

266
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,959
can just use one column to represent the

267
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,320
space complexity okay

268
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,399
okay so look

269
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,519
if from two so we can just do this

270
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,040
return

271
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,640
if it's all inclusive you want to

272
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,120
calculate the sum between this range

273
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,640
inclusive we can just look at prefix

274
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,240
prefix

275
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,519
uh two

276
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,279
minus

277
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,519
prefix

278
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,079
from minus one right yeah

279
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,399
from minus one yeah there is minus one

280
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,480
but but if front is zero then this will

281
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,200
be negative right we don't want that so

282
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,600
one way is to add a zero at the

283
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,120
beginning right so if we add a zero at

284
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,480
the beginning then

285
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,240
we don't have this problem so we can

286
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,000
just do this wrong and then we can plus

287
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,760
one here right make sense

288
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,720
yeah okay

289
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,800
so when we change the numbers so look if

290
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,640
i want to change these numbers to value

291
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,519
right yeah

292
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,920
or and all i want i need to do is to

293
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,680
what this is not the value and i just

294
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,519
need to increment the difference

295
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,839
differences value

296
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,600
minus nums

297
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,360
index okay

298
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,320
we call this data yeah data

299
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,079
different i know i want to

300
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,120
change the values

301
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,120
to

302
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,000
the all the values on the right to you

303
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
know cross this data plus this data yeah

304
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,040
make sense

305
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,480
that's what you did yeah

306
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,440
okay

307
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,200
okay now um

308
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,880
yeah okay let's find so that's the

309
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,399
second option

310
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,120
still to

311
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,800
a bit slow because look this is this one

312
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,800
sum o n this one update on i

313
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,160
look i have nine numbers

314
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,240
but you said to get a time call next to

315
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,240
see

316
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,200
and then this is

317
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,360
oh one yeah yeah that's less than

318
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,760
yeah yeah i know but look this is slow

319
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,160
so base we won't have these two we we

320
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,399
have these two functions and then each

321
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,120
one has n and time we want to call it

322
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,079
center of this has to be

323
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,959
n

324
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,720
yeah less than one yes no no not the

325
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,440
space complexity okay don't worry just

326
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,240
the time conducted okay so these two are

327
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,399
the time

328
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,639
yeah these two columns come next if let

329
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,839
your times end what happens

330
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,880
there will be n square right

331
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,800
yeah b

332
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,000
look o n is this

333
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,800
this is o n o n square

334
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,440
yeah

335
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,279
remote is going up very quickly when n

336
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,279
is a hundred is what

337
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,120
a hundred hundred what's that

338
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,200
ten thousand right

339
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,079
yeah it's very slow right yeah you need

340
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,120
to iterate a thousand uh uh ten thousand

341
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,200
times right

342
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,839
so we ideally we want to find something

343
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,920
you know under the end right underneath

344
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,560
maybe here look at log n right what do

345
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,560
you need to try

346
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,959
let's say even

347
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,480
if i want to call this function n times

348
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,920
right

349
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,279
makes sense

350
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,279
i want to call this function n times

351
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,360
because i say so i just want you know

352
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,279
let's make it faster yeah because look

353
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,680
the problem is is that i want to call

354
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,760
this function n times and n times this n

355
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,079
times the update n times the sum

356
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,639
and look if this one of them is n then

357
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,360
will be you're making the complexity of

358
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,720
n square right yeah without a d okay or

359
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,959
n square yeah

360
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,880
makes sense okay so let's look at these

361
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,320
nine numbers how about if i tell you

362
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,720
that

363
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,600
i want to group them into threes

364
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,560
yeah

365
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,839
and i want to have a blocks a blocks

366
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,160
a block which contains the

367
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,160
the sum of this block yeah

368
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,880
on the sum of this block

369
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,120
so you'll be aware of three yeah

370
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,000
okay so there are n numbers so i want

371
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,079
the block size with n okay block side

372
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,880
will be square and how many blocks are

373
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,760
there

374
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,079
three

375
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,720
which is the same as

376
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,040
the number will be square root of n i

377
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,519
make sense because look square root of n

378
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,040
times square root of n

379
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,360
is 10 right

380
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,880
makes sense 3 times 3 is 9. okay so

381
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,880
what's the sum of these these three

382
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,880
blocks

383
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,399
six

384
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,399
fifteen

385
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,399
and uh

386
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,399
okay so yeah

387
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,199
look sometimes sometimes this square

388
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,800
root n is not integer right for example

389
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,959
if there are only eight numbers you

390
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,839
can't find you can't separate it right

391
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,320
into

392
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,800
into three or right make sense it's just

393
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,480
a rough estimation we can

394
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,560
we can

395
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,600
allocate the block size of square root

396
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,440
of n

397
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,480
so why are these useful

398
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,519
so look

399
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:36,240
if they ask they are in a square root of

400
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,120
n blocks right so if i want to

401
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,399
if i want to

402
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,839
[Music]

403
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,320
if i want to work if i want to

404
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,320
accumulate to do the sum range in the

405
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,600
worst case how many blocks i need to

406
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,600
cover

407
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,040
in the worst case all of them all of

408
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,279
them so which is how many blocks

409
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,839
this one no no no nine blocks square

410
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:59,120
root of nine three blocks right

411
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,720
yeah so when we calculate it it will be

412
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,800
square root of n

413
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,360
the time conduction right and when we

414
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,399
update it so however if i want to update

415
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,399
look

416
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,040
look now if i want to change this number

417
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,880
the five to six what happened

418
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,240
if i want to change this five to six

419
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,759
what should we do first of all we need

420
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,000
to change this to six and what happened

421
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,639
here we have changes six and what number

422
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,240
should i change it yes

423
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,240
yeah look i just changed this i don't

424
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,279
need to worry about the rest right

425
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,600
yeah

426
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,440
okay so the time complexity for for this

427
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,160
uh let's say this is the square root

428
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,639
that decomposes uh decomposed

429
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,279
decomposition okay okay

430
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,040
so square root

431
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,040
d how do you pronounce this one

432
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,040
decomposition

433
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,560
how do you

434
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,040
think

435
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,240
don't go wrong and wrong make it easy

436
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,079
okay so

437
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,320
what's how do you compo pronounce the

438
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,320
composition yeah and put a d means that

439
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,000
the opposite yeah

440
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,399
decomposition square root of taken

441
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,440
position so

442
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,720
so look at the the time compresses o

443
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,360
square rule

444
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,199
nude square root of n

445
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,439
sum will be square root of n as well

446
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,439
right

447
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,799
no no no okay i make a mistake this is

448
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,720
to be one right and because we just

449
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,720
update the blocks right one block

450
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,000
yeah yeah look so if i times

451
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,480
all n times

452
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,360
so the time convexity if i multiply this

453
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,080
is you'll be all n times square root of

454
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,480
n right this is better than o and

455
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,880
square right make sense

456
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,120
when we update it we just uh

457
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,480
do what we just update it so you'll be

458
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,520
01 right

459
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,120
yeah

460
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,840
make sense

461
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,840
okay so um

462
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,960
uh

463
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,120
okay so the space complexity for for

464
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,720
this approach would be what how many

465
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,480
blocks there you'll be the how many

466
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,320
blocks are we using so what's the space

467
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,320
complexity what's the space complexity

468
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,679
what's a space complexity yes

469
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,210
[Music]

470
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,240
what's the spectrum how many it depends

471
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,000
it means how many blocks are we using

472
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,000
yeah how many blocks for the space ones

473
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,559
squared okay so it's base convexity i've

474
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,679
just put it here okay one square okay so

475
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,919
basically we just need one okay

476
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,120
and then it'll be one

477
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,160
okay

478
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,720
okay so now uh how how do we map look

479
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,960
this is suppose this index index will be

480
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,840
zero one two

481
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,280
and three four five six seven eight

482
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,760
right right and how do we map these to

483
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,559
index here how do we map these to index

484
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,679
one how to map this to index two if the

485
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,600
m

486
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,000
the block size is three how do we

487
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,280
map these original index to the block

488
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,120
index

489
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,440
very simple

490
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,440
okay

491
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,000
though it

492
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,080
any idea

493
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,039
how do we make zero one two to zero and

494
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,799
three four five two one six seven

495
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,799
eight two two

496
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,440
what what's the comment about it we need

497
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,440
to just do what

498
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,480
what happened if i divide it three four

499
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,039
zero one two all becomes zero right

500
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,120
yes divide it by three three four five

501
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,120
all become one the integer part right

502
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,799
it's not yet two right

503
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,360
yeah six seven eight divided by three

504
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,840
two right two or two point something

505
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,400
and what's this what what's the flaw and

506
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,799
do you still remember yes floor this is

507
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,039
floor this is ceiling right

508
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,640
yes mathematic this is wrong

509
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,559
three point five four equals one

510
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,320
three point

511
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,600
five ceiling

512
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:07,280
okay that's it so we just need to flow

513
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,679
the original index divided by

514
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,480
block size

515
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,400
okay

516
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,280
the floor then your map to the floor

517
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,120
right

518
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,840
make sense

519
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,480
okay so let's try this

520
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,240
let's try this

521
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,240
so first of all you know at the

522
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,320
beginning i just need to

523
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,440
okay that's the init function yeah init

524
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,559
function and we're taking the numbers

525
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,360
thinking around so first of all the n

526
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,679
okay

527
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,360
n will be equals to the length of the

528
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,360
numbers

529
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,240
all right and then m this is the block

530
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,039
size okay m block size would be the

531
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,320
square root yeah

532
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,159
square root

533
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,480
we if we want to use the square root we

534
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,200
have to import the mass yeah mass of

535
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,919
square root from mass import

536
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,919
square root okay yeah

537
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,600
square root of n and we want to change

538
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,840
it we want to

539
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,840
we want to convert it to integer pi

540
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,919
integer part so we can just do this in

541
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,559
that that's basically the flow function

542
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,880
right and now we also converted the uh

543
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,640
allocated blocks at the beginning the

544
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,159
block sum for each block at the

545
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,520
beginning

546
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,400
what does it equal

547
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,799
i'll be giving initialize to zero yes

548
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,280
times n plus one let's make it extra

549
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,760
space because sometimes it's not evenly

550
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,679
uh allocated right because i just said

551
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,360
that integer the square root of n might

552
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,640
not be an integer

553
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,200
and we have to allocate maybe one or two

554
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,679
yeah one or two yeah i like beginning

555
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,919
and then i just need to go through for i

556
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,159
in range

557
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,559
range n right this is the original index

558
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,919
and i want to put it in the blocks

559
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,159
blocks i

560
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,679
okay so tell me tell me

561
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,360
okay so plus what plus equals they are

562
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,760
the numbers

563
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,720
numbers i right so basically i want to

564
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,159
put the numbers at the numbers in each

565
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,559
block right so what did i just say so

566
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,080
the index i goes between

567
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,400
yeah and

568
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,400
plus

569
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,039
divide divided by okay two two forward

570
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,440
slash means the integer divide and you

571
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,440
get the integer which is this flaw okay

572
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,000
divided by the block size okay which

573
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,080
which one which variable is the box size

574
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and um where that okay

575
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,120
and now we have this block set okay so

576
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,960
this is

577
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,960
this is any function the preparation

578
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,640
yeah preparation and now we want to

579
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,400
update after it's simply update

580
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,840
update

581
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,440
i want to update with the index with the

582
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,679
value first of all

583
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,919
first of all i want to find out which

584
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,960
index which in okay so the index look

585
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,720
so i need to do what i need to blocks

586
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,880
index divided by m this is the index

587
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,720
converting the index to the block id

588
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,960
right needs to pass the difference

589
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,440
what's the difference the current value

590
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,760
is value and i need to minus the

591
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,360
previous the previous value which is

592
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,520
nums

593
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,440
index right this is the difference right

594
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,320
yeah if you changing the five to six

595
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,640
this would be one right and i want to

596
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,360
update the block sum yeah

597
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,360
with

598
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,520
with one more right make sense and then

599
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,840
i just need to update the values again

600
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,200
so nums

601
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,880
index

602
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,559
equals value

603
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,960
look these two lines what's the time

604
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,400
complexity it's right on it's written on

605
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,480
the ball what's the time conversion for

606
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,480
the update

607
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,960
which one is it

608
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,120
look at this one

609
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,240
come on yes it's all one

610
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,000
okay

611
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,679
i need to this population is all

612
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,960
o n right because we're going through

613
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,159
the n

614
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,679
all right space complexity o n square

615
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,640
that okay n squared yeah o n plus one o

616
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,440
m okay which is square root of n okay

617
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,120
now the most uh

618
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,880
key part is to

619
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,960
sum the range

620
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,159
define summary okay come on this is the

621
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,679
last part okay some range let's say from

622
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:17,600
i to index j we want to sum the range

623
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,080
given this range i to j inclusive okay

624
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,640
okay at the beginning let's put the put

625
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,600
the sum in here in the answer variable

626
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,960
right

627
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,159
yeah

628
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,480
okay

629
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,880
and then now let's do this x this is the

630
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,799
point x okay let's this is the position

631
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,880
let's put it in the p okay p equals the

632
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,240
position and i

633
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,720
why

634
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,880
why it's not reaching the

635
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,279
j it when

636
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,159
when we are currently not summing up to

637
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:50,240
the we're not reaching the right the the

638
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,679
right most part okay okay so now here

639
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,400
again

640
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,640
this is the number and we have some

641
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,080
we have some which is 6

642
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,600
15

643
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,919
24 here

644
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,240
now if i tell you look look at me if i

645
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,960
tell you i want to sum this range i will

646
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,720
i want to sum up the range here

647
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,360
okay what would you do

648
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,360
what would you do

649
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,279
no no i want to sum the range three i

650
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,520
want to get the sum between three to

651
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,880
seven inclusive three four five six

652
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,120
seven what would you do what would you

653
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,860
sum up the sum what would you get the

654
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,720
sum

655
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,720
[Music]

656
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,400
no no we're given these whole numbers

657
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,400
and i tell you this is block sound

658
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,159
yeah there are three numbers would you

659
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,880
calculate some

660
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,799
how would you calculate some

661
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,360
um i would

662
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,640
just

663
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,279
now what's the difference than the

664
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,039
previous the the first one remember we

665
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,039
have this bros told you somewhere

666
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,000
making make use of this how do we make

667
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,919
use of it we just use that use that and

668
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,320
then we use that to to get the sum of

669
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,360
this block and then just proceed yeah

670
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,559
exactly yeah don't make it faster right

671
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,080
make sense

672
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,039
yeah because look

673
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,360
because

674
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,120
because these two yeah

675
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,520
yeah and most we we are traversing

676
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,279
one block the blocks the entire block we

677
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,600
don't need to go over

678
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,679
each animal in each block and for the

679
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,520
rest yeah these two rest

680
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,279
the animals

681
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,559
and most will be

682
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,480
roughly

683
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,559
square root of n

684
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,880
times two right

685
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,559
yeah let's make it the most and once you

686
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,640
release so the time constant will be

687
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,200
like that okay

688
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,799
the time conducts t why is that

689
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,840
because they are

690
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,880
square root of square root of n blocks

691
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,159
right

692
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,279
roughly okay

693
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,279
and then

694
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,000
for the rest which is not inside which

695
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,080
which is not covered in the entire block

696
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,799
i can just do this

697
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,320
sum yeah by individual number and that

698
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,960
let's say in the worst case it's two

699
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,600
times the square root but it's less

700
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,080
so this time complexity would be o

701
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,440
square root of n that's why we have here

702
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,679
right so look

703
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,559
now we just how do we check if how do we

704
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:18,559
check if it's currently if x is here

705
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,399
and then x plus plus the m size

706
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,120
is smaller than j right it's smaller

707
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,799
than the j then we can use the block sum

708
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,760
right we don't need to go through each

709
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,360
number

710
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,600
in the blocks because we already

711
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:34,159
pre-calculated the blocks

712
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:38,000
uh the sum in the block right okay

713
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,960
while p smaller than j then we say if

714
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,120
if p materials block size

715
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,480
equal equal zero

716
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,799
and

717
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,080
its cover it's covered this block is

718
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,760
totally covered so p plus m smaller

719
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,600
equals j

720
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,279
then we can just add the sum right

721
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,840
answer

722
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,000
plus equal the block size the sum will

723
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,679
be blocks

724
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,760
the block sum of current is p right p p

725
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,640
will be converted to the block size so

726
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,720
this is the box and then we need to jump

727
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,039
jump up the entire block right because

728
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,440
because look we already here we know

729
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,000
this number is 15 and covers three

730
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,000
numbers and once i calculate i added the

731
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,679
sum i need to jump to the next block

732
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,720
right make sense i don't need to jump

733
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,559
one by one i can jump to the next block

734
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,360
so

735
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,720
p

736
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,880
plus equal

737
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,399
jump by m unit yeah

738
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,200
plus even else okay else is that it's

739
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,679
not covered then i have to add it

740
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,720
i have to edit the column number right

741
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,640
so answer plus equal the current number

742
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,039
is nums

743
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,039
nums

744
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,200
uh p right times p and then p plus

745
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,520
equal one yeah we move by one by one

746
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,960
right right am right

747
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,960
return reason why

748
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,440
yes

749
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,600
okay do you really understand do you

750
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,360
want me to test you for a little bit

751
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,679
give you a little bit challenge okay

752
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,840
come come on okay that's easy so can you

753
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,000
explain to me what's this part

754
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:27,799
and what's this part i know

755
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,799
oh man okay so answer plus equals

756
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,960
yeah okay so look i want to calculate

757
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,960
the sum from three to seven from three

758
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,159
here and i look

759
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,440
otherwise if it's not covered by entire

760
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,799
block

761
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,960
then i have to add a

762
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,120
sum three and seven so so basically the

763
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,399
sum would be three plus fifteen plus

764
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,880
seven okay the 15 part is here the three

765
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,360
and seven part is here got it

766
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,360
make sense

767
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,840
yeah is it clear is it clear so the

768
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,640
individual if this individual is not

769
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,120
covered by this block

770
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,520
yeah it's not covered by the block like

771
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,679
in the range all right because look we

772
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,120
want to calculate the sum between these

773
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,440
two right

774
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,559
and it only covers one entire block

775
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,399
right

776
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,840
it covers the entire block then i can

777
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,600
edit

778
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,360
i can speed up the process i don't need

779
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,919
to add the numbers here right because i

780
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,919
already know like yeah make sense

781
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,000
i'm gonna release level over individual

782
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,799
i just get here i just edit

783
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,720
right

784
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,880
so the times complexity i just said

785
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,039
because they're at most square root of n

786
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,840
blocks so the worst case is square root

787
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,399
of n plus an individual yeah really this

788
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,480
individual cannot be more than

789
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,840
2 times square root of n right so all

790
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,799
together you'll be

791
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,039
o square root of n let's let's keep

792
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,120
let's this part the sum of this part

793
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,399
okay update we have to cover this okay

794
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,120
so now

795
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,120
the very last bit

796
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,600
okay so look oh

797
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,480
which one is bigger which one is bigger

798
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,480
sometimes we have these yeah log n

799
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,399
which one is bigger but they're tricky

800
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,640
okay because look this is square root of

801
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,559
the decomposition and we

802
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,240
in the future we're going to talk about

803
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,320
some other trees

804
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,440
some other techniques like segmentation

805
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,960
tree

806
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,360
sandwich tree which is all which has the

807
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,399
old lock end

808
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,320
lock and impulse method yeah

809
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,720
up there and sum okay so can you tell me

810
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,240
which one is bigger

811
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,720
if you don't know

812
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,000
we can always plug in a value let's say

813
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,760
let's let's factor n equals 100

814
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,760
what square root 100 10

815
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,440
okay so what's this number

816
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,679
log

817
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,679
2 to the 100 to the power of 100 2 to

818
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,240
the power of what

819
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,039
is roughly 100

820
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,600
power how many twos do you need

821
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:21,039
how many tools do you need come on

822
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,039
how many tools you need

823
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,600
one two three four five six seven

824
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,679
seven every seven is what two to the

825
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,960
power seven is one

826
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,960
okay two to the power of five

827
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
two to the power five four sixteen

828
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,919
thirty two

829
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,760
or a 62 yeah so it's between

830
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,640
64. it's between 64 to 128 so the number

831
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,679
is 2 to the power of 6000 something yeah

832
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,880
six so it's roughly six point something

833
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,640
so which is

834
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,919
which is faster

835
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,240
which is faster yeah slower than slow is

836
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,600
faster so but still this is quite good

837
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,720
okay okay

838
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,799
my sense today we complexities of square

839
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,440
root of n

840
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,440
and if you if we plot it this is o n

841
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,399
this will be

842
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,480
all log n

843
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,559
this will be

844
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,159
roughly of n square

845
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,600
and oh

846
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,679
uh

847
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,200
these will be more a little bit more

848
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,440
than these between yeah got it yeah

849
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,559
these will be square root of n okay
