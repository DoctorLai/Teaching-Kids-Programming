1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:05,120
right

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
yeah what did we talked about yesterday

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,460
about minimum genetic mutation yeah

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,200
minimum genetic mutations we use the

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,839
breakfast search to solve this problem

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,840
right so the problem is that we given

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,140
these genes right gin strings the chin

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,740
string there are four types acgt A

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,660
pair with d c parent with G right I

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,660
would also talk about why why the gene

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,239
is like that right so look it's a double

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,460
strand Right double strand so look if

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,739
this is side is a and the other side is

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,320
T if this side is G the other side is C

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,079
right so DNA is small robust meaning

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,320
that if one of them is missing your body

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,899
knows how to repair it all right so this

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,340
your DNA carries information right

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,320
calories information it's a double

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,719
strange right and each one has four type

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,460
of Gene it's like finally but it's four

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,579
the equivalent is the information and

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,039
DNA needs to copy copy and this is more

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,140
like the checksum all right so when you

25
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,119
copies he knows he knows if this

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,159
information is correct or not okay and

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,040
we're given this Gene right and then

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,619
we've also given a list of the very Gene

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,720
in a bank so we call it Bank of Gene

30
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,060
right Bank of gin

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,520
so we want to fry it out from the start

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,500
starting right starting may not appear

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,240
in the bench of June but it's very

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,880
charging and when we apply the mutation

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,580
how many steps the minimum number of

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,619
steps to reach to the engine right and

37
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,040
then all the mutation needs to be in the

38
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,439
bank of Gene so one mutation for example

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,820
acct mutation one mutation we talk about

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,200
one mutation mutation the opposite of

41
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,259
immutable right immutable content

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,119
mutation means change so we pick one

43
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,460
Gene and then we can change to other

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,380
three types for example we pick this C

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,259
if we pick this C

46
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,159
right so we have G

47
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,619
a p so we can change the second Gene to

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,899
all three other types okay and we use

49
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,080
the first message uh because the perfect

50
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:13,860
search is suitable to find the minimum

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,340
Steps From the Source to a destination

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,379
in the undirected or I directed I'm

53
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,780
waiting it has to be unwritical and

54
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,060
waiting means that the cost between the

55
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,459
notes the edges having the same weight

56
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,739
because that each mutation costs one

57
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,080
step it's all the same so this is

58
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,800
perfect search and because they are only

59
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,780
a limited number of genes in the bank so

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,080
the time complexity for the prefer

61
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,780
search is OB right because for each

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,300
mutation it has to be in the bank right

63
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,080
this is about it about the preferences

64
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,900
so what's the other search algorithm you

65
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,760
know not perfect that's a search okay so

66
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,940
we can apply the deficit in this case

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,260
right because it's more trickier yes

68
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,400
it's more chicken

69
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,540
you might go to a different end okay

70
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,700
you know that we use the double English

71
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,220
to level by level right level by level

72
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:12,480
so when we find it

73
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,700
the first note we find it which is the

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,500
target is the guarantees the shortest

75
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,420
distance right right because you're just

76
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,900
searching basically level by level the

77
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,540
first note the talking note you find is

78
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,580
the answer the optimal right if it's the

79
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,900
defa search it does not guarantee the

80
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,720
shortest

81
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,360
look if the destination is here and

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,700
possibly another one here right look

83
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,099
when you perform a text message you go

84
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,500
least here here here here you find it

85
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,360
right this is now you find it but this

86
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,480
is not the optimum this is not your test

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,700
here this is the shortest so in order to

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,420
calculate guarantee the shortest

89
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,840
um

90
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,239
such is the distance we can do approvals

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,180
using the deficiency so basically we

92
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,519
exhaust the search we can exhaust all

93
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,900
the paths right what we find is what you

94
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,700
should remain by but we are not

95
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,280
returning because we haven't finished

96
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,220
the whole tree right we just continue

97
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,040
searching searching and here we update

98
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,720
the optimum right so basically the first

99
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,900
search in this case is more like a blue

100
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,780
Force because we have to extort all the

101
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,840
paths but the way you're searching like

102
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,240
that if it does not

103
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,759
that's that's yeah yeah that was such

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,400
the thing here is that when we perform a

105
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,080
differences usually we return right but

106
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,900
here we're not returning because we are

107
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,139
not sure if this is the optimum

108
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,060
am I right yeah so we can apply the

109
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,220
default search in this case right

110
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,340
because the there's number of The

111
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,040
Limited uh genes in the bank

112
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,320
if there is no such limit this uh to

113
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,500
exhort all a paths industry might take

114
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,419
uh longer right ideally ideally this is

115
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,180
not a very good approach but we just uh

116
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,580
showing you here today okay to give you

117
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,199
an idea so in the next lesson we're

118
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,660
going to revisit this using the

119
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,960
iterative deepening search which is the

120
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,280
combined who is the death limit such

121
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,580
incrementally

122
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,580
set the max depth for the temperature

123
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,280
why did you write IDF iterative

124
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,460
deepening such it's like that okay so

125
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,900
let's start with the Step Zero the

126
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,419
maximum

127
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,820
depth is the distance is zero so we stop

128
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:29,100
here and then okay we don't find it so

129
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,060
let's increment the math step to one so

130
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,060
we do a default

131
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,240
we're not going because the test is too

132
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,100
maximum two and we'll go back so def's

133
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,440
limit search what's Steph's name is such

134
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,460
we perform at that first search with a

135
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,960
maximum depth okay theft limit search is

136
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,039
that first search

137
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,039
plus please

138
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:02,280
limit okay that's what it is okay so

139
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,020
okay so we go to implement the type of

140
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,940
search so definite search usually we can

141
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,560
use the recursion and non-recursion

142
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,360
right the recursion is more easier to

143
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,400
implement all right yeah because the

144
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,280
computer maintenance that class okay

145
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,220
first of all uh set the answer to

146
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Infinity right we haven't found it

147
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,620
infinitive Define therefore such we want

148
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,919
to have a star we have n and current

149
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,120
distance current steps and we need to

150
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,000
have a

151
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,160
paper has table to remember the notes we

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,280
have visited right yeah because mutation

153
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,560
if a change to t t might change to a

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,720
again right a changes to C C my change

155
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,600
to a again we don't want left right we

156
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,180
don't want that if we don't remember the

157
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,960
notes we have seen what could happen if

158
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:52,580
we're not remembering this explanation

159
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,440
then we're working out with same thing

160
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,120
yeah

161
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,520
take forever the problem will never end

162
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,979
right because you just walk here walk

163
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,360
down pause and backwards okay so we need

164
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,580
to remember for example we need to

165
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,900
remember this remember this then we're

166
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,819
not coming back okay we're not coming

167
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,819
back we're not coming back if

168
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,259
visited the destination n right so we

169
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,539
need to remember the current distance

170
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:24,660
which is save the answer we want to get

171
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:26,940
the minimum right and then distance and

172
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,240
then return okay you can return true to

173
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:33,780
say okay to say we will record it and

174
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,160
then okay if not if the current node is

175
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,819
in the scene

176
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,500
why yeah if we we have seen this before

177
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,960
then we'll return first right return

178
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,660
first this is the pattern right every

179
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,360
time we check if the thing is in the

180
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,800
headset if it's a visited before then we

181
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,900
do 10 you look at the things in the

182
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,000
notebook if it's not there

183
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,120
what do you want to do next of course

184
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,160
out mark it down okay so I put one here

185
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,880
because I have visited enough right so

186
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:06,780
he allowed look scene dot add

187
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,240
F right and then I'm going to

188
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,460
come to do the next one the mutation

189
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,080
right mutation mute

190
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,080
in there are four types

191
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,840
mutations stencil or mutation okay I'm

192
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,960
just lazy mutton okay amazing what's my

193
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,160
turn in a sheep oh the meat the mutton

194
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,740
okay yeah

195
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,199
yeah they're only four times right so we

196
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,399
talk about how to do limitations at Ace

197
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:39,839
GCT so we can check every uh we can

198
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,979
mutate every Gene right so for I in

199
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,339
range

200
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:47,339
the length of uh current this is going

201
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:49,440
to the index and the next one the need

202
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,660
label right we want to mutate this

203
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,820
position now we take all the characters

204
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,800
all the genes before and the origin

205
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,580
after and then we need to mutate right

206
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:03,300
so all the genes before is s up to I

207
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:06,779
plus current Gene will mutated mu mat

208
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:10,140
plus s i plus 1 to the end

209
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:12,600
okay and of course this neon can't be

210
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,920
the same as s right because if it's the

211
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,300
same thing

212
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,519
if it's the same thing there is no

213
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,940
mutation right look we're just iterating

214
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,440
look acct for example I want to mutate

215
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,540
the second one so the second one has

216
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,720
four Choice AC

217
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,880
GT the original one is C right so we

218
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,500
don't want to continue doing this right

219
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,700
because it's the same so we cross our

220
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:39,000
right one so a g c p a g t okay and if

221
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,640
not equals the original if there's a no

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,459
mutation and then we need to Def as such

223
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,399
that first search now

224
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:49,860
and distance plus one right we're doing

225
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,800
one more mutation and then scene at the

226
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,320
end we need to remove it from remove

227
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,940
remove the S voice so because the

228
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,640
deficit search yeah we have seen this

229
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,880
before we have seen this before but when

230
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,220
we visit this this another path we we

231
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,740
haven't seen this now before so we have

232
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,140
to unmark it for the default search if

233
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,600
you mark it you know if you're traveling

234
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,160
the past traveling the tree using the

235
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,620
deathless search if you mark it you have

236
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,839
to unmark it somewhere okay and also we

237
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,640
have to check if the neighbor is in a

238
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,100
bank this is most important I forgot

239
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,019
this yeah because the neighbor has to be

240
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,360
that the mutation has to be in effect

241
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,279
this is one more criteria and then we're

242
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,260
doing the third research and therefore

243
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,600
such against okay now time complexity

244
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,440
and space complexity for this one is a

245
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,800
lot trickier because we can't is that uh

246
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,540
Bank of Gene criteria if we don't have

247
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,180
this criteria what happened how do we

248
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,820
analyze the time complexity of deficit

249
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,899
we just check look even this note how

250
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,060
many kids

251
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,720
how many kids have it or if there are

252
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,160
two

253
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,720
for example if it's a buying a tree

254
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,860
what's the time complexity of deficit

255
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,620
surgery on the binary tree so is is o p

256
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,260
t okay so we use this notation B is the

257
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,540
branching Factor D is the depth okay

258
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,740
prompting Factor look to function Factor

259
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,920
two

260
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,260
death okay yeah because for each note

261
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,360
you have two choice right there's always

262
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,579
two to the power of C right this is more

263
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,000
General kind of the analyze of the

264
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:23,220
deficit on the tree but for this one the

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,899
three right another three how many

266
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,200
possibilities

267
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:32,880
if the size if the size of gene is n

268
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,560
right so for n if a gene is n size A C C

269
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,839
T for example if there are n characters

270
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,000
here n characters here so how many

271
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,779
possibilities for each one for how many

272
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,399
mutations so I can pick n of them well I

273
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,660
can pick n on them each one has three

274
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,899
choice right

275
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:52,380
each one has three Choice make sense so

276
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:55,140
it's three times n right three times n

277
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:59,399
so this is the function Factor function

278
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:02,160
factor and the T the test test is length

279
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:06,060
of B right the length of B so so love

280
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,000
bank so is O3 times n

281
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,040
to the power of a bank right

282
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,779
this is branching Factor branching

283
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,019
factor three three to the power of n

284
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:19,860
three times n right or n right we drop a

285
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,720
constant maybe n to the power of b b is

286
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,120
not the branching factor or anything

287
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,760
it's the length of the genes in the bank

288
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,459
right because it gives the you the valid

289
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,680
move value mutation okay yeah for that

290
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:33,600
first search the space complexity is the

291
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,880
maximum depth of the tree if the

292
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,260
distance the maximum density and the

293
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,839
space complexity is already for the

294
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,940
deficit okay but for breakfast search is

295
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,899
determined by because we have to use the

296
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,040
Q

297
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,040
okay yes

298
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,160
okay so what have you learned today

299
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,400
what's the problem what have you learned

300
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,740
today and that's it I mean you go first

301
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,519
[Music]

302
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:02,160
yesterday but it deficit yeah so can you

303
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,600
tell more about this deficit search I

304
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,459
mean why

305
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,279
why we

306
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:12,000
well you have this notebook and and so

307
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:16,740
we don't really do the same thing so so

308
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,760
whenever yeah we and every so often we

309
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:24,540
market so we don't do it again yeah and

310
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,060
market and don't do it again yeah Market

311
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,740
unmark it right the first search we

312
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,139
checked with marketing people if it's

313
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,899
visited we can close right yeah and if

314
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:35,160
we find this then we update the shortest

315
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,440
path

316
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,959
shortest distance this is kind of brute

317
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,700
force in a text message manner okay so

318
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,459
it only works in this kind of particular

319
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,380
problem if this tree is unbounded then

320
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,760
this will take forever the ultimate

321
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,260
solution is breakfast such we talked

322
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,620
about yesterday never by level because

323
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,600
it guarantees the minimum distance as

324
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,600
long as we find it right the first note

325
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,300
we find it impressive search is the

326
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,560
ultimate in uh in an animated graph it

327
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,440
doesn't matter if it's directly or

328
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,560
animated okay it has to be unweighted

329
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,240
okay you can be directly or undirected

330
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,279
but it has to be unweighted okay make

331
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,440
sense can you tell me what have you
