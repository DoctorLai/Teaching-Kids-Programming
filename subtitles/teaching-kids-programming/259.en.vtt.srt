1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,429

hello

2
00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:01,439
hello
 

3
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,510
hello
hello area all right

4
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,520
hello area all right
 

5
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,670
hello area all right
yeah

6
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,680
yeah
 

7
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,349

so

8
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:07,359
so
 

9
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,750
so
let's review the binary tree first okay

10
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,760
let's review the binary tree first okay
 

11
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,950
let's review the binary tree first okay
the binary tree what's uh

12
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
the binary tree what's uh
 

13
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,749
the binary tree what's uh
what's the uh the final three has the

14
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:15,759
what's the uh the final three has the
 

15
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,910
what's the uh the final three has the
two kids they have two kids

16
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
two kids they have two kids
 

17
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,310
two kids they have two kids
the each night can have a

18
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
the each night can have a
 

19
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,269
the each night can have a
almost two kids and only one lude lute

20
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
almost two kids and only one lude lute
 

21
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,589
almost two kids and only one lude lute
has no parents and each other notes has

22
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
has no parents and each other notes has
 

23
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,269
has no parents and each other notes has
only one parents okay

24
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:27,279
only one parents okay
 

25
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,669
only one parents okay
okay

26
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
okay
 

27
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,589
okay
okay so if

28
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
okay so if
 

29
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,630
okay so if
if one note if e for this is this is the

30
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
if one note if e for this is this is the
 

31
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,950
if one note if e for this is this is the
primary tree and every level is for zero

32
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
primary tree and every level is for zero
 

33
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,350
primary tree and every level is for zero
we call it

34
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
we call it
 

35
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,310
we call it
perfect yeah perfect by anything yeah

36
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
perfect yeah perfect by anything yeah
 

37
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,350
perfect yeah perfect by anything yeah
okay

38
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
okay
 

39
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,310
okay
if a final tree is fulfilled every level

40
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
if a final tree is fulfilled every level
 

41
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,549
if a final tree is fulfilled every level
is that possibly the lowest one but the

42
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
is that possibly the lowest one but the
 

43
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,389
is that possibly the lowest one but the
lowest one

44
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
lowest one
 

45
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,630
lowest one
can only be fulfilled from left to right

46
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
can only be fulfilled from left to right
 

47
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,150
can only be fulfilled from left to right
then we call it

48
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
then we call it
 

49
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,229
then we call it
complete binary okay complete the

50
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
complete binary okay complete the
 

51
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,470
complete binary okay complete the
country so but is this a complete binary

52
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
country so but is this a complete binary
 

53
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,189
country so but is this a complete binary
no

54
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
no
 

55
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,229
no
why is that

56
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
why is that
 

57
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,270
why is that
because

58
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
because
 

59
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,070
because
it's there's a gap between yeah the last

60
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
it's there's a gap between yeah the last
 

61
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,070
it's there's a gap between yeah the last
level needs to be

62
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
level needs to be
 

63
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,950
level needs to be
yeah fulfilled from left to right and is

64
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
yeah fulfilled from left to right and is
 

65
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,670
yeah fulfilled from left to right and is
uh these

66
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
uh these
 

67
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,870
uh these
uh

68
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
uh
 

69
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,749
uh
how can we uh let's say

70
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
how can we uh let's say
 

71
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,109
how can we uh let's say
is lisa

72
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
is lisa
 

73
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,990
is lisa
complete the planetary or fulfill uh or

74
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
complete the planetary or fulfill uh or
 

75
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,550
complete the planetary or fulfill uh or
copyright you know yes or not right

76
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
copyright you know yes or not right
 

77
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,030
copyright you know yes or not right
because every level needs to fulfill but

78
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
because every level needs to fulfill but
 

79
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,190
because every level needs to fulfill but
and the last level needs to be fulfilled

80
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
and the last level needs to be fulfilled
 

81
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,350
and the last level needs to be fulfilled
from left to right okay we got it okay

82
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
from left to right okay we got it okay
 

83
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,870
from left to right okay we got it okay
so uh what's the final research tree

84
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880

 

85
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,990

um

86
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
um
 

87
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,390
um
it's just like

88
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
it's just like
 

89
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,429
it's just like
a normal thing and what's the what's

90
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
a normal thing and what's the what's
 

91
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,510
a normal thing and what's the what's
special about it the primary surgery and

92
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
special about it the primary surgery and
 

93
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,870
special about it the primary surgery and
the parent networking with parents

94
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880

 

95
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,149

right

96
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
right
 

97
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,230
right
the right needs to be bigger than their

98
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
the right needs to be bigger than their
 

99
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,310
the right needs to be bigger than their
parents and that needs to be smaller

100
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
parents and that needs to be smaller
 

101
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,630
parents and that needs to be smaller
than the parents here so when we search

102
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
than the parents here so when we search
 

103
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,109
than the parents here so when we search
locate the value either try to set your

104
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
locate the value either try to set your
 

105
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,350
locate the value either try to set your
value in the financial street we can we

106
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
value in the financial street we can we
 

107
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,270
value in the financial street we can we
can compare the current value if we like

108
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
can compare the current value if we like
 

109
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,190
can compare the current value if we like
we want to find a 5.

110
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
we want to find a 5.
 

111
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,950
we want to find a 5.
it's smaller than the root so we know

112
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
it's smaller than the root so we know
 

113
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,869
it's smaller than the root so we know
it's somewhere in the left tree right i

114
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
it's somewhere in the left tree right i
 

115
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,949
it's somewhere in the left tree right i
will keep walking every time if this

116
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
will keep walking every time if this
 

117
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,710
will keep walking every time if this
binary structure is balanced yeah

118
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,720
binary structure is balanced yeah
 

119
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,430
binary structure is balanced yeah
balance quite you know it's balanced the

120
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
balance quite you know it's balanced the
 

121
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,190
balance quite you know it's balanced the
height difference between any two nodes

122
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
height difference between any two nodes
 

123
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,350
height difference between any two nodes
is smaller than one smaller equal right

124
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
is smaller than one smaller equal right
 

125
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,430
is smaller than one smaller equal right
now with every time we do this

126
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
now with every time we do this
 

127
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,390
now with every time we do this
comparison

128
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
comparison
 

129
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,270
comparison
we can drop half of it right so what's

130
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
we can drop half of it right so what's
 

131
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,750
we can drop half of it right so what's
the time complexity of locating the

132
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
the time complexity of locating the
 

133
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,270
the time complexity of locating the
old log and we're done because every

134
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
old log and we're done because every
 

135
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,270
old log and we're done because every
time we drop half okay

136
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
time we drop half okay
 

137
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,670
time we drop half okay
down okay so now we talk about hip

138
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
down okay so now we talk about hip
 

139
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,190
down okay so now we talk about hip
remember the hip

140
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
remember the hip
 

141
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,990
remember the hip
hip is a binary data structure you know

142
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
hip is a binary data structure you know
 

143
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,910
hip is a binary data structure you know
a balance or we call it yeah balance

144
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
a balance or we call it yeah balance
 

145
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,470
a balance or we call it yeah balance
it's and we have two kinds of hips max

146
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
it's and we have two kinds of hips max
 

147
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,589
it's and we have two kinds of hips max
head and mean hip

148
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599
head and mean hip
 

149
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,470
head and mean hip
okay the max hip so a hundred

150
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
okay the max hip so a hundred
 

151
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,750
okay the max hip so a hundred
ten

152
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
ten
 

153
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,350
ten
twenty

154
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
twenty
 

155
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,790
twenty
five six

156
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
five six
 

157
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,509
five six
six that's okay that's okay and then we

158
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
six that's okay that's okay and then we
 

159
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,110
six that's okay that's okay and then we
call it seven

160
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
call it seven
 

161
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,470
call it seven
eight okay

162
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
eight okay
 

163
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,070
eight okay
so what's special about max so the root

164
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
so what's special about max so the root
 

165
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,750
so what's special about max so the root
the parent

166
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
the parent
 

167
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,990
the parent
is bigger than the kid

168
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
is bigger than the kid
 

169
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,910
is bigger than the kid
okay then we call it maxi

170
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
okay then we call it maxi
 

171
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,430
okay then we call it maxi
and the what's main thing

172
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440

 

173
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,949

the opposite is smaller right one two

174
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
the opposite is smaller right one two
 

175
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,589
the opposite is smaller right one two
three and it'll be four

176
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
three and it'll be four
 

177
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,869
three and it'll be four
five

178
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
five
 

179
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,710
five
six seven okay

180
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
six seven okay
 

181
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,350
six seven okay
so the parent is always smaller than the

182
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
so the parent is always smaller than the
 

183
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,149
so the parent is always smaller than the
kid

184
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
kid
 

185
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,789
kid
so what's special about asymmetric the

186
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
so what's special about asymmetric the
 

187
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,509
so what's special about asymmetric the
time complexity to retrieve the max or

188
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
time complexity to retrieve the max or
 

189
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,949
time complexity to retrieve the max or
mean the root

190
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
mean the root
 

191
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,869
mean the root
is one okay

192
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
is one okay
 

193
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,550
is one okay
it's a one okay so we want to build

194
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
it's a one okay so we want to build
 

195
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,589
it's a one okay so we want to build
a heap

196
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
a heap
 

197
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,430
a heap
why we want to use the heat because we

198
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
why we want to use the heat because we
 

199
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,190
why we want to use the heat because we
want to make

200
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
want to make
 

201
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,430
want to make
we want to take advantage of these you

202
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
we want to take advantage of these you
 

203
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,670
we want to take advantage of these you
know the constant time to retrieve the

204
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
know the constant time to retrieve the
 

205
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,190
know the constant time to retrieve the
data

206
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
data
 

207
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,869
data
from the root which is which could be

208
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
from the root which is which could be
 

209
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,550
from the root which is which could be
max or hit me

210
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
max or hit me
 

211
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,390
max or hit me
and to maintain it for example if we

212
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
and to maintain it for example if we
 

213
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,390
and to maintain it for example if we
want to put the value

214
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
want to put the value
 

215
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,470
want to put the value
inside it if we want to insert the value

216
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
inside it if we want to insert the value
 

217
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,789
inside it if we want to insert the value
inside the heap or taking a value

218
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
inside the heap or taking a value
 

219
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,350
inside the heap or taking a value
outside of him or deleting a

220
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
outside of him or deleting a
 

221
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,789
outside of him or deleting a
data

222
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
data
 

223
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,030
data
element of uh from the hip what's the

224
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
element of uh from the hip what's the
 

225
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,910
element of uh from the hip what's the
time connection can you think about

226
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
time connection can you think about
 

227
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,990
time connection can you think about
the in the worst case can you guess make

228
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
the in the worst case can you guess make
 

229
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,789
the in the worst case can you guess make
a case make a guess if we only if we put

230
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
a case make a guess if we only if we put
 

231
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,749
a case make a guess if we only if we put
like a 200 here how can we do it

232
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
like a 200 here how can we do it
 

233
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,030
like a 200 here how can we do it
if we take one out of it what can the

234
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
if we take one out of it what can the
 

235
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,909
if we take one out of it what can the
time come next

236
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919

 

237
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,749

it doesn't matter for the max if we only

238
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
it doesn't matter for the max if we only
 

239
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,350
it doesn't matter for the max if we only
put a 200 here

240
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
put a 200 here
 

241
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,430
put a 200 here
so you can imagine there will be a

242
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
so you can imagine there will be a
 

243
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,230
so you can imagine there will be a
restructure of this right yeah

244
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
restructure of this right yeah
 

245
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,030
restructure of this right yeah
so

246
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
so
 

247
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,270
so
could be if we put we're comparing we

248
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
could be if we put we're comparing we
 

249
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,270
could be if we put we're comparing we
sometimes we need to pop you know swap

250
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
sometimes we need to pop you know swap
 

251
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,430
sometimes we need to pop you know swap
the parents with a kid and swapping out

252
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
the parents with a kid and swapping out
 

253
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,070
the parents with a kid and swapping out
of the until we reach the root right so

254
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
of the until we reach the root right so
 

255
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,430
of the until we reach the root right so
the time capacity will be o log n right

256
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
the time capacity will be o log n right
 

257
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,629
the time capacity will be o log n right
yeah to delete it as well if we delete

258
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
yeah to delete it as well if we delete
 

259
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,510
yeah to delete it as well if we delete
some

260
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
some
 

261
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,230
some
uh

262
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
uh
 

263
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,629
uh
the best cases is what if we just delete

264
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
the best cases is what if we just delete
 

265
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,710
the best cases is what if we just delete
this one this is the leaf now we'll just

266
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
this one this is the leaf now we'll just
 

267
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,790
this one this is the leaf now we'll just
delete it that would be one right

268
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
delete it that would be one right
 

269
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,070
delete it that would be one right
but if we want to delete the loot

270
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
but if we want to delete the loot
 

271
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,909
but if we want to delete the loot
like if we wanted to do we need to do

272
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
like if we wanted to do we need to do
 

273
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,189
like if we wanted to do we need to do
some rearrangement right yeah

274
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
some rearrangement right yeah
 

275
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,350
some rearrangement right yeah
sometimes involving swapping the parents

276
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
sometimes involving swapping the parents
 

277
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,029
sometimes involving swapping the parents
with the kids so the time come back

278
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
with the kids so the time come back
 

279
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,510
with the kids so the time come back
still be like overlooked and as well

280
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
still be like overlooked and as well
 

281
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,629
still be like overlooked and as well
okay but

282
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
okay but
 

283
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,830
okay but
these are quite a complex uh algorithm

284
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
these are quite a complex uh algorithm
 

285
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,029
these are quite a complex uh algorithm
right so

286
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
right so
 

287
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,469
right so
we will not cover today but you need to

288
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
we will not cover today but you need to
 

289
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,749
we will not cover today but you need to
get this general idea of this uh to

290
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
get this general idea of this uh to
 

291
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,270
get this general idea of this uh to
maintain

292
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
maintain
 

293
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,629
maintain
maintain a hip usually takes all log n

294
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
maintain a hip usually takes all log n
 

295
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,670
maintain a hip usually takes all log n
to

296
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
to
 

297
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,189
to
add a new element in or to

298
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
add a new element in or to
 

299
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,189
add a new element in or to
remove the element for example if i want

300
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
remove the element for example if i want
 

301
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,150
remove the element for example if i want
to add a another element like uh maximum

302
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
to add a another element like uh maximum
 

303
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,830
to add a another element like uh maximum
like one and i can just put it here

304
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
like one and i can just put it here
 

305
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,150
like one and i can just put it here
right without without restructuring the

306
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
right without without restructuring the
 

307
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,870
right without without restructuring the
main uh the mind hip right they look we

308
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
main uh the mind hip right they look we
 

309
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,870
main uh the mind hip right they look we
just put it there the terminal xt will

310
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
just put it there the terminal xt will
 

311
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,830
just put it there the terminal xt will
be just a one right yeah

312
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
be just a one right yeah
 

313
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,189
be just a one right yeah
okay so that's the

314
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
okay so that's the
 

315
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,590
okay so that's the
why are we using the heat okay

316
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
why are we using the heat okay
 

317
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,909
why are we using the heat okay
so how can we store the hip in

318
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
so how can we store the hip in
 

319
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,670
so how can we store the hip in
in an array

320
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
in an array
 

321
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,309
in an array
for example like this zero

322
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
for example like this zero
 

323
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,350
for example like this zero
one

324
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
one
 

325
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,710
one
two

326
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
two
 

327
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,670
two
three

328
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
three
 

329
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,550
three
four

330
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
four
 

331
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,070
four
five

332
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
five
 

333
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,790
five
six how can we store this in the array

334
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
six how can we store this in the array
 

335
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,830
six how can we store this in the array
do one two three four by six oh yeah

336
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
do one two three four by six oh yeah

okay for example two times two what look
 

401
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,350
okay for example two times two what look
two times two plus one is five why you

402
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
two times two plus one is five why you
 

403
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,589
two times two plus one is five why you
said plus one plus one is here

404
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
said plus one plus one is here
 

405
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,990
said plus one plus one is here
correct two times two plus one two times

406
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
correct two times two plus one two times
 

407
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,830
correct two times two plus one two times

all right yeah okay so given the heap

410
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
all right yeah okay so given the heap
 

411
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,029
all right yeah okay so given the heap
maximum let's say today start giving a

maximum let's say today start giving a

we want to verify

00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
we want to verify
 

417
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,869
we want to verify
if it's a max max heap okay because for

418
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
if it's a max max heap okay because for
 

419
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,029
if it's a max max heap okay because for
each morphology method

each morphology method
 

421
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,869
each morphology method
is that each numbers each pair each node

422
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
is that each numbers each pair each node
 

423
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,950
is that each numbers each pair each node
is always bigger than the

is always bigger than the
 

425
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,710
is always bigger than the
uh kids right

426
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
uh kids right
 

427
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,270
uh kids right
yeah will using the index okay so how

428
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
yeah will using the index okay so how
 

429
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,350
yeah will using the index okay so how
can we do this

430
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360

 

431
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,790

507
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,710
if it's the opposite
we want to check first that because we

508
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
we want to check first that because we
 

509
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,230
we want to check first that because we
for each for each lam's i needs to be

510
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
for each for each lam's i needs to be
 

511
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,949
for each for each lam's i needs to be
bigger than numbs i plus two plus times

512
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
bigger than numbs i plus two plus times
 

513
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,790
bigger than numbs i plus two plus times
two plus one and we also need to check

514
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
two plus one and we also need to check
 

515
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,269
two plus one and we also need to check
if the

516
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
if the
 

517
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,470
if the
if i smaller than what's like it

518
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480

 

519
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,150

what's the right kid

520
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160

 

521
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:33,190

um

522
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200

 

523
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,430

okay so there's a small problem is that

524
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
okay so there's a small problem is that
 

525
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,310
okay so there's a small problem is that
sometimes these does not exist it's kids

526
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
sometimes these does not exist it's kids
 

527
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,030
sometimes these does not exist it's kids
there's no it's left or right it doesn't

528
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
there's no it's left or right it doesn't
 

529
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,829
there's no it's left or right it doesn't
exist so we need to check if this index

530
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
exist so we need to check if this index
 

531
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,430
exist so we need to check if this index
is smaller than n right so we need to

532
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
is smaller than n right so we need to
 

533
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,030
is smaller than n right so we need to
put a another n here so if if what i

534
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
put a another n here so if if what i
 

535
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,310
put a another n here so if if what i
times two

536
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
times two
 

537
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,470
times two
plus one is smaller than n

538
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
plus one is smaller than n
 

539
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,350
plus one is smaller than n
and

540
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
and
 

541
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,470
and
right

542
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
right
 

543
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,389
right
okay and then here

544
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
okay and then here
 

545
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,230
okay and then here
if i turns to

546
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
if i turns to
 

547
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,190
if i turns to
plus two smaller than n if the right kid

548
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
plus two smaller than n if the right kid
 

549
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,350
plus two smaller than n if the right kid
if we have the right kid

550
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
if we have the right kid
 

551
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,470
if we have the right kid
and also the loot is smaller than the

552
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
and also the loot is smaller than the
 

553
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,069
and also the loot is smaller than the
kids then we determine got it make sense

554
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
kids then we determine got it make sense
 

555
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:27,430
kids then we determine got it make sense
yeah what's the time complexity

556
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440

 

557
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,829
