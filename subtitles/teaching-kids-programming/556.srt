1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
right

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,360
okay so you've known the maze right the

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,820
maze yeah

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,820
yeah we talk about the main problem many

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,580
times finding leaves past shot his paths

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,440
from the engine to any exit right or we

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,380
can use the professor to use the deficit

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,380
so that problem we are given the maze

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,500
the maze won't change and we're given

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:32,340
this exit here and then entering here

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,340
right entering exit

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,360
yeah but there's no exit

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,520
executed yeah yeah but you can't get

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,039
there because because the door was

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,800
blocked okay in front of the image okay

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,260
all advice that I feel and then that's

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,360
literally a super easy maze yeah I know

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,440
because they know their dance okay so

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,070
here yeah

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,739
and then

21
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,799
[Music]

22
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:09,000
a kind of maze it's a different type of

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:12,119
Maze and for example this one you put a

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,020
gap there and they get there yeah and

25
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,020
then you can you see

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,680
like that and then and how I would do

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,259
whoops like that and then I'll put some

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,240
some different ways

29
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,979
so so it's not only one so for example I

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,640
might put that

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,640
um I might put

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,290
um

33
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,290
[Music]

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,040
like that okay

35
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,880
but also you need to fill in that energy

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,880
so yeah

37
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,360
yeah I see I see okay okay let's see

38
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:04,140
interesting okay he's done and accurate

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:08,540
to generate a maze okay so this is the

40
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,540
ambiguous question can it be like this

41
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,560
can be like this

42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,480
oh this is simply it's a mess okay yeah

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,080
it's amazing yeah so that's a good

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,680
question that's good so in a in a box

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,560
yeah I know we want to design a maze

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,239
this is an ambiguous question so we need

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,280
to ask the questions why do you keep

48
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,680
saying ambiguous because I just said

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,360
design and icon I didn't say how right

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,819
you know what what is the requirement

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,739
and we need to ask a lot of these

52
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,480
questions okay what kind of question

53
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,360
would you ask you need to know before

54
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,580
you design the maze design Ackerman that

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,459
could generally amaze what kind of

56
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,500
precious what type of mates does it have

57
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,780
to be that's a good question what type

58
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,379
of maze yes this could be the one with

59
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,900
just squares and the ones with parts

60
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,760
squares

61
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,819
yeah this is square everything is

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,840
squares no

63
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,840
one like this

64
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,500
okay that's good okay yeah yeah okay so

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,599
actually these two are convertible right

66
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,840
are convertible okay so let's focus on

67
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,239
this one yeah it's a square and okay to

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,580
simplify if it's one if it's a you know

69
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,040
two dimensional array right metric if

70
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,140
it's one it means that it's a war if

71
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,080
it's zero it means that empty okay you

72
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:38,099
can work okay okay so let's design a

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,319
square maze with one which is more zero

74
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,000
is empty cell and

75
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,239
what's next

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,480
so just type them randomly you just put

77
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,180
it randomly like pick or not pick pick a

78
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,099
nappy yes but pick up nothing you could

79
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,519
be a very random picture right random

80
00:03:53,099 --> 00:04:00,440
Square how do you know if it's a maze

81
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,440
uh we we try

82
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,620
to try our knife

83
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:10,200
possible okay so your solution is that

84
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,780
randomly General y one and then we check

85
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,780
if it's nice huh that could be one way

86
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,359
right so we generate so we generally

87
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,280
random you know whatever it could be

88
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,299
amazed or could be not amazing and I

89
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,540
will check if it's amazing if it's

90
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:27,000
amazing right yeah next one was about

91
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,740
doing them thing is not guaranteed to be

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,120
amazed and it could be you generate like

93
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,180
a thousand times and it's still not

94
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,880
amazing what would you do we delete some

95
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,419
how do you do this

96
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,580
we use Hulk smash okay so you're saying

97
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,160
that we generate the Maze We generally a

98
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,280
random square if it's not made some some

99
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,639
words yeah oh that could work right okay

100
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,160
this is one way okay is that an easy way

101
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,900
to do it it's a square maze along we

102
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,880
want the dimension right the rows and

103
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,820
columns right we obviously need to know

104
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,180
how big is the mate all right we need to

105
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,360
know how many valid cars yeah that could

106
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,300
be one hour parameters Valley path

107
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,479
sometimes a maze does not have any valid

108
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,580
path right that could be still a maze so

109
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,979
can we think the opposite Instagram

110
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,740
randomly generating right which by the

111
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:22,979
way is a good thinking right very fast

112
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:27,720
so can we think of these the opposite

113
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:31,740
way so you think of a pop yeah okay so

114
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,259
we first draw the path yes let's say we

115
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,300
drove a path like like we can draw a

116
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:40,020
path like that and then and then add

117
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,860
some add some other stuff to it

118
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:46,860
as as some Alistar what other stuff like

119
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,720
Wolves yeah it's water so many times

120
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,240
remember we are given this for example

121
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,860
if you want to generate a maze with only

122
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,320
one part then we learned that they

123
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,699
generate this path okay here all right

124
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,759
this part okay

125
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:03,600
this is the path okay and then that's it

126
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,080
we just feel the rest please move

127
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,020
was and okay so this is a simple maze

128
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,259
but how do we make it like the maze we

129
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,300
put some other parts like

130
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,400
like

131
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,580
we put some other lights yeah we can

132
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,500
turn we can put another path to the end

133
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,319
or per dead end

134
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,600
good point okay so how about this way

135
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,060
it's a similar idea okay so within the

136
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,400
past but you are only asking for one

137
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,560
very pass okay let's generate a few more

138
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,500
to spare you know it could cross right

139
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,800
but for each other value pass I put

140
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,680
Awards randomly somehow to block it

141
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,840
and then that will work

142
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,340
is there a problem with this solution

143
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,160
think

144
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,139
Sly yeah it could be but it's efficient

145
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,240
and this one right because you don't

146
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,940
know this one you just say why

147
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,500
true okay I promise not to write the

148
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,840
code but this is unit okay and then

149
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,319
generate you know the maze

150
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,660
generate generate okay Maze and then if

151
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,000
maze is valid

152
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,940
then we do 10 right we can make

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,520
otherwise we keep doing this okay okay

154
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,620
so this one remember what did I talk

155
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,539
about so we generally a path right we

156
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,819
General path

157
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:23,039
and then we generate a few other parts

158
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,960
for broke it broke it when I broke it I

159
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,639
broke the meter block the same route of

160
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,319
the original value path that color

161
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,720
problem so when we broke it we don't

162
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,599
broken the Cross Point okay makes sense

163
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,720
yeah then that will work all right the

164
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,880
idea is that we generate a very fast

165
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,720
first and then we generate a few other

166
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,919
paths which will block it right

167
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,960
depending on how many Value parts you

168
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,300
want okay we could have two then we

169
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,699
generate two Valley paths

170
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,259
okay and then we generate a few other

171
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,319
parts which will eventually we're going

172
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:58,500
to block it okay and okay so how do we

173
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:00,300
generate a value path right this is the

174
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,060
whole picture and come back to this

175
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,160
question how do we generate a path

176
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,819
yeah amazed how do we generate a value

177
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,380
class we put entrance and exit yes they

178
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,819
enter in the exit on the border right

179
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,759
remember the a few days that's what we

180
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:17,880
talked about that engine here

181
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,580
right we learned a lot of generality

182
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,660
right so I could just say the entry is

183
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,120
on the top

184
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,599
all right if you want the engine to be

185
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,160
here here let's find a generate here and

186
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,580
I will take the magic

187
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,339
like says I know the trader Matrix let's

188
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,800
say the engine is on the top and the

189
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,899
exit could be somewhere on the border

190
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,779
okay why do we need the engine to the

191
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,159
top I can say okay every time I can only

192
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:47,700
walk down

193
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,519
I can only walk down walk left or work

194
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,560
right until it hits the boundary right

195
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,680
so randomly cross a coin with three

196
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:00,300
possibilities face up face down or

197
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,580
neutral huh so down left right if random

198
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,260
pick an a direction you go go okay when

199
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,580
it hits the boundary this is a very fast

200
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,920
another way we could be like that right

201
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,220
and hits this boundary that's a very

202
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,220
fast

203
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,420
okay his part he's found another task

204
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,420
like that's one way

205
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,560
this this is the entrance that's the

206
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,740
exit no no we don't Define the exit here

207
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,420
we just let it dry hit the boundary

208
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,180
which is the exit we're asked to

209
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,339
generate a path we don't care we are not

210
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,839
saying okay

211
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:42,480
after here let me become complicated

212
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,959
because you are trying to find a path

213
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,240
from A to B actually that will work but

214
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:51,000
it's complicated we want to simplify it

215
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,240
so we don't care where is the exit as

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,980
long as it's on the boundary as always

217
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,980
doesn't hit the boundary

218
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,860
you can prove it always look on the top

219
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,779
every time you'll need to work down work

220
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,839
left of work right you you don't go up

221
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,519
so every time you move and move the

222
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,140
first time it has to go down okay it

223
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,120
can't go left or right otherwise it will

224
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,100
be on the top right that doesn't make

225
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,980
like any sense right the first move has

226
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,560
to move down and after that

227
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,839
you can move left or right or down right

228
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,459
you try this many times you will

229
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,700
eventually hit the left boundary right

230
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,620
boundary of bottom button am I right but

231
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,040
what if the main just keeps on going in

232
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,399
a loop what do you mean

233
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:38,040
the loop a loop and it never ends you

234
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,440
mean here just because no it never

235
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,680
happens in this case because it never

236
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,240
goes bad all right

237
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,920
but you can keep on going right left

238
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,300
right left right yeah that's good

239
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,820
spotting yeah that's what you mean right

240
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,440
yeah good point Okay so

241
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,300
we can just use the hash

242
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,180
the hash table to remember the pictures

243
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,640
we visited am I

244
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,920
yeah okay so

245
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,660
go down go left this piece that we are

246
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,760
visiting we can't go back we can't go

247
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,200
back and then only give you two choices

248
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,800
all right

249
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,380
yeah I saw you were talking about these

250
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,500
go you know like that you never have

251
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,240
satisfied but to be fair we can add four

252
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,360
directions

253
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,019
as long as we have a headset right so if

254
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,500
we have this uh headset scene table

255
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,120
which feature we have seen we can add a

256
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,519
pointing up Direction but it depends on

257
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,700
how you like the path to look like right

258
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,740
it could be very curly right if you add

259
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,779
in the top you could be very curly in

260
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,220
the country this way right level work

261
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,079
right

262
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,180
yeah okay so to sum up what happened

263
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,920
today

264
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,740
learned about

265
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,480
how to generate a maze a general an

266
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,240
Amaze what kind of parameter we need to

267
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,620
fit the computer first the more kind of

268
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,360
the parameters how big is the maze yeah

269
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,339
how many Value parts you want it to be

270
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,920
right these are the most important

271
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:07,260
parameters and then how do we generate a

272
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,360
maze what kind of Agron ever you

273
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,860
mentioned the point the randomly General

274
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,779
Maze and then check if it's available

275
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,500
but the thing is how do you check if

276
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,500
it's a very nice

277
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:22,320
so if you got a headset and and you can

278
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:26,360
go up yeah what happens if you go like

279
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,360
if you go like this yeah

280
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:34,079
ah then then you can't go anywhere good

281
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,000
point that's a very good that's a corner

282
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,740
case right there's no parts right so

283
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,140
okay that's good as you can think of

284
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,019
that that's very very good yeah that's

285
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:45,000
one situation it could happen but maybe

286
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,279
unlikely to happen because every time

287
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,079
you pick you know this is the public

288
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,079
busy piece right that was saying before

289
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:54,660
what if you don't hit a boundary that's

290
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,899
true yeah yeah very good okay so let's

291
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,880
get rid of this app right and just uh

292
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,380
down left or right and you will have

293
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,420
about it all right

294
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,160
yeah your hair powder right that's very

295
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,320
good okay I didn't think of that very

296
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,120
good very clever okay

297
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,160
that was gonna be a good job okay and

298
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,040
you said this one how do we check if the

299
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,200
metric is amazed you give it a square

300
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,300
with the one and zero how do we how do

301
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,959
we determine if it's a maze first of all

302
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,260
if I if they are entrance or axes in the

303
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:28,160
border right entrance engine yeah and

304
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:31,200
then you try to find

305
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,360
finding the nearest exit to the engine

306
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,820
you can use the aggram

307
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,740
question

308
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,139
remember we are given this Maze We

309
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,959
equivalent is entering right and we want

310
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:45,300
to find out the nearest exit

311
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,639
to the engine in the Maze right we talk

312
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,920
about these Professor Stephenson the

313
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,800
only difference is that we are not sure

314
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,279
which entry we can just pull forth these

315
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,320
uh pictures these are places on the maze

316
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,839
to see if it's an entry and then we just

317
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,480
apply an accident so this one is

318
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,320
breakfast search or deficit generator

319
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,660
makes

320
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,240
pick or not pick right you're saying

321
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,800
each Pizza has two zero and one two

322
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,360
Choice it's just quickly random

323
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,920
generated I don't know how efficient is

324
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,660
that because the maze could be very big

325
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,519
and then you're randomly populating that

326
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,440
and then you try to listen that's a very

327
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,060
good solution very good thinking and the

328
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,459
other way is the opposite we generally

329
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,339
the very pass and then after that we

330
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:29,220
just populate the rest right

331
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,200
and that's it right okay so have you

332
