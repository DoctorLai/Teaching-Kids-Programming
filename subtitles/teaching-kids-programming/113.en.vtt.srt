1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,990

hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today
 

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,670
hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today
good good uh it's friday okay

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
good good uh it's friday okay
 

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,950
good good uh it's friday okay
okay let's do it so

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
okay let's do it so
 

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,749
okay let's do it so
today we're going to count the numbers

8
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
today we're going to count the numbers
 

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,870
today we're going to count the numbers
with unique digits so what are the

10
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
with unique digits so what are the
 

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,830
with unique digits so what are the
numbers we

12
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
numbers we
 

13
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,189
numbers we
unique digits like one two three this is

14
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:21,199
unique digits like one two three this is
 

15
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,390
unique digits like one two three this is
unique difference

16
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:22,400
unique difference
 

17
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,790
unique difference
but one two two this is not unity

18
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
but one two two this is not unity
 

19
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,830
but one two two this is not unity
because two

20
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
because two
 

21
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,870
because two
appears twice twice how about appear

22
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
appears twice twice how about appear
 

23
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,470
appears twice twice how about appear
three times it's

24
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
three times it's
 

25
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,950
three times it's
any any if it appears more than one

26
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
any any if it appears more than one
 

27
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,510
any any if it appears more than one
times

28
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
times
 

29
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,350
times
it's not unit digit okay so given a

30
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
it's not unit digit okay so given a
 

31
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,310
it's not unit digit okay so given a
number

32
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
number
 

33
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,549
number
and we want to count how many

34
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
and we want to count how many
 

35
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,190
and we want to count how many
numbers with unique digit between the

36
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
numbers with unique digit between the
 

37
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,790
numbers with unique digit between the
range

38
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
range
 

39
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,670
range
okay suppose this is x between the range

40
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
okay suppose this is x between the range
 

41
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,029
okay suppose this is x between the range
bigger than zero

42
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
bigger than zero
 

43
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,229
bigger than zero
smaller than 10 to the power n

44
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
smaller than 10 to the power n
 

45
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,869
smaller than 10 to the power n
i'll get 10 to the power n 10 to the

46
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
i'll get 10 to the power n 10 to the
 

47
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,550
i'll get 10 to the power n 10 to the
power

48
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:02,560

 

49
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:11,350

[Music]

50
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360

 

51
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,990

100 yeah 2 to the power 0

52
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000

 

53
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,749

1 yes so any number except 0 to the

54
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
1 yes so any number except 0 to the
 

55
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,950
1 yes so any number except 0 to the
power of

56
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960

 

57
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,270

uh 0. question ideally it's one but

58
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
uh 0. question ideally it's one but
 

59
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,590
uh 0. question ideally it's one but
maybe mathematically it's not defined so

60
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
maybe mathematically it's not defined so
 

61
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,390
maybe mathematically it's not defined so
any number except zero to the power of

62
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
any number except zero to the power of
 

63
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,710
any number except zero to the power of
zero is one okay

64
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
zero is one okay
 

65
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,830
zero is one okay
okay so to use the remember the binary

66
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
okay so to use the remember the binary
 

67
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,870
okay so to use the remember the binary
yeah finally

68
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
yeah finally
 

69
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,950
yeah finally
why is that look so finally one zero one

70
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
why is that look so finally one zero one
 

71
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,109
why is that look so finally one zero one
zero okay so this means one right

72
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
zero okay so this means one right
 

73
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,749
zero okay so this means one right
yeah yeah yeah it's two to the power of

74
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
yeah yeah yeah it's two to the power of
 

75
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,389
yeah yeah yeah it's two to the power of
zero

76
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
zero
 

77
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,389
zero
like 123 twenty-three

78
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
like 123 twenty-three
 

79
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,109
like 123 twenty-three
this is one what ones we call it once

80
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
this is one what ones we call it once
 

81
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:57,749
this is one what ones we call it once
yeah

82
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
yeah
 

83
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,670
yeah
this is tens right this is a hundreds

84
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
this is tens right this is a hundreds
 

85
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,109
this is tens right this is a hundreds
all right yes right so that's

86
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
all right yes right so that's
 

87
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,309
all right yes right so that's
a hundred plus twenty plus three

88
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
a hundred plus twenty plus three
 

89
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,350
a hundred plus twenty plus three
correct so that that's why

90
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
correct so that that's why
 

91
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,869
correct so that that's why
10 to the power of 0 is 1

92
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
10 to the power of 0 is 1
 

93
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,309
10 to the power of 0 is 1
10 to the power of 0 yeah got it

94
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
10 to the power of 0 yeah got it
 

95
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,350
10 to the power of 0 yeah got it
so look so we're given this

96
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
so look so we're given this
 

97
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,750
so look so we're given this
and we want to count how many how many

98
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
and we want to count how many how many
 

99
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,630
and we want to count how many how many
numbers

100
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
numbers
 

101
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,910
numbers
are unique with unique digits it doesn't

102
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
are unique with unique digits it doesn't
 

103
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,910
are unique with unique digits it doesn't
have any duplicate digit between this

104
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
have any duplicate digit between this
 

105
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,790
have any duplicate digit between this
range

106
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
range
 

107
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,070
range
for example when n is zero how many

108
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
for example when n is zero how many
 

109
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,790
for example when n is zero how many
when n is zero so

110
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
when n is zero so
 

111
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,070
when n is zero so
smaller smaller than one so how many

112
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
smaller smaller than one so how many
 

113
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,030
smaller smaller than one so how many
how many numbers within this range is

114
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
how many numbers within this range is
 

115
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,750
how many numbers within this range is
unique

116
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760

 

117
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,630

isn't it

118
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640

 

119
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,869

yeah it doesn't have duplicate numbers

120
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
yeah it doesn't have duplicate numbers
 

121
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,949
yeah it doesn't have duplicate numbers
so how many numbers

122
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
so how many numbers
 

123
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,149
so how many numbers
how many numbers would this range look

124
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
how many numbers would this range look
 

125
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,309
how many numbers would this range look
but no smaller than one bigger or equal

126
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
but no smaller than one bigger or equal
 

127
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,229
but no smaller than one bigger or equal
than zero so it must be

128
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
than zero so it must be
 

129
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,990
than zero so it must be
the only possibility is zero right yeah

130
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
the only possibility is zero right yeah
 

131
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,589
the only possibility is zero right yeah
so it's one the answer is one because

132
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
so it's one the answer is one because
 

133
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,830
so it's one the answer is one because
there's only one number which is unique

134
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
there's only one number which is unique
 

135
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,070
there's only one number which is unique
zero it doesn't have any difficult

136
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
zero it doesn't have any difficult
 

137
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,070
zero it doesn't have any difficult
numbers right one one

138
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
numbers right one one
 

139
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,630
numbers right one one
is less than one no one is not less than

140
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
is less than one no one is not less than
 

141
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,589
is less than one no one is not less than
one yeah

142
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
one yeah
 

143
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,830
one yeah
okay how about n is one so that would be

144
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
okay how about n is one so that would be
 

145
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,869
okay how about n is one so that would be
what x bigger than zero smaller than

146
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
what x bigger than zero smaller than
 

147
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,350
what x bigger than zero smaller than
ten so how many numbers which this range

148
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
ten so how many numbers which this range
 

149
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,949
ten so how many numbers which this range
has unique

150
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
has unique
 

151
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,309
has unique
10 yes yeah this is 0 to 9

152
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
10 yes yeah this is 0 to 9
 

153
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,190
10 yes yeah this is 0 to 9
right that's 10 numbers yeah okay so we

154
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
right that's 10 numbers yeah okay so we
 

155
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,990
right that's 10 numbers yeah okay so we
got it yeah

156
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
got it yeah
 

157
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,750
got it yeah
and then how about two we want to count

158
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
and then how about two we want to count
 

159
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,430
and then how about two we want to count
bigger than zero x smaller than 100.

160
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
bigger than zero x smaller than 100.
 

161
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,550
bigger than zero x smaller than 100.
so any idea how we're counting this if

162
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
so any idea how we're counting this if
 

163
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,390
so any idea how we're counting this if
you're not sure we can always

164
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
you're not sure we can always
 

165
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,750
you're not sure we can always
11 22. no no no no

166
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
11 22. no no no no

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,189
90 00 99 how many numbers come on
there are 100 numbers 100 numbers yes

176
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
there are 100 numbers 100 numbers yes
 

177
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,789
there are 100 numbers 100 numbers yes
100 numbers

178
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
100 numbers
 

179
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,710
100 numbers
but we are excluding we need to

180
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
but we are excluding we need to
 

181
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,150
but we are excluding we need to
excluding one one

182
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
excluding one one
 

183
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,270
excluding one one
two two three three four four how many

184
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
two two three three four four how many
 

185
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,230
two two three three four four how many
of them

186
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
of them
 

187
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,510
of them
nine okay so 100 minus 9

188
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
nine okay so 100 minus 9
 

189
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,710
nine okay so 100 minus 9
91 yes okay so if n

190
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
91 yes okay so if n
 

191
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,030
91 yes okay so if n
is two we need to return 91 okay yes

192
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
is two we need to return 91 okay yes
 

193
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,070
is two we need to return 91 okay yes
so how if there are n numbers if any

194
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
so how if there are n numbers if any
 

195
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,070
so how if there are n numbers if any
speaker length

196
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
speaker length
 

197
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,510
speaker length
10 for example what's the answer

198
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520

 

199
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,629

of course if n is bigger than 10

200
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
of course if n is bigger than 10
 

201
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,350
of course if n is bigger than 10
so the answer will be f10 right because

202
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
so the answer will be f10 right because
 

203
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,790
so the answer will be f10 right because
look

204
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
look
 

205
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,390
look
because if it's the

206
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
because if it's the
 

207
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,390
because if it's the
uh if it's if you can't find

208
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
uh if it's if you can't find
 

209
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,590
uh if it's if you can't find
any n digit

210
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
any n digit
 

211
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,870
any n digit
number with unique digits when n

212
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
number with unique digits when n
 

213
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,510
number with unique digits when n
is bigger than 10 right why is that

214
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
is bigger than 10 right why is that
 

215
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:11,909
is bigger than 10 right why is that
because

216
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
because
 

217
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,189
because
look if n is 11 you can't find any 11

218
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
look if n is 11 you can't find any 11
 

219
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,550
look if n is 11 you can't find any 11
digits with unique with unique

220
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
digits with unique with unique
 

221
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,550
digits with unique with unique
digits i'm right yeah because you only

222
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
digits i'm right yeah because you only
 

223
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,189
digits i'm right yeah because you only
how many digits have you got

224
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
how many digits have you got
 

225
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,390
how many digits have you got
oh no how many all together did you

oh no how many all together did you
 

227
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,310
oh no how many all together did you
you have you got zero to nine how many

228
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,350
okay oh for example like you have you
have 10 balls

284
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
have 10 balls
 

285
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,510
have 10 balls
balls both and you have 11 box

286
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
balls both and you have 11 box
 

287
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,629
balls both and you have 11 box
okay and you want to you want to put the

okay and you want to you want to put the
put the 10 balls into the 11 box

290
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
put the 10 balls into the 11 box
 

291
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,430
put the 10 balls into the 11 box
and we can get and at least at least

292
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
and we can get and at least at least
 

293
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,469
and we can get and at least at least
okay we're talking about at least

294
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
okay we're talking about at least
 

295
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,309
okay we're talking about at least
at least one box is empty can i get that

296
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
at least one box is empty can i get that
 

297
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,629
at least one box is empty can i get that
yeah yeah yeah that's obvious yeah

298
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
yeah yeah yeah that's obvious yeah
 

299
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,230
yeah yeah yeah that's obvious yeah
because you only have 10 balls and

300
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
because you only have 10 balls and
 

301
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,150
because you only have 10 balls and
how can you put it in 11 20

302
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
how can you put it in 11 20
 

303
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,909
how can you put it in 11 20
11 boxes right you can put all of them

304
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:15,919
11 boxes right you can put all of them
 

305
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,710
11 boxes right you can put all of them
into one but

306
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
into one but
 

307
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,469
into one but
or you can the best you can do is put 10

308
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
or you can the best you can do is put 10
 

309
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,189
or you can the best you can do is put 10
10 balls in 10 boxes and then now you

310
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
10 balls in 10 boxes and then now you
 

311
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,909
10 balls in 10 boxes and then now you
have one more box one box which is empty

312
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
have one more box one box which is empty
 

313
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,110
have one more box one box which is empty
am right all right so that coming back

314
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
am right all right so that coming back
 

315
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,550
am right all right so that coming back
to this question

to this question
 

317
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,550
to this question
if you have a 10 digit and you want to

318
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
if you have a 10 digit and you want to

put it in the 11
 

321
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,430
put it in the 11
digits you can't find this without

322
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
digits you can't find this without
 

323
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,870
digits you can't find this without
duplicate right

324
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
duplicate right
 

325
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,350
duplicate right
i'm right if you put you have 11 digits

326
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
i'm right if you put you have 11 digits
 

327
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,270
i'm right if you put you have 11 digits
it must be non-unique am right

328
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
it must be non-unique am right
 

329
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,670
it must be non-unique am right
am i right yeah does it make sense yes

330
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
am i right yeah does it make sense yes
 

331
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,350
am i right yeah does it make sense yes
okay

good question because the first thing
 

371
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,790
good question because the first thing
you can't have zero

372
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
you can't have zero
 

373
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,350
you can't have zero
you can only put one to nine right yeah

374
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
you can only put one to nine right yeah
 

375
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,070
you can only put one to nine right yeah
the second number how many possibilities

376
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
the second number how many possibilities
 

377
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,509
the second number how many possibilities
one two nine one to nine nine

378
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
one two nine one to nine nine
 

379
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,949
one two nine one to nine nine
yeah yeah no ten

380
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
yeah yeah no ten
 

381
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,310
yeah yeah no ten
four thousand one more quest uh

382
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
four thousand one more quest uh
 

383
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,990
four thousand one more quest uh
yes is it ten or nine

384
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
yes is it ten or nine
 

385
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,030
yes is it ten or nine
that's one second digit because we have

386
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
that's one second digit because we have
 

387
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,470
that's one second digit because we have
already used one digit

388
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
already used one digit
 

389
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,430
already used one digit
yeah for the first case but we have one

390
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
yeah for the first case but we have one
 

391
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,949
yeah for the first case but we have one
more

392
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
more
 

393
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,590
more
nine yeah nine why is mine can you tell

394
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
nine yeah nine why is mine can you tell
 

395
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,630
nine yeah nine why is mine can you tell
me because

396
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
me because
 

397
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,350
me because
you actually can do ten but you already

398
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
you actually can do ten but you already
 

399
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,230
you actually can do ten but you already
use one

400
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
use one
 

401
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,670
use one
for the first one so you subtract one so

402
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
for the first one so you subtract one so
 

403
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,310
for the first one so you subtract one so
that's nine

404
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
that's nine
 

405
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,470
that's nine
yes yes because because for the second

406
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
yes yes because because for the second
 

407
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,509
yes yes because because for the second
number i can use

408
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
number i can use
 

409
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,630
number i can use
zero right i can use zero

410
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
zero right i can use zero
 

411
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,949
zero right i can use zero
and then i use one at the beginning and

412
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
and then i use one at the beginning and
 

413
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,430
and then i use one at the beginning and
i plus more plus zero so that's zero and

414
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
i plus more plus zero so that's zero and
 

415
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,430
i plus more plus zero so that's zero and
that's nine and that's my possibility

416
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
that's nine and that's my possibility
 

417
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,710
that's nine and that's my possibility
including zero

418
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
including zero
 

419
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,150
including zero
okay so first for third one

420
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
okay so first for third one
 

421
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,430
okay so first for third one
how many possibilities eight

422
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
how many possibilities eight
 

423
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,990
how many possibilities eight
yes because we use two and now we have a

424
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
yes because we use two and now we have a
 

425
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,949
yes because we use two and now we have a
yeah

426
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
yeah
 

427
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,949
yeah
eight so how many possibilities if i add

428
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
eight so how many possibilities if i add
 

429
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,230
eight so how many possibilities if i add
one more zero here

430
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240

 

431
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,509

seven we are done okay so you get if we

432
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
seven we are done okay so you get if we
 

433
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,389
seven we are done okay so you get if we
have a function

434
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
have a function
 

435
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,590
have a function
f f n f k

436
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
f f n f k
 

437
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,750
f f n f k
meaning k digit number with unique

438
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
meaning k digit number with unique
 

439
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,470
meaning k digit number with unique
num unit digits yes then we can

440
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
num unit digits yes then we can
 

441
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,470
num unit digits yes then we can
calculate this way right

442
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
calculate this way right
 

443
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,750
calculate this way right
okay so let's do it

444
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760

 

445
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,790

let's do it define count okay called n

446
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
let's do it define count okay called n
 

447
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,949
let's do it define count okay called n
remember count and what's missing here

448
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
remember count and what's missing here
 

449
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,230
remember count and what's missing here
column if n equals

450
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
column if n equals
 

451
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,350
column if n equals
zero return what

452
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
zero return what
 

453
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,300
zero return what
do you tell me how many remember this is

454
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,310
do you tell me how many remember this is
 

455
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,430
do you tell me how many remember this is
[Music]

456
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
[Music]
 

457
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,630
[Music]
remember okay so now we define

458
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
remember okay so now we define
 

459
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,710
remember okay so now we define
f f remember is the n size f k

460
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
f f remember is the n size f k
 

461
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,150
f f remember is the n size f k
we can define another function here

462
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
we can define another function here
 

463
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,069
we can define another function here
what's missing column

464
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
what's missing column
 

465
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,829
what's missing column
okay is the is the k digit

466
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
okay is the is the k digit
 

467
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,590

number which has which is unique which
 

471
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,870
number which has which is unique which
only has unique digits right

472
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
only has unique digits right
 

473
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:56,710
only has unique digits right
okay

474
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720

 

475
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,030

only one digit how many can we get

476
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
only one digit how many can we get
 

477
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,470
only one digit how many can we get
how many digits for one

478
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480

 

479
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,990

one digit i mean one digit

480
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000

 

481
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,430

how many one digit should we return 10

482
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
how many one digit should we return 10
 

483
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,030
how many one digit should we return 10
instead zero to nine right ten

484
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
instead zero to nine right ten
 

485
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,470
instead zero to nine right ten
okay on then we look then we can do this

486
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
okay on then we look then we can do this

wrench one okay something
 

495
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,750
wrench one okay something
okay um

496
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760

 

497
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,710

look look at is what nine times nine we

498
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
look look at is what nine times nine we
 

499
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,389
look look at is what nine times nine we
want to calculate this nine times nine

500
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
want to calculate this nine times nine
 

501
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:38,790
want to calculate this nine times nine
times

502
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
times
 

503
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,550
times
eight times seven right and times here

504
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:41,560
eight times seven right and times here
 

505
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,350
eight times seven right and times here
648.

506
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
648.
 

507
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,750
648.
no look okay maybe k plus one i'll come

508
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
no look okay maybe k plus one i'll come
 

509
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,790
no look okay maybe k plus one i'll come
back to that okay so answer

510
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
back to that okay so answer
 

511
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,030
back to that okay so answer
equal answer equals answer times

512
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
equal answer equals answer times
 

513
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,550
equal answer equals answer times
look at the ten uh

514
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
look at the ten uh
 

515
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,990
look at the ten uh
the should be 10

516
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
the should be 10
 

517
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,829
the should be 10
minus i right let's do i should be 1

518
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
minus i right let's do i should be 1
 

519
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,430
minus i right let's do i should be 1
uh 1 k

520
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
uh 1 k
 

521
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,430
uh 1 k
when i when i

522
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
when i when i
 

523
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,550
when i when i
uh when i

524
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
uh when i
 

525
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,990
uh when i
is 1 then you times 9 when i is 2

526
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
is 1 then you times 9 when i is 2
 

527
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,870
is 1 then you times 9 when i is 2
actually let's put it 9 here so because

528
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
actually let's put it 9 here so because
 

529
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,550
actually let's put it 9 here so because
the first number we want the time is cap

530
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
the first number we want the time is cap
 

531
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,590
the first number we want the time is cap
9

532
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
9
 

533
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,949
9
and then when k is 2

534
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
and then when k is 2
 

535
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,550
and then when k is 2
we want to times times the times

536
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:30,560
we want to times times the times
 

537
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,150
we want to times times the times
i right and then return answer

538
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160

 

539
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,910

okay does it make sense does it make

540
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
okay does it make sense does it make
 

541
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,190
okay does it make sense does it make
sense uh

542
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
sense uh
 

543
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,550
sense uh
can you get it because we want to

544
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
can you get it because we want to
 

545
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,750
can you get it because we want to
calculate uh we want to calculate

546
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
calculate uh we want to calculate
 

547
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,670
calculate uh we want to calculate
um we want to calculate

548
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
um we want to calculate
 

549
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,829
um we want to calculate
the f is the number of digits uh number

550
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
the f is the number of digits uh number
 

551
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,750
the f is the number of digits uh number
uh fk is the number of

552
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
uh fk is the number of
 

553
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,269
uh fk is the number of
k digit numbers with unique digits

554
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
k digit numbers with unique digits
 

555
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,710
k digit numbers with unique digits
okay with unique digits so

556
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
okay with unique digits so
 

557
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,230
okay with unique digits so
this function will return the number of

558
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
this function will return the number of
 

559
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,870
this function will return the number of
number of num numbers with unique digits

560
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
number of num numbers with unique digits
 

561
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,550
number of num numbers with unique digits
for k digit

562
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
for k digit
 

563
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,430
for k digit
numbers okay it's a bit tricky yeah

564
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
numbers okay it's a bit tricky yeah
 

565
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,790
numbers okay it's a bit tricky yeah
really

566
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
really
 

567
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,230
really
uh

568
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240

 

569
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,990

yes i think that i i think

570
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
yes i think that i i think
 

571
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,629
yes i think that i i think
i think we probably don't need don't uh

572
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,639
i think we probably don't need don't uh
 

573
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,750
i think we probably don't need don't uh
don't mean this

574
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
don't mean this
 

575
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,430
don't mean this
because k equals one k equals one is to

576
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
because k equals one k equals one is to
 

577
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,150
because k equals one k equals one is to
return

578
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
return
 

579
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,910
return
nine because only uh this may not work

580
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
nine because only uh this may not work
 

581
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,949
nine because only uh this may not work
so we don't

582
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
so we don't
 

583
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,910
so we don't
do this okay and now we need to sum this

584
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
do this okay and now we need to sum this
 

585
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,230
do this okay and now we need to sum this
up

586
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
up
 

587
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,829
up
look some return

588
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
look some return
 

589
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,949
look some return
sum f

590
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
sum f
 

591
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,829
sum f
k for k in

592
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839
k for k in
 

593
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,949
k for k in
range

594
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959

 

595
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,030

and plus one right

596
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
and plus one right
 

597
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,430
and plus one right
can you say that the answer is what

598
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
can you say that the answer is what
 

599
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:09,189
can you say that the answer is what
the answer is what

600
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199

 

601
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,990

so look we can do this answer equals

602
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
so look we can do this answer equals
 

603
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,550
so look we can do this answer equals
zero

604
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
zero
 

605
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,670
zero
and then for i in

606
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
and then for i in
 

607
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,910
and then for i in
range 2 n plus 1

608
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
range 2 n plus 1
 

609
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,389
range 2 n plus 1
answer plus equals fk

610
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
answer plus equals fk
 

611
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,990
answer plus equals fk
and we can we can work within what

612
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
and we can we can work within what
 

613
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,470
and we can we can work within what
answer another answer yeah because here

614
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
answer another answer yeah because here
 

615
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,550
answer another answer yeah because here
we there's a special case is when

616
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
we there's a special case is when
 

617
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,829
we there's a special case is when
n is one and is zero return one when n

618
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
n is one and is zero return one when n
 

619
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,949
n is one and is zero return one when n
is one you should return ten ten

620
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
is one you should return ten ten
 

621
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,189
is one you should return ten ten
right because when n is one it should

622
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
right because when n is one it should
 

623
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,310
right because when n is one it should
return 10 and when

624
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
return 10 and when
 

625
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,310
return 10 and when
n is 2 look away when n is 2

626
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
n is 2 look away when n is 2
 

627
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,230
n is 2 look away when n is 2
return will be 10 plus fk

628
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240
return will be 10 plus fk
 

629
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,389
return will be 10 plus fk
which is f 2 right f2 which is what

630
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
which is f 2 right f2 which is what

this function nine times nine times

660
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
this function nine times nine times
 

661
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,629
this function nine times nine times
eight yeah this

662
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
eight yeah this
 

663
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,910
eight yeah this
these fk is this function okay and then

664
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
these fk is this function okay and then
 

665
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,069
these fk is this function okay and then
now we need to count how many of them so

666
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
now we need to count how many of them so
 

667
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:44,710
now we need to count how many of them so
it's 10

668
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
it's 10
 

669
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,269
it's 10
plus plus f2 plus f3 plus s4 okay so

670
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
plus plus f2 plus f3 plus s4 okay so
 

671
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,470
plus plus f2 plus f3 plus s4 okay so
that's the total number of uh numbers

672
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
that's the total number of uh numbers
 

673
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,350
that's the total number of uh numbers
with unique digits okay

674
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
with unique digits okay
 

675
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,990
with unique digits okay
yeah this is mathematics to calculate it

676
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
yeah this is mathematics to calculate it
 

677
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,949
yeah this is mathematics to calculate it
right

678
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
right
 

679
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,910
right
all right yeah so how we counting we

680
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
all right yeah so how we counting we
 

681
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,710
all right yeah so how we counting we
count

682
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
count
 

683
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,230
count
the one digit and we added

684
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
the one digit and we added
 

685
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,870
the one digit and we added
two digits and we added three digits

686
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
two digits and we added three digits
 

687
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,069
two digits and we added three digits
three

688
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
three
 

689
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,670
three
so the overall discount is what f

690
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
so the overall discount is what f
 

691
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,790
so the overall discount is what f
f1 f0 plus f1

692
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
f1 f0 plus f1
 

693
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,150
f1 f0 plus f1
plus f2 plus plus fn

694
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
plus f2 plus plus fn
 

695
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,389
plus f2 plus plus fn
okay

696
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399

 

697
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,069

okay so this is what 81 plus 10

698
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
okay so this is what 81 plus 10
 

699
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,110
okay so this is what 81 plus 10
is 91 yeah it's the same as we a hundred

700
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
is 91 yeah it's the same as we a hundred
 

701
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,030
is 91 yeah it's the same as we a hundred
substrate nine right it's the same

702
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
substrate nine right it's the same
 

703
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,629
substrate nine right it's the same
okay so now we can do this look at this

704
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
okay so now we can do this look at this
 

705
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:40,870
okay so now we can do this look at this
f

706
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
f
 

707
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,629
f
function we can do it using the dynamic

708
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
function we can do it using the dynamic
 

709
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,030
function we can do it using the dynamic
programming okay

710
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
programming okay
 

711
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,189
programming okay
yeah a dynamic programming so look how

712
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
yeah a dynamic programming so look how
 

713
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:57,829
yeah a dynamic programming so look how
many dynamic programming do we have

714
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839

 

715
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,269

yeah okay so look this ff

716
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
yeah okay so look this ff
 

717
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,870
yeah okay so look this ff
function is a function so look can we

718
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
function is a function so look can we
 

719
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,429
function is a function so look can we
write this

720
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
write this
 

721
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,549
write this
f k equals

722
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
f k equals
 

723
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,350
f k equals
f k minus 1 times times y

724
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
f k minus 1 times times y
 

725
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,510
f k minus 1 times times y
so look we don't know times one okay

726
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
so look we don't know times one okay
 

727
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,829
so look we don't know times one okay
look

728
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839
look
 

729
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,990
look

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,710
eleven minus k come on why what take you
so long

828
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:52,720
so long
 

829
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,470
so long
huh huh okay

transition function right yeah
 

837
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,470
transition function right yeah
all right so we can implement it using

838
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
all right so we can implement it using
 

839
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,909
all right so we can implement it using

zero yes so do you understand why we can
 

941
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,669
zero yes so do you understand why we can
make it a one

942
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
make it a one
 

943

in french ten
 

1001
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,430
in french ten
range range let's do it k plus one okay

1002
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:19,440
range range let's do it k plus one okay
 

1003
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,789
range range let's do it k plus one okay
so look if if k bigger than 10 will

1004
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
so look if if k bigger than 10 will
 

1005
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,590
so look if if k bigger than 10 will
return

1006
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
return
 

1007
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,549
return
we return one return zero okay just make

1008
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:26,559
we return one return zero okay just make
 

1009
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,350
we return one return zero okay just make
sure

1010

sure
 

1011
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,269
sure
and then now we can do this one is

1012
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,279
and then now we can do this one is
 

1013
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,710
and then now we can do this one is
smaller than plus one

1014
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
smaller than plus one
 

1015
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,710
smaller than plus one
uh actually here you need to start with

1016
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,720
uh actually here you need to start with
 

1017
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,390
uh actually here you need to start with
two okay because ftp

1054
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:57,679
db4
 

1055
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,870
db4
and here dbk right remember the previous

1056
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:00,880
and here dbk right remember the previous
 

1057
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,870
and here dbk right remember the previous
one top down

1058
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:02,880
one top down
 

1059
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,510
one top down
if k equals zero returns zero if k

1060
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
if k equals zero returns zero if k
 

1061
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,029
if k equals zero returns zero if k
equals one return knife

1062
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:07,039
equals one return knife
 

1063
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,029
equals one return knife
otherwise return what f k minus 1

1064
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
otherwise return what f k minus 1
 

1065
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,870
otherwise return what f k minus 1
times 11 minus k right so you are

1066
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
times 11 minus k right so you are
 

1067
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,190
times 11 minus k right so you are
calculating from the top to the bottom

1068
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,200
calculating from the top to the bottom
 

1069
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,950
calculating from the top to the bottom
this one is calculating from bottom to

1070
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
this one is calculating from bottom to
 

1071
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,750
this one is calculating from bottom to
the top

1072
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:19,760
the top
 

1073
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,230
the top
right this one doesn't have a recursion

1074
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,240
right this one doesn't have a recursion
 

1075
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,190
right this one doesn't have a recursion
right

1076
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200
right
 

1077
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,390
right
it doesn't have a request but the

1078
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
it doesn't have a request but the
 

1079
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,710
it doesn't have a request but the
previous one is recursion

1080
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
previous one is recursion
 

1081
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,029
previous one is recursion
in order to make a discussion a dynamic

1082
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:29,039
in order to make a discussion a dynamic
 

1083
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,310
in order to make a discussion a dynamic
programming we need to add

1084
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:30,320
programming we need to add
 

1085
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,350
programming we need to add
what cache

1086
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,360
what cache
 

1087
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,909
what cache
we're done the notebook memorization

1088
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:35,919
we're done the notebook memorization
 

1089
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:36,630
we're done the notebook memorization
okay

1090
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
okay
 

1091
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,750
okay
so means f k then we can do this we can

1092
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:39,760
so means f k then we can do this we can
 

1093
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,230
so means f k then we can do this we can
just

1094
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,240
just
 

1095
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,350
just
do this sum return

1096
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,360
do this sum return
 

1097
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,269
do this sum return
return one sum f n

1098
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:47,279
return one sum f n
 

1099
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,789
return one sum f n
f k for k

1100
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:50,799
f k for k
 

1101
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,390
f k for k
in range

1102
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400

 

1103
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,590

range n plus one okay that's it

1104
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
range n plus one okay that's it
 

1105
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,630
range n plus one okay that's it
because we the final number is the

1106
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640
because we the final number is the
 

1107
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,470
because we the final number is the
number of the

1108
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,480
number of the
 

1109
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,669
number of the
if the number of one digit the number of

1110
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:05,679
if the number of one digit the number of
 

1111
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,590
if the number of one digit the number of
any number of two digits the three

1112
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
any number of two digits the three
 

1113
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,350
any number of two digits the three
digits four digits until k digits

1114
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
digits four digits until k digits
 

1115
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,909
digits four digits until k digits
right you add all these numbers together

1116
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
right you add all these numbers together
 

1117
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,669
right you add all these numbers together
right yeah

1118
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
right yeah
 

1119
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,590
right yeah
then you that's your final solution the

1120
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
then you that's your final solution the
 

1121
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,430
then you that's your final solution the
number of terms okay

1122
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
number of terms okay
 

1123
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,389
number of terms okay
uh so what's the so what do you learn

1124
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:20,399
uh so what's the so what do you learn
 

1125
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:20,950
uh so what's the so what do you learn
today

1126
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
today
 

1127
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,350
today
just think tell me what have you learned

1128
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,360
just think tell me what have you learned
 

1129
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,470
just think tell me what have you learned
today

1130
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
today
 

1131
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,549
today
so we learned

1132
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559

 

1133
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,830

we learned and you need no wait unique

1134
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:32,840
we learned and you need no wait unique
 

1135
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,549
we learned and you need no wait unique
number so tell me

1136
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:34,559
number so tell me
 

1137
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,070
number so tell me
in one sentence what have you learned

1138
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,080
in one sentence what have you learned
 

1139
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,310
in one sentence what have you learned
today what's the problem

1140
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320
today what's the problem
 

1141
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,070
today what's the problem
how do we approach to solving so we just

1142
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,080
how do we approach to solving so we just
 

1143
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,430
how do we approach to solving so we just
use for example if the

1144
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,440
use for example if the
 

1145
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:55,090
use for example if the
11 booth

1146
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:55,100

 

1147
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,350

[Music]

1148
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,360
[Music]
 

1149
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,510
[Music]
okay so that's that's one kind of pigeon

1150
00:27:59,510 --> 00:27:59,520
okay so that's that's one kind of pigeon
 

1151
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,350
okay so that's that's one kind of pigeon
hole okay so for example the other one

1152
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
hole okay so for example the other one
 

1153
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,990
hole okay so for example the other one
okay

1154
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
okay
 

1155
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,710
okay
you have three balls three bars and you

1156
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,720
you have three balls three bars and you
 

1157
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,590
you have three balls three bars and you
have only two boxes

1158
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:07,600
have only two boxes
 

1159
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,990
have only two boxes
yeah so i can say at least

1160
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,000
yeah so i can say at least
 

1161
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,190
yeah so i can say at least
one one at least one of the box

1162
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:15,200
one one at least one of the box
 

1163
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,310
one one at least one of the box
contains more than one balls

1164
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:18,320
contains more than one balls
 

1165
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,149
contains more than one balls
does it make sense you have three balls

1166
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:22,159
does it make sense you have three balls
 

1167
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,269
does it make sense you have three balls
and you want to put it in two boxes

1168
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:25,279
and you want to put it in two boxes
 

1169
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,470
and you want to put it in two boxes
so what happened so at least

1170
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:28,480
so what happened so at least
 

1171
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,230
so what happened so at least
one of the box contains more than one

1172
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,240
one of the box contains more than one
 

1173
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,350
one of the box contains more than one
boss got it yeah and

1174
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:35,360
boss got it yeah and
 

1175
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,630
boss got it yeah and
the previous one is you have

1176
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:38,640
the previous one is you have
 

1177
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,190
the previous one is you have
you have two balls all right you have

1178
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
you have two balls all right you have
 

1179
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,269
you have two balls all right you have
two balls you want to put it into

1180
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:43,279
two balls you want to put it into
 

1181
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,950
two balls you want to put it into
three boxes then you can say what

1182
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:46,960
three boxes then you can say what
 

1183
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,190
three boxes then you can say what
at least one box is

1184
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,200
at least one box is
 

1185
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,310
at least one box is
empty yeah so okay do you get it

1186
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,320
empty yeah so okay do you get it
 

1187
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,149
empty yeah so okay do you get it
yeah so why this is useful because look

1188
00:28:58,149 --> 00:28:58,159
yeah so why this is useful because look
 

1189
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,669
yeah so why this is useful because look
okay unique look

1190

if a number is eleven digits

1204
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
if a number is eleven digits
 

1205
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,830
if a number is eleven digits
does it have a duplicate numbers

1206
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:25,840
does it have a duplicate numbers
 

1207
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,149
does it have a duplicate numbers
is it like unique not easy the numbers

1208
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:28,159
is it like unique not easy the numbers
 

1209
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:35,909
is it like unique not easy the numbers
that contains only unique digits

1210
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:35,919

 

1211
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,110

it's not unique right because the the

1212
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120
it's not unique right because the the
 

1213
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,950
it's not unique right because the the
best case is you can do this

1214
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
best case is you can do this
 

1215
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,990
best case is you can do this
nine eight seven six five

1216
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,000
nine eight seven six five
 

1217
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,310
nine eight seven six five

1218
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,320
four three two one zero how many how
 

1219
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,310
four three two one zero how many how
many this is the number yeah

1220
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,320
many this is the number yeah
 

1221
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,510
many this is the number yeah
yes that's ten digits yeah

yes that's ten digits yeah
 

1223
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,350
yes that's ten digits yeah
so if you want one more digit what

1224
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360
so if you want one more digit what
 

1225
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,350
so if you want one more digit what
happened you're running out of digits

1226
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360
happened you're running out of digits
 

1227
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,389

order to calculate dpi

1304
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:32,960
order to calculate dpi
 

1305
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,630
order to calculate dpi
i need to calculate dpi minus 1

1306
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640
i need to calculate dpi minus 1
 

1307
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,909
i need to calculate dpi minus 1
and this is the relation between dpi

1308
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
and this is the relation between dpi
 

1309
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,549
and this is the relation between dpi
and dpi minus 1. so you can calculate

1310
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:42,559
and dpi minus 1. so you can calculate
 

1311
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,430
and dpi minus 1. so you can calculate
dpi

1312
