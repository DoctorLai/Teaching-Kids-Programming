design an agreement to check if there
 

9
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,310
design an agreement to check if there
are three consecutive

10
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
are three consecutive
 

11
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,950
are three consecutive
odds number or numbers in an array okay

12
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
odds number or numbers in an array okay
 

13
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,230

oh return
then fast yeah or you change this to one

then fast yeah or you change this to one
 

33
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,310
then fast yeah or you change this to one
and return to it

and return to it
 

35
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,440
and return to it
and air is returned two yeah all right

36
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:07,450

oh you can see we don't need it because
when it's written it's returned

when it's written it's returned
 

43
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,510
when it's written it's returned
yeah you can put the errors return so

44
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
yeah you can put the errors return so
 

45
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,469
yeah you can put the errors return so
it's all

it's all
 

47
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,910
it's all
alternatively all right all right yeah

00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
alternatively all right all right yeah
 

49
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,310
alternatively all right all right yeah
you can change this to one line yeah

50
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
you can change this to one line yeah
 

51
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,030
you can change this to one line yeah
what's this

52
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
what's this
 

53
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:39,749
what's this
return

55
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,670

or you can just do this return n

56
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
or you can just do this return n
 

57
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,950
or you can just do this return n
and one right it will be simpler yeah

58
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
and one right it will be simpler yeah
 

59
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,550
and one right it will be simpler yeah
remember that what end

60

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,910
binary the last bit
the rightmost bit is what one yeah if

66
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
the rightmost bit is what one yeah if
 

67
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,630
the rightmost bit is what one yeah if
it's zero

68
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
it's zero
 

69
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,350
it's zero
it's all even number yeah look this is

00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
it's all even number yeah look this is
 

71
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,190
it's all even number yeah look this is
simple oh you can do this

72
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
simple oh you can do this
 

73
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,350
simple oh you can do this
using the lambda function yeah change

74
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
using the lambda function yeah change
 

75
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,350
using the lambda function yeah change
this to here

76
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
this to here

85
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,630

these two lines can return can be made

86
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
these two lines can return can be made
 

87
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,229
these two lines can return can be made
into single line which is

88
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
into single line which is
 

89
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:35,190
into single line which is
r equals

90
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200

 

91
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,070

you see you see the least two line can

92
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
you see you see the least two line can
 

93
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,710
you see you see the least two line can
can be

94
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
can be
 

95
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,350
can be
changed into these yeah doesn't make

96
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
changed into these yeah doesn't make
 

97
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,750
changed into these yeah doesn't make
sense

98
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
sense
 

99
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,070

doesn't this need to decline no no no

100
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
doesn't this need to decline no no no
 

101
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,270
doesn't this need to decline no no no
that's what i mean if you

102
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
that's what i mean if you
 

103
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,910
that's what i mean if you
define you're defining a function it's

104
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
define you're defining a function it's
 

105
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,030
define you're defining a function it's
all you can

106
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
all you can
 

107
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,110
all you can
change this to is all which is a number

108
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
change this to is all which is a number
 

109
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,229
change this to is all which is a number
function lambda

110
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
function lambda
 

111
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,790
function lambda
n n is a parameter what does it return

112
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
n n is a parameter what does it return
 

113
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,270
n n is a parameter what does it return
and

114
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
and
 

115
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,110
and
and one and and one actually actually

116
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
and one and and one actually actually
 

117
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,430
and one and and one actually actually
because

118
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
because
 

119
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,509
because
actually there's a slightly mistake and

120
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
actually there's a slightly mistake and
 

121
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,750
actually there's a slightly mistake and
one is return one and zero so it's

122
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
one is return one and zero so it's
 

123
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,030
one is return one and zero so it's
better to

124
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
better to
 

125
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,190
better to
check if it's one okay yeah yeah

126
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,200
check if it's one okay yeah yeah
 

127
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,470
check if it's one okay yeah yeah

right
 

133
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,270
right
yeah okay okay so given a three number

134
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
yeah okay okay so given a three number
 

135
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,589
yeah okay okay so given a three number
uh

136
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
uh
 

137
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,710
uh
uh a few numbers in array one

138
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
uh a few numbers in array one
 

139
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,229
uh a few numbers in array one
five seven two six

140
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
five seven two six
 

141
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,830
five seven two six
you need to tell me it's four because

142
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
you need to tell me it's four because
 

143
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,229
you need to tell me it's four because
there's no consecutive three numbers

144
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
there's no consecutive three numbers
 

145
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:30,710
there's no consecutive three numbers
which

146
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
which
 

147
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,830
which
which is e doesn't need to be three

148
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
which is e doesn't need to be three
 

149
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,030
which is e doesn't need to be three
all right because i say so okay okay

150
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
all right because i say so okay okay
 

151
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,149
all right because i say so okay okay
i don't know okay there we go one if i

152
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
i don't know okay there we go one if i
 

153
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,990
i don't know okay there we go one if i
put a three here

154
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
put a three here
 

155
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,509
put a three here
then you need to tell me it's true

156
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
then you need to tell me it's true
 

157
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,430
then you need to tell me it's true
because 135

158
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
because 135
 

159
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,509
because 135
is a consecutive number it doesn't have

160
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
is a consecutive number it doesn't have
 

161
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,110
is a consecutive number it doesn't have
to be two two three

162
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
to be two two three
 

163
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,390
to be two two three
seven yeah yeah you can have uh eleven

164
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
seven yeah yeah you can have uh eleven
 

165
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,390
seven yeah yeah you can have uh eleven
that's still tens of three consecutive

166
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
that's still tens of three consecutive
 

167
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,470
that's still tens of three consecutive
numbers three yeah

168
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
numbers three yeah
 

169
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,630
numbers three yeah
i need three continuous continuous so

170
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
i need three continuous continuous so
 

171

not exactly the greedy but how can you
check what's the anger anymore

182
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
check what's the anger anymore
 

183

the beginning is the odd number
he goes to the next one and there's

he goes to the next one and there's
 

189
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,590
he goes to the next one and there's
still our own

190
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
still our own
 

191
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:31,140
still our own

let's can three contains consecutive

200
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
let's can three contains consecutive
 

201
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,590
let's can three contains consecutive
numbers it is the

202
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
numbers it is the

then if and
 

227
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,310
then if and
smaller than there is three numbers all

228
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
smaller than there is three numbers all
 

229

zero y minus two i minus two okay
 

291
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,830
zero y minus two i minus two okay
because we start with the second one

292
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840

right alternative you want plus one and
 

295
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,950
right alternative you want plus one and

296
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
plus two you can do this
 

297
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,070
plus two you can do this
start with zero and up to m minus

298

299
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,830

300
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
two right correctly yeah
 

301
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,469
two right correctly yeah
this is all this is this also okay

302
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
this is all this is this also okay
 

303
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,990
this is all this is this also okay
because this n minus 2

304
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
because this n minus 2
 

305
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,710
because this n minus 2
up is n minus 1 up to n minus 1 and

up is n minus 1 up to n minus 1 and

311
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,749
minus 1 plus 2
n minus 1 plus 2 so uh

312
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
n minus 1 plus 2 so uh
 

313
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,830
n minus 1 plus 2 so uh
is it n minus 2 or minus 3

314
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840

 

315
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,950

up to up to look i
 

317
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,990
up to up to look i
will become 0 2

318
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
will become 0 2
 

319
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,870
will become 0 2
to m minus one maximum right because oh

320
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
to m minus one maximum right because oh
 

321
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,510
to m minus one maximum right because oh
no no n minus three maximum

322
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
no no n minus three maximum
 

323
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,309
no no n minus three maximum
right because n minus two is bigger than

324
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
right because n minus two is bigger than
 

325
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,189
right because n minus two is bigger than
minus three so

326
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
minus three so
 

327
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,990
minus three so
n minus three plus two is minus one the

328
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
n minus three plus two is minus one the
 

329
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,390
n minus three plus two is minus one the

between the third and the only below
 

367
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,469
between the third and the only below
yeah i know so every time because you

368
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
yeah i know so every time because you
 

369
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,670
yeah i know so every time because you
have a slight

370
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
have a slight
 

371
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,509
have a slight
sliding window of three and this number

372
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
sliding window of three and this number
 

373
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,829
sliding window of three and this number
the wind in the window will be three

374
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
the wind in the window will be three
 

375
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,269
the wind in the window will be three
times right

376
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
times right
 

377
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,230
times right
there will be three windows right one

378
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
there will be three windows right one
 

379
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,030
there will be three windows right one
two

380
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
two
 

381
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,150
two
three right all right so 11

382
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
three right all right so 11
 

383
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,070
three right all right so 11
has appeared in three windows what does

384
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
has appeared in three windows what does
 

385
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,990
has appeared in three windows what does
it mean it's all function needs to check

386
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
it mean it's all function needs to check
 

387
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,829
it mean it's all function needs to check
it three times

388
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
it three times
 

389
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,150
it three times
yeah does it make sense can we do better

390
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
yeah does it make sense can we do better
 

391
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,829
yeah does it make sense can we do better
without checking without checking

392
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
without checking without checking
 

393
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,990
without checking without checking
three times check the last one

394
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
three times check the last one
 

395
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,750
three times check the last one
we just check the first three then

396
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
we just check the first three then
 

397
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,310
we just check the first three then
we don't need to check these to eject

398
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
we don't need to check these to eject
 

399
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,509
we don't need to check these to eject
this one

400
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
this one
 

401
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,389
this one
yeah so first we check all of them and

402
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
yeah so first we check all of them and
 

403
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:20,949
yeah so first we check all of them and
and then

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,670
keep moving but how do you
yeah but how do you change this to make

410
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
yeah but how do you change this to make
 

411
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,630
yeah but how do you change this to make
this work

412
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
this work
 

413
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,550
this work
how do you make it work kind of similar

414
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
how do you make it work kind of similar
 

415
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:34,870
how do you make it work kind of similar
but

416
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
but
 

417
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,310
but
yeah because listen hey

yeah because listen hey
 

419
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,710
yeah because listen hey
how about we we have a counter we have

420
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
how about we we have a counter we have
 

421
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,110
how about we we have a counter we have
we remember the current

422
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
we remember the current
 

423
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,990
we remember the current
consecutive odd number count right so

424
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
consecutive odd number count right so
 

425
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,350
consecutive odd number count right so
look

426
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
look
 

427
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,269
look
yeah all right look look on all number

428
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
yeah all right look look on all number
 

429
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,110
yeah all right look look on all number
counter plus one all number

430
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
counter plus one all number
 

431
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,790
counter plus one all number
quarter plus one all number

432
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
quarter plus one all number
 

433
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,150
quarter plus one all number
counter plus one all number counter plus

434
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
counter plus one all number counter plus
 

435
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,590
counter plus one all number counter plus
one

436
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
one
 

437
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,150
one
even number we set it to zero

438
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
even number we set it to zero
 

439
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,030
even number we set it to zero
does that make sense yeah so we have

440
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
does that make sense yeah so we have
 

441
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,509
does that make sense yeah so we have
this number to cut to

442
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
this number to cut to
 

443
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,150
this number to cut to
to count how many consecutive num even

444
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160
to count how many consecutive num even
 

445
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,550
to count how many consecutive num even
them

446
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
them
 

447
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,190
them
or number we haven't met so far we have

448
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
or number we haven't met so far we have
 

449
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,069
or number we haven't met so far we have
seen so far

450
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
seen so far
 

451
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,550
seen so far
and then at the meantime if it's more

452

and then at the meantime if it's more
 

453
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,190
and then at the meantime if it's more
than

454
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
than
 

455
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,310
than
we caught a maximum of it right

456
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
we caught a maximum of it right
 

457
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,630

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,150

zero

506
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
zero
 

507
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,870
zero
and then at the end we check this next

508
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
and then at the end we check this next
 

509
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,389
and then at the end we check this next
part

510
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
part
 

511
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,230
part
if it's bigger or you go to three when

512
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
if it's bigger or you go to three when
 

513
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,750
if it's bigger or you go to three when
it's two right

514
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
it's two right
 

515
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,150
it's two right
yeah doesn't make sense and each number

516
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
yeah doesn't make sense and each number
 

517
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,230
yeah doesn't make sense and each number
we only check ones right

518
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
we only check ones right
 

519
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,930
we only check ones right
yeah okay let's light it you got it

520
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:10,940
yeah okay let's light it you got it
 

521
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,069
yeah okay let's light it you got it

be fine check
numbs what what's missing

526
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
numbs what what's missing
 

527
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,949

okay

528
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959

 

529
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,629

uh odd equals zero right

530
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
uh odd equals zero right
 

531
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,910
uh odd equals zero right
and then max

532
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
and then max
 

533
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,829
and then max
bot equals zero as well look at it

534
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
bot equals zero as well look at it
 

535
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,030

for i in
 

537
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,949
for i in
nouns what's missing

00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
e anyway is odd if it's odd
 

541
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,949
e anyway is odd if it's odd
i what should i do here if it's all i

542
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
i what should i do here if it's all i
 

543
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:47,750
i what should i do here if it's all i
will do

544
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
will do
 

545
00:12:47,760 --> 00:13:05,350
will do
oh we just implement one

546
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360

 

547
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,710

and what means of all one

548
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
and what means of all one
 

549
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,629
and what means of all one
of the next o and what

550
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
of the next o and what
 

551
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,790
