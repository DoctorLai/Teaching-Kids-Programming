1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,800
yeah listen to me yeah so keep in the

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,559
pineapple yeah one

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,120
it doesn't matter what values we are

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,039
putting in all right that system

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,000
we don't need to put the values here the

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,000
binary is three

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,400
what's the longest part remember we

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,119
talked about the longest even process

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,680
long

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,680
longest

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,719
even

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,480
five okay so let's get rid of this even

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,800
today so we want to find out the longest

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:42,000
path six six six six six

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,360
okay let's say nothing two one two

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,160
four

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,200
four five that's the way

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,719
okay

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,559
so okay

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,120
i like it

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,199
yeah so what's up two one three four

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,399
five six two one three four five yeah

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,239
that's the longest yes okay so yes we

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,520
talk about the longest even pass yeah

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,760
last time yeah

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,320
and then we can we use the same

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,720
algorithm to solve this problem yeah

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,640
obviously if if we don't check the even

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,680
if it's even then you still work right

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,200
so we can use that research right yeah

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,520
so you still remember what what

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,840
difference search i mean

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,600
do we use i mean what kind of data

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,040
search i mean how can we implement the

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,240
different search

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,240
okay so let's review this

37
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,280
yeah let's level by level and another

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,479
way of doing this step for search is one

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,640
two six

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,320
three four five nine okay

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,200
and then we cushion we use the stacks

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,960
okay four five nine okay

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,360
okay so let's let's say

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,360
if we define these three differences

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,439
dfs search rules so what is what's your

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,159
in return can you tell me what you in

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,159
return remember

48
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
yeah

49
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,079
can you find that pen

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,000
i'm running out of time

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,000
what's that what's that what's this

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,280
okay so what's the return what's the

53
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,120
definition returning i mean

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,599
okay okay ryan mary

55
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,599
what's the deficit lose what would you

56
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,599
attend

57
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,680
what if i said this different search

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,879
will return the longest path okay

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,879
longest path

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,879
starting from this one one three four

61
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:40,160
five so how many notes are there four

62
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,160
okay yeah that's good

63
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,280
and okay so it returns that bit

64
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,920
right

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,959
so how about if i tell you that if i

66
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,480
tell you that okay so this bit this bit

67
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,599
here if this bit here is stefan search

68
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,120
blue

69
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,080
dot left

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,400
and let's say put it as air and this bit

71
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,400
is

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,879
that first search

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,200
bluetooth white

74
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,319
and let's put it as r

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,440
okay

76
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,360
yeah

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,000
this is l l b l will be two right bit

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,120
will be three right so l will be two

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
here

80
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,080
i'll be three okay

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,640
so what's the longest path

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,720
what's the longest pass

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,560
so what's what's the longest path that

84
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,360
passing through the

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,640
root one here

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,680
longest part passing passing to the root

87
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,720
one

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,720
what's the number start

89
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:48,000
six yeah what how do we get a six

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,920
how do we get a six oh we just how do we

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,120
get sick this bit is two

92
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,239
plus one

93
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,159
plus this bit three okay make sense yeah

94
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,439
yeah okay so then we can write this yeah

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,319
look that percentage root is the longest

96
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,280
that starting with this note okay right

97
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,599
starting with now so here you'll be

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,439
four right and attack this this bit is

99
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,000
stefan search new done right this is big

100
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,640
it's definitely search to the left right

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,120
so the common part like the longest the

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,479
path that's passing through the root

103
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,079
will be one yeah we have one note

104
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,320
and the last bit

105
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,040
the right bit right

106
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,120
yeah so this function remember this

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,840
function does two things

108
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,120
first thing it replaces the longest path

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:39,440
starting with this load right so you

110
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,520
and the second thing is that it needs to

111
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,960
compute the longest part yeah you

112
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,800
compare them you stole the maximum

113
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,400
number of notes that passing through

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,120
that root okay

115
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,080
so that's two things

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,840
uh i know we can just write it okay uh

117
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,840
let me just write it here

118
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,440
therefore search

119
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,680
therefore search that loot okay

120
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,240
if not

121
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,240
return what

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,720
and what's next

123
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,120
right equals one

124
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,120
y

125
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,520
and then in order to access the answer i

126
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,080
need to put it as a language

127
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,800
answer i mean okay because this is

128
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,639
inside a function i want to

129
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,400
i want to say okay this function this

130
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,000
answer here is the answer here so i put

131
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,720
a long local form

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,120
and then i need to do this answer equals

133
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,440
maximum of answer

134
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,000
can you complete this

135
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,120
so what's the what's here look

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,199
what's the

137
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,880
path what's the number what's the number

138
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,840
of notes that passing through the root

139
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,840
here

140
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,000
and one okay left right and one okay but

141
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,199
now this function needs to return what

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,840
we turn the longest so look here

143
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,680
here like this is left bit here this is

144
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,360
vibrate at least

145
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,280
this function should return the number

146
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,120
that makes the longest path that's

147
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,759
starting with this now so it could be

148
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,639
picking the maximum above both yeah so

149
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,639
what's your return

150
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,039
one plus one

151
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,280
the biggest one so the maximum of one

152
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,400
left and right right and that's all

153
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,400
right okay yeah

154
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,319
so for this one the time complexity is

155
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,400
our what if and not

156
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,560
don't don't do that

157
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,560
if that knows what's the term complexity

158
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,639
the number of nodes that visited because

159
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,720
we visited each node exactly once okay

160
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,560
yeah so look

161
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,599
quite similar yeah

162
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,479
last time last time what we did

163
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,639
last time what did we do before we last

164
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,039
last time we need to check

165
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,680
if here we need to check if the load is

166
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,680
even then we need to do this otherwise

167
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,080
if it's all number then return

168
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,080
zero because it's all number right but

169
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,560
now we just get rid of if

170
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,720
here right so everything will be

171
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,880
still be the same the death research you

172
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,440
see yeah the longest path okay so let's

173
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,280
not be it today so today actually this

174
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,440
is not new we actually this is something

175
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,960
that we have we know how to solve before

176
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,080
right so we just get rid of that

177
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,080
condition even pass right and then this

178
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,919
way we can check

179
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,680
we can compute the longest path between

180
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,400
any two nodes

181
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,400
yeah okay that's a bit that's it today

182
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,400
bye
