5
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,909
okay so today we talked about the final
three okay i i will draw a binary okay

6
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:07,919
three okay i i will draw a binary okay
 

7
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,150
three okay i i will draw a binary okay
here ten

three
so this is the parameter and how many

18
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
so this is the parameter and how many
 

19
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,670
so this is the parameter and how many
ways if we want to remove one edge from

20
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
ways if we want to remove one edge from
 

21
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,670
ways if we want to remove one edge from
from this manager

22
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,680
from this manager
 

23
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,550
from this manager
how many ways

24
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560

 

25
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,589

right

26
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
right
 

27
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,470
right
um

28
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
um
 

29
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,349
um
four

30
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
four
 

31
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,470
four
four four edges four possibilities so

32
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
four four edges four possibilities so
 

33
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,549
four four edges four possibilities so
what happens if i remove one edge what

34
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
what happens if i remove one edge what
 

35
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,030
what happens if i remove one edge what
happened what do you get what do we get

36
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
happened what do you get what do we get
 

37
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,350
happened what do you get what do we get
two threes we remove one edge yeah we

38
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
two threes we remove one edge yeah we
 

39
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,030
two threes we remove one edge yeah we
move one edge

40
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
move one edge
 

41
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,750
move one edge
one add two trees

42
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
one add two trees
 

43
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,590
one add two trees
two threes

44
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
two threes
 

45
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,990
two threes
you have financing what uh

46
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
you have financing what uh
 

47
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,910
you have financing what uh
if it's too balanced you what do we also

48
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
if it's too balanced you what do we also
 

49
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,189
if it's too balanced you what do we also
call it

50
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199

 

51
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,910

what do we also call it

52
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:53,920
what do we also call it
 

53
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,310
what do we also call it
forest forest yeah okay

54
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
forest forest yeah okay
 

55
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,189
forest forest yeah okay
this is a concept so if i removed one

56
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
this is a concept so if i removed one
 

57
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,430
this is a concept so if i removed one
edges and we want to find out if it's

58
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
edges and we want to find out if it's
 

59
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,990
edges and we want to find out if it's
possible that for the these two binary

60
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
possible that for the these two binary
 

61
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,990
possible that for the these two binary
trees to have the same

62
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
trees to have the same
 

63
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,789
trees to have the same
uh

64
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
uh
 

65
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,350
uh
total sum okay

66
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
total sum okay
 

67
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,190
total sum okay
so for example in this case if i remove

68
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
so for example in this case if i remove
 

69
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,830
so for example in this case if i remove
this edge what happened the sum of these

70
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
this edge what happened the sum of these
 

71
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,190
this edge what happened the sum of these
15 15 and the sum of these

72
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
15 15 and the sum of these
 

73
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,230
15 15 and the sum of these
15 yeah yeah okay if it's not possible

74
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
15 yeah yeah okay if it's not possible
 

75
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,830
15 yeah yeah okay if it's not possible
just to move

76
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
just to move
 

77
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,030
just to move
for example this is a thousand then

78
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
for example this is a thousand then
 

79
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,550
for example this is a thousand then
apparently it's not possible then we

80
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
apparently it's not possible then we
 

81
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,469
apparently it's not possible then we
just return false

82
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
just return false
 

83
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,230
just return false
okay so given the final entry do we

84
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
okay so given the final entry do we
 

85
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,469
okay so given the final entry do we
still remember how do we calculate sum

86
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
still remember how do we calculate sum
 

87
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,109
still remember how do we calculate sum
in the recursion the definition remember

88
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
in the recursion the definition remember
 

89
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,870
in the recursion the definition remember
define the sum

90
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
define the sum
 

91
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,830
define the sum
yeah the definition sum definitely if

92
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
yeah the definition sum definitely if
 

93
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,789
yeah the definition sum definitely if
this is the load okay so it's very easy

94
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
this is the load okay so it's very easy
 

95
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,749
this is the load okay so it's very easy
right right can you tell me if not load

96
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
right right can you tell me if not load
 

97
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,590
right right can you tell me if not load
if load is empty what happened what

98
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
if load is empty what happened what
 

99
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,670
if load is empty what happened what
should we pretend

100
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680

 

101
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,109

some return one

102
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119

 

103
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,190

is empty what's the sum what's the sum

104
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
is empty what's the sum what's the sum
 

105
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,749
is empty what's the sum what's the sum
of the empty

106
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
of the empty
 

107
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,670
of the empty
come on it's nothing nothing what was

108
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
come on it's nothing nothing what was
 

109
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,550
come on it's nothing nothing what was
your return the sum the sum of the z

110
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
your return the sum the sum of the z
 

111
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,790
your return the sum the sum of the z
yeah yeah come on otherwise

112
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800

 

113
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,029

yeah therefore search what

114
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
yeah therefore search what
 

115
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,430
yeah therefore search what
and look this is a tree

116
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
and look this is a tree
 

117
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,190
and look this is a tree
yeah this is a tree

118
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
yeah this is a tree
 

119
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,910
yeah this is a tree
this is a see any and uh i don't i don't

120
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
this is a see any and uh i don't i don't
 

121
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,390
this is a see any and uh i don't i don't
care all right again this is a tree it

122
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
care all right again this is a tree it
 

123
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,630
care all right again this is a tree it
has the left tree at y 3

124
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
has the left tree at y 3
 

125
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,550
has the left tree at y 3
and if it's not empty

126
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
and if it's not empty
 

127
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,110
and if it's not empty
the sum of all of these

128
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
the sum of all of these
 

129
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,390
the sum of all of these
equals 1

130
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
equals 1
 

131
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,430
equals 1
equals root of value

132
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
equals root of value
 

133
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,430
equals root of value
is this one plus

134
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
is this one plus
 

135
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,030
is this one plus
what's this b what's the sum of this

136
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
what's this b what's the sum of this
 

137
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,589

talking about
 

143
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,550
talking about
now i want to calculate the sum of this

144
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
now i want to calculate the sum of this
 

145
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,110
now i want to calculate the sum of this
financing right if it's empty i return

146
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
financing right if it's empty i return
 

147
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,670
financing right if it's empty i return
zero which is the base cases

148
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
zero which is the base cases
 

149
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,949
zero which is the base cases
if it's not zero auntie and it equals

150
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
if it's not zero auntie and it equals
 

151
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,869
if it's not zero auntie and it equals
the sum of these bit

152
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
the sum of these bit
 

153
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,589

come on what do you thought

172
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
come on what do you thought
 

173
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,470
come on what do you thought
that message because we're calling

174
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
that message because we're calling
 

175
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,509
that message because we're calling
itself to to solve to get the sum of the

176
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
itself to to solve to get the sum of the
 

177
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,589
itself to to solve to get the sum of the
left tree yeah and then definitely

178
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
left tree yeah and then definitely
 

179
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,990
left tree yeah and then definitely
search blue dot right right

180
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
search blue dot right right
 

181
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,190
search blue dot right right
right

182
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
right
 

183
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,550
right
and then return as yeah this is the

184
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
and then return as yeah this is the
 

185
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,270
and then return as yeah this is the
we have we have used this before to

186
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
we have we have used this before to
 

187
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,550
we have we have used this before to
compute this

188
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
compute this
 

189
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,910
compute this
the sum

190
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
the sum
 

191
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,869
the sum
yeah the sum of the binary tree we have

192
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
yeah the sum of the binary tree we have
 

193
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,149
yeah the sum of the binary tree we have
final tree

194
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
final tree
 

195
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,789
final tree
using the recursion data search right

196
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
using the recursion data search right
 

197
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,190
using the recursion data search right
okay so if i

198
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
okay so if i
 

199
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,670
okay so if i
put it if i put the sum okay so based on

200
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
put it if i put the sum okay so based on
 

201
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,190
put it if i put the sum okay so based on
this

202
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
this
 

203
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,390
this
let's let's

204
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
let's let's
 

205
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:56,070
let's let's
do this uh tree again

206
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080

 

207
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,270

so if i have a scene which is stores the

208
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
so if i have a scene which is stores the
 

209
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,710
so if i have a scene which is stores the
number of

210
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
number of
 

211
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,229
number of
the sum the sum we have seen so far okay

212
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
the sum the sum we have seen so far okay
 

213
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,110
the sum the sum we have seen so far okay
so

214
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
so
 

215
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,869
so
what do you think it will contain the

216
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
what do you think it will contain the
 

217
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,110
what do you think it will contain the
scene

218
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
scene
 

219
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,270
scene
uh if i put it here

220
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
uh if i put it here
 

221
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,550
uh if i put it here

attention come on

230
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600

if this s
return s what's this as this is the sum

234
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
return s what's this as this is the sum
 

235
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,550
return s what's this as this is the sum
of any

236
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
of any
 

237
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,990
of any
of any sub trees any subtree including

238
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
of any sub trees any subtree including
 

239
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,990
of any sub trees any subtree including
itself in this manner yeah and we want

240
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
itself in this manner yeah and we want
 

241
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,550
itself in this manner yeah and we want
to be called we want to remember sim dot

242
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
to be called we want to remember sim dot
 

243
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,510
to be called we want to remember sim dot
append we want to push the sum to this

244
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
append we want to push the sum to this
 

245
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,550
append we want to push the sum to this
so

246
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
so
 

247
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,790
so
how many such trees are there how many

248
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
how many such trees are there how many
 

249
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,150
how many such trees are there how many
subtrees

250
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
subtrees
 

251
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,990
subtrees
how many three subtrees are there

252
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
how many three subtrees are there
 

253
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,590
how many three subtrees are there
five

254
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
five
 

255
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,390
five
what are the subtrees two yeah this is

256
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
what are the subtrees two yeah this is
 

257
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,070
what are the subtrees two yeah this is
subject

258
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
subject
 

259
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,430
subject
three

260
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
three
 

261
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,510
three
and what else

262
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
and what else
 

263
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,710
and what else
ten

264
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
ten
 

265
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,710
ten
there's why isn't ten sub trees

266
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
there's why isn't ten sub trees
 

267
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,150
there's why isn't ten sub trees
including the left three and y three

268
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
including the left three and y three
 

269
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,469
including the left three and y three
because look s is the root of value plus

270
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
because look s is the root of value plus
 

271
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,710
because look s is the root of value plus
the sum of that tree and sum of right

272
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
the sum of that tree and sum of right
 

273
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,670
the sum of that tree and sum of right
tree right

274
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
tree right
 

275
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,710
tree right
right so two three is a sub tree ten

276
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
right so two three is a sub tree ten
 

277
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,629
right so two three is a sub tree ten
plus two plus five three yeah this is a

278
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
plus two plus five three yeah this is a
 

279
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,310
plus two plus five three yeah this is a
sub tree yeah you cannot you need to

280
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
sub tree yeah you cannot you need to
 

281
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,830
sub tree yeah you cannot you need to
pick all its

282
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
pick all its
 

283
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,790
pick all its
children right descendants right

284
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
children right descendants right
 

285
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,870
children right descendants right
so this is fifteen and what's the

286
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
so this is fifteen and what's the
 

287
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,230
so this is fifteen and what's the
subtree of this one

288
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
subtree of this one
 

289
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,390
subtree of this one
thirty and what's the subtree any out of

290
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
thirty and what's the subtree any out of
 

291
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,749
thirty and what's the subtree any out of
searching

292
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759

 

293
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,150

is this a sub 35

294
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
is this a sub 35
 

295
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,270
is this a sub 35
yeah

296
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
yeah
 

297
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,310
yeah
okay so after this we've got this right

298
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
okay so after this we've got this right
 

299
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,430
okay so after this we've got this right
yeah

300
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
yeah
 

301
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,270
yeah
and we do want to remove the uh 30 30 is

302
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
and we do want to remove the uh 30 30 is
 

303
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,189
and we do want to remove the uh 30 30 is
actually the last one because when you

304
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
actually the last one because when you
 

305
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,550
actually the last one because when you
do this recursion the last last

306
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
do this recursion the last last
 

307
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,670
do this recursion the last last
which value is the last s if which value

308
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
which value is the last s if which value
 

309
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,590
which value is the last s if which value
is the last edge

310
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
is the last edge
 

311
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,830
is the last edge
i append this so if i call tfs root what

312
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
i append this so if i call tfs root what
 

313
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,909
i append this so if i call tfs root what
do you think what do you think

314
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
do you think what do you think
 

315
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,309
do you think what do you think
what's the last value of s

316
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319

 

317
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,909

dfs boot

318
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
dfs boot
 

319
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,530
dfs boot
what does dfs rule return

320
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:07,540
what does dfs rule return
 

321
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,270
what does dfs rule return
[Music]

322
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280

 

323
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,590

the sum of the whole tree right and the

324
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
the sum of the whole tree right and the
 

325
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,909
the sum of the whole tree right and the
sum of the whole tree cinder append s so

326
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
sum of the whole tree cinder append s so
 

327
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,990
sum of the whole tree cinder append s so
the last element would be the sum of

328
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
the last element would be the sum of
 

329
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,510
the last element would be the sum of
whole tree which is 30 right yes

330
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
whole tree which is 30 right yes

am i right
what is the minus 5

334
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
what is the minus 5
 

335
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,029
what is the minus 5
no no okay okay so look this is 90

336
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
no no okay okay so look this is 90
 

337
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,230
no no okay okay so look this is 90
and what's the half of it it is

338
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
and what's the half of it it is
 

339
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,430
and what's the half of it it is
15

340
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
15
 

341
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,189
15
that's right okay so look this whole

342
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
that's right okay so look this whole
 

343
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,230
that's right okay so look this whole
tree the sum is 30. and if i split into

344
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
tree the sum is 30. and if i split into
 

345
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,870
tree the sum is 30. and if i split into
two and if they're equal what's if they

346
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
two and if they're equal what's if they
 

347
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,670
two and if they're equal what's if they
are equal what's the sum of that half

348
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680

 

349
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,670

and the

350
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680

 

351
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,670

yeah i know that's 30.

352
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
yeah i know that's 30.
 

353
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,629
yeah i know that's 30.
now i know what let's i know these is

354
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
now i know what let's i know these is
 

355
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,830
now i know what let's i know these is
sin

356
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
sin
 

357
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,749
sin
minus one right

358
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
minus one right
 

359
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,990
minus one right
right i know this is as thin rather if i

360
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
right i know this is as thin rather if i
 

361
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,230
right i know this is as thin rather if i
divide it by two

362
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
divide it by two
 

363
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,189
divide it by two
i mean

364
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
i mean
 

365
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,350
i mean
what's the sum what's the sum if i

366
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
what's the sum what's the sum if i
 

367
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,510
what's the sum what's the sum if i
divide by two if not two both threes are

368
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
divide by two if not two both threes are
 

369
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,790
divide by two if not two both threes are
equal

370
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800

 

371
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,350

um

372
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360

 

373
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,990

divided by 215 right if i get rid of

374
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
divided by 215 right if i get rid of
 

375
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,350
divided by 215 right if i get rid of
these

376
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
these
 

377
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,629
these
and

378
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
and
 

379
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,710
and
and i want to know

380
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
and i want to know
 

381
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,589
and i want to know
if there's a tree if the number

382
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
if there's a tree if the number
 

383
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,790
if there's a tree if the number
in the rest

384
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
in the rest
 

385
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,909
in the rest
which is equal to half of 30.

386
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
which is equal to half of 30.
 

387
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,110
which is equal to half of 30.
correct

388
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
correct
 

389
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,029
correct
yeah if it is then we find a solution

390
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
yeah if it is then we find a solution
 

391
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,430
yeah if it is then we find a solution
got it doesn't make sense

392
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
got it doesn't make sense
 

393
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,309
got it doesn't make sense
yeah then you know about the other ones

394
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
yeah then you know about the other ones
 

395
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,490
yeah then you know about the other ones
what do you mean the other one

396
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:39,500
what do you mean the other one
 

397
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,589
what do you mean the other one

five and ten

400
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
five and ten
 

401
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,270
five and ten
and 10. yeah how about that yeah yeah

402
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
and 10. yeah how about that yeah yeah
 

403
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,469
and 10. yeah how about that yeah yeah
yeah look 5 and 10. this is 15 how do we

404
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
yeah look 5 and 10. this is 15 how do we
 

405
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,909
yeah look 5 and 10. this is 15 how do we
get 15

406
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
get 15
 

407
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,390
get 15
it's 10 plus 2 plus 3

408
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
it's 10 plus 2 plus 3
 

409
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,510
it's 10 plus 2 plus 3
right

410
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
right
 

411
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,790
right
and then

412
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
and then
 

413
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,110
and then
you cannot pick 10 and 5 to get you need

414
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
you cannot pick 10 and 5 to get you need
 

415
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,950
you cannot pick 10 and 5 to get you need
to pick 10 if you lace the left tree you

416
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
to pick 10 if you lace the left tree you
 

417
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,589
to pick 10 if you lace the left tree you
need to pick it and it lets you in right

418
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
need to pick it and it lets you in right
 

419
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,029
need to pick it and it lets you in right
three you need to pick it that's why i

420
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
three you need to pick it that's why i
 

421
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,110
three you need to pick it that's why i
look s equals root of value plus the

422
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
look s equals root of value plus the
 

423
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,390
look s equals root of value plus the
left three plus the right three the sum

424
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
left three plus the right three the sum
 

425
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,909
left three plus the right three the sum
sum of left three and the sum right

426
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
sum of left three and the sum right
 

427
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,510
sum of left three and the sum right
three you need to the whole sub tree you

428
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
three you need to the whole sub tree you
 

429
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,390
three you need to the whole sub tree you
cannot

430
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
cannot
 

431
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,869
cannot
you cannot just pick these two and we

432
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
you cannot just pick these two and we
 

433
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,790
you cannot just pick these two and we
ignore the right sub tree right because

434
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
ignore the right sub tree right because
 

435
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,950
ignore the right sub tree right because
it's there and then we we append all the

436
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
it's there and then we we append all the
 

437
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,070
it's there and then we we append all the
possible subtree sums into s

438
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
possible subtree sums into s
 

439
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,309
possible subtree sums into s
right and the last one is the sub tree

440
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
right and the last one is the sub tree
 

441
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,189
right and the last one is the sub tree
it's the sum of all every node

442
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
it's the sum of all every node
 

443
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,629
it's the sum of all every node
if we do this uh s look if these

444
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
if we do this uh s look if these
 

445
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,949
if we do this uh s look if these
let's do this step search and then stop

457
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,790
which is the sum of all sub 3 right
and then we just need to find out if the

458
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
and then we just need to find out if the

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
divided by 2 yeah and we look if t
 

463
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,350
divided by 2 yeah and we look if t
divided by two in in what in this scene

if it's in the scene
 

471
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,269
if it's in the scene
if we have everything in the c it means

472
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
if we have everything in the c it means
 

473
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,750
if we have everything in the c it means
that we can find a way to split the

474
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
that we can find a way to split the
 

475
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,030
that we can find a way to split the
planetary into half and both have the

476
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
planetary into half and both have the
 

477
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,470
planetary into half and both have the
same the equal sum

478
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
same the equal sum
 

479
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,870
same the equal sum
okay

481
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,110

okay doesn't make sense

482
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
okay doesn't make sense
 

483
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,430
okay doesn't make sense
what's the time complexity

484
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
what's the time complexity
 

485
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,949
what's the time complexity
um

486
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
um
 

487
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:26,949
um
yeah because we we need to visit what

yeah why is that
yeah we a good job

498
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
yeah we a good job
 

499
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,430
yeah we a good job
and also we smell the stack yeah stack

500
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
and also we smell the stack yeah stack
 

501
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,190
and also we smell the stack yeah stack
recursion okay

502
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
recursion okay

recursion okay
okay

504
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
okay
 

505
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,030
okay
okay can you explain to me how what's

506
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
okay can you explain to me how what's
 

507
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,269
okay can you explain to me how what's
the how what's how do we solve this just

508
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
the how what's how do we solve this just
 

509
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,590
the how what's how do we solve this just
make sure you understand

510
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600

 

511
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,949

yeah

512
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
yeah
 

513
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,180
yeah
yeah and

514
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,190
yeah and
 

515
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,829
yeah and
[Music]

516
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839

 

517
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,230

say sorry yes okay

518
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
say sorry yes okay
 

519
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,150
say sorry yes okay
be quiet

520
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
be quiet
 

521
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,509
be quiet
yes

522
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
yes
 

523
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,870
yes
um

524
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
um
 

525
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,350
um
we're just adding olive

526
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
we're just adding olive
 

527
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,710
we're just adding olive
and we're just doing all of the subtrees

528
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
and we're just doing all of the subtrees
 

529
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,590
and we're just doing all of the subtrees
substitute sums into the scene yeah and

530
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
substitute sums into the scene yeah and
 

531
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,509
substitute sums into the scene yeah and
you know the

532
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
you know the
 

533
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,990
you know the
deficit root yeah

534
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
deficit root yeah
 

535
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,870
deficit root yeah
then you just divide it by two and say

536
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
then you just divide it by two and say
 

537
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,790
then you just divide it by two and say
it if it's yeah yeah if it's in the

538
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
it if it's yeah yeah if it's in the
 

539
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,030
it if it's yeah yeah if it's in the
if there's a sub tree sum which equals

540
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
if there's a sub tree sum which equals
 

541
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,069
if there's a sub tree sum which equals
to half of the total sub trees what does

542
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
to half of the total sub trees what does
 

543
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,829
to half of the total sub trees what does
it mean

544
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
it mean
 

545
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,750
it mean
what does it mean

546
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
what does it mean
 

547
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,430
what does it mean
it means yeah it's true there's a way to

548
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
it means yeah it's true there's a way to
 

549
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,550
it means yeah it's true there's a way to
split to split to remove one x split the

550
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
split to split to remove one x split the
 

551
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,389
split to split to remove one x split the
final three into half right and then we

552
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
final three into half right and then we
 

553
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,110
final three into half right and then we
can find out the subtree sum right yeah

554
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
can find out the subtree sum right yeah
 

555
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,430
can find out the subtree sum right yeah
because this this method is quite

556
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
because this this method is quite
 

557
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,030
because this this method is quite
elegant right it's quite elegant

558
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
elegant right it's quite elegant
 

559
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,269
elegant right it's quite elegant
otherwise

560
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
otherwise
 

561
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,750
otherwise
sorry it's all really beautiful

562
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
sorry it's all really beautiful
 

563
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,829
sorry it's all really beautiful
beautiful yeah good job beautiful egg

beautiful yeah good job beautiful egg
 

565
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,350
beautiful yeah good job beautiful egg
yeah yeah good job look at this we

566
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
yeah yeah good job look at this we
 

567
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,230
yeah yeah good job look at this we
already know this right but i mean maybe

568
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
already know this right but i mean maybe
 

569
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,829
already know this right but i mean maybe
100 days ago we already learned the

570
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
100 days ago we already learned the
 

571
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,269
100 days ago we already learned the
recursion to compute the sum of a binary

572
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
recursion to compute the sum of a binary
 

573
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,670
recursion to compute the sum of a binary
tree right 100 days a day probably you

574
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
tree right 100 days a day probably you
 

575
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,550
tree right 100 days a day probably you
know look base case is empty within zero

576
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
know look base case is empty within zero
 

577
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,030
know look base case is empty within zero
otherwise what's the sum

578
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
otherwise what's the sum
 

579
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,030
otherwise what's the sum
the sum of these nodes and then we do

580
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
the sum of these nodes and then we do
 

581
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,790
the sum of these nodes and then we do
curse recording the solving the left

582
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
curse recording the solving the left
 

583
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,949
curse recording the solving the left
tree and right here and put it together

584
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
tree and right here and put it together
 

585
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,430
tree and right here and put it together
return s all we need to do all we do

586
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
return s all we need to do all we do
 

587
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,470
return s all we need to do all we do
today

588
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480

scene

590
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
scene
 

591
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,350
scene
and we'll put all the possible sum sub

592
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
and we'll put all the possible sum sub
 

593
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,350
and we'll put all the possible sum sub
three sums into the scene and the last

594
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
three sums into the scene and the last
 

595
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,910
three sums into the scene and the last
one would be the sum of all the notes

596
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
one would be the sum of all the notes
 

597
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,910
one would be the sum of all the notes
with the movie speed

598
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
with the movie speed
 

599
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,150
with the movie speed
and we compute the half of it right if

600
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
and we compute the half of it right if
 

601
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,710
and we compute the half of it right if
it's half of it if half of it is in

602
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
it's half of it if half of it is in
 

603
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,509
it's half of it if half of it is in
this in the uh in the list then

604
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
this in the uh in the list then
 

605
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,829
this in the uh in the list then
there's a way to split it into

606
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
there's a way to split it into
 

607
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,430
there's a way to split it into
easy the countdown

608
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
easy the countdown
 

609
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,509
easy the countdown
because we visited all the notes the

610
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
because we visited all the notes the
 

611
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,430
because we visited all the notes the
space somewhere because we use the theme

612
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
space somewhere because we use the theme
 

613
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,069
space somewhere because we use the theme
we use that stack yeah okay that's it

614
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
we use that stack yeah okay that's it
 

615
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,519
we use that stack yeah okay that's it
for today good job bye
