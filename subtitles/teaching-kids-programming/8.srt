2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,519
okay so

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,040
today we're going to talk about

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,759
different

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,600
different approach to check if a string

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,960
is a palindrome do you want to remember

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,039
this parenchyme

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,840
yeah right andrew lumen police

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,160
palindrome yeah paragrams you know

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,160
string or list or numbers what way is it

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,020
[Music]

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,120
okay good job okay

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,199
ryan to get it yeah what where is they

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,920
like

15
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,399
okay good job good job okay good job

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,600
yeah

17
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,159
yeah okay so here better so how do we

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,320
check if

19
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,760
a given let's say today we want to check

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,200
define

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,320
define is palindrome okay

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,119
per syndrome let's

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,240
take a string for example string so we

24
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,320
need to re

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,799
we need to check if the different string

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,880
is the parent so how do you check it

27
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,360
how do you check it do you have any any

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,090
other ideas how do we check if a string

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,169
is a pending germ

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,169
[Music]

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,840
how do you check it wait wait yeah you

32
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,840
got some idea

33
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,759
so how do we check it approach i mean

34
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,520
if given you're given a string like abc

35
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,960
how do you know if it's the parent or

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,000
not

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,200
cba yes that's a very good

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,479
uh hint so

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,119
it doesn't be the same abc

40
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,360
well there will be cbi yeah yeah yeah

41
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,840
reverse it good point so we reverse it

42
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,599
yeah we reverse it to check if it's

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,120
the same so how do we write it we can do

44
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,160
this return

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,440
return reverse reverse

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,640
this string if error

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,280
if it's the same as the input okay

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,400
that's one line of curve okay yes so how

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,640
do we check

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,480
yeah no no no no you need to define this

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,959
left so what is the graph

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,160
you can define another function right to

53
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,840
reverse it right

54
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,840
so how to reverse it

55
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,000
[Music]

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,560
remember the optional approach this easy

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,680
approach

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,080
like we can define the answer here first

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,599
of all

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,720
equals empty string then for

61
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,720
i in s

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,440
answer equals i plus angle yeah put it

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,720
put every character before the and

64
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,159
before it so it will be

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,159
reversed yeah return what

66
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,159
return reverse

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,440
return what this is a function return

68
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,560
what arms

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,840
yeah return answer

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,480
yeah that's easy how we in python we can

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,280
use a

72
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,879
much better quicker way look this

73
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,120
housing

74
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:32,159
can be replaced by what return

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,200
because look look carefully it's a very

76
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,080
special keyword s okay then what should

77
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,560
we do

78
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,560
bracket

79
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,640
column column minus one

80
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,319
okay it means reverse it okay so this

81
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,560
whole thing can be replaced

82
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,360
by python this means to reverse it why

83
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,040
does two

84
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:57,040
columns begin on a list sorry

85
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,439
why are there two columns

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,799
this is just a keyword any a string then

87
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,840
we can do it

88
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,599
this way then it means look if s is

89
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,439
a b c and these will become c b a

90
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:14,959
okay okay so that's one way of doing it

91
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,560
yes so

92
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,600
how do we i mean we this is one way of

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
doing that we

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,680
can also do it this way okay we can

95
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,040
check so how do we check

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,240
we can for example like a

97
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,880
b b c

98
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,199
b b a okay so we can check this

99
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,600
character if it's the same as this

100
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,240
if it is the same and i move it to b to

101
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,000
b

102
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,280
so i have two things one here left

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,160
one here right

104
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,400
got it so if it's the same i move it

105
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,520
towards each other the left plus

106
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,240
equals one yeah and left

107
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,880
right minus equals one until they meet

108
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,840
they're gonna

109
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:05,199
understand that then yeah yeah yeah okay

110
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,840
okay so how do we write this look look

111
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:12,160
left equals zero

112
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,039
right equals length

113
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,960
s minus one yeah because it's uh the

114
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,600
star always in computer always start

115
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,240
with zero

116
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,880
still means the first character okay yes

117
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,080
so we can

118
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,919
check this y left

119
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,400
smaller than right yeah when they don't

120
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:33,039
meet each other right

121
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:38,400
i'm right so we can check if

122
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:40,880
s left not equal

123
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,880
as y

124
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:52,240
not equal this is not equal equal

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,840
not equal

126
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,680
yeah yeah but how do you put it in

127
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,600
computer we use this to

128
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
to put it in computer not equal don't

129
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
get it okay because

130
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,639
we don't have these in computer keyboard

131
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,639
okay so this

132
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,639
yeah yeah come here look if if the left

133
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,560
try

134
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,000
that character is not equal to right

135
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
character what what should we do it's

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
not apparently

137
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,039
right then we turn fast right

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,080
we can fall no no no

139
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:27,840
no because then we need to move the

140
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,840
left to the right and move to the right

141
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,560
to the left right and then if they meet

142
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,639
in the meter that means that

143
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
minus equal plus equals the left would

144
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,240
be increment by one

145
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,680
right would be decrement by one okay

146
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,280
then in after this

147
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,880
what what should we do if they meet in

148
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,639
the middle also we don't

149
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,319
return true right because we find we

150
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,360
found this

151
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,479
i'm right so what yeah so so look

152
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,039
this race car can we do it with the race

153
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,560
car thing

154
00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:00,720
yeah like that race car

155
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,720
okay so left left is here

156
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,560
right is here

157
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,319
why left smaller than right is here

158
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,360
we're here yeah right here

159
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,960
if x left equals not if i

160
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,840
was r yes yeah so left would be

161
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,560
a i'll be a and then check if the same

162
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,440
yes

163
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,800
the same yes okay in the middle they are

164
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,919
in the middle so we don't check so

165
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,880
return true

166
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,319
okay to get it moving moving towards the

167
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,360
middle

168
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,800
yes okay so this is one way of doing and

169
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,840
we can also use the four

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,039
how do we use the four look we can use

171
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,280
the four

172
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:47,440
it's quite similar look for

173
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,440
i in range

174
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,000
land as rightly this will give the

175
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
number

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,759
index actually we don't need to check in

177
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,080
the meter right

178
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,199
because we only want we don't we don't

179
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,039
need to go

180
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,879
too late entire we need to go to the

181
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,599
meter so range this will be divided by 2

182
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,400
in a meter just in the middle so how do

183
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,039
we do

184
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:16,720
when we do this if s i

185
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:20,400
what's the corresponding if i is here

186
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:24,240
i is zero then we want to

187
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,520
find these corresponding so it will be s

188
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,639
lan s minus one minus i

189
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,159
right if i is zero then you'll be less s

190
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,880
minus one i zero i is one you'll be less

191
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,240
s minus one minus one minus two if it's

192
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,839
not equal

193
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,839
then return first

194
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,080
otherwise here return true okay it's the

195
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,240
similar

196
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,480
thing but we are doing a different

197
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,240
implementation so do you understand it

198
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,000
sorry we don't need airs because look

199
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,360
this is inside the floor right this is

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,519
in inside the floor

201
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,480
if we return then it will return it

202
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,720
doesn't go

203
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,920
it doesn't continue then at least we and

204
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,959
now we'll return to

205
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,560
after this for loop to get it we got a

206
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,800
space here yeah intent

207
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,000
like that that return is belongs to this

208
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,480
if

209
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,360
okay so this is one way of doing can we

210
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,399
do

211
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,080
can we use something like stack remember

212
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,080
do you remember the stack first thing

213
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,240
okay so how do we do it with the stack

214
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,360
that's the last approach and then you'll

215
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,839
tell me which one is the best okay

216
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,279
and today you're going to implement one

217
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,920
okay because i have it i've

218
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,160
i've told you now three approach right

219
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,519
three or four i can't remember you can

220
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,519
you can remember yeah now how do we do

221
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,279
it with the stack

222
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,000
first in our stack so first of all we

223
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,360
need to convert

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,360
this as string in string into a list

225
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,120
of finger space now there's no space you

226
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,079
you don't have the

227
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,760
space look we convert it into a list so

228
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,279
we use the list

229
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,800
as now it will be this will become a i

230
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,160
will become what

231
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:16,160
a b c

232
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,279
right okay so now

233
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,800
now we got these so what do we do what

234
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,680
do we do

235
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,680
how do we check

236
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,519
so we want to check if it's backwards

237
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,720
right it's backwards

238
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,680
it's backwards version is the same as

239
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,079
this

240
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,480
so column so what can we do

241
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,839
they are away array already just

242
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,800
standard

243
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,440
so what can we do with it so we need we

244
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,959
have this

245
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,720
then we have i we can say um

246
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,720
away just wait

247
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:02,880
for wait for i

248
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,880
in f so we're iterating from this a b

249
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,120
c right and now we need to take the

250
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:12,320
element from the aar

251
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,320
a r dot pop wow

252
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,360
what yes what do you want

253
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,880
i told you don't worry i i'll come back

254
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,880
to you later okay

255
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,040
remember yeah you'll be good boy on the

256
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,120
video okay remember

257
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,480
now we take the last element at the end

258
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,800
right we take

259
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,680
the last element at the end and we need

260
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,600
to check if

261
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,800
x if we not equals to i

262
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,720
then return first i

263
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,839
explained to you later okay otherwise

264
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
here we will return to

265
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,160
so to get it look we converted this

266
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,800
string into a b

267
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,000
c the list and every time we take an

268
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,240
element from the end

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,320
and pop it which is c and we compare to

270
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,160
the a if it's

271
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
if it's not equal then we'll do 10 4

272
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,440
immediately and

273
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,120
this way look if you race car race car

274
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,959
yeah then race car will be become a

275
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,079
a list and i take the c first

276
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,639
uh let's cut r here right and then

277
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,079
it's the same i could continue pop it

278
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,920
poppy poppy poppy poppy pop

279
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,240
and here if it's n and return so do you

280
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,240
get it

281
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,399
okay so which way do you like the best

282
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,600
but the most easy way would be is

283
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,000
pairing drum

284
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:37,360
s remember this

285
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,720
is s yeah you just need one

286
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,760
return yeah return is

287
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,959
we can leave this is the easiest way you

288
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,120
just only write that

289
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,440
yeah we turn left you find you know yeah

290
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,440
yeah

291
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,399
that returned that remember previously i

292
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,600
told you this is in a separate function

293
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,040
with red right

294
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,959
but you don't need to define two

295
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,519
functions you can just put it

296
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,639
there at least it's one way remember we

297
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,720
use the four

298
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,240
we use the two pointers left and right

299
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,200
right left and right and

300
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,040
put it in the middle right and we also

301
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,639
don't need to check the entire string we

302
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
just need to check half of the string

303
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,959
and calculate

304
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,120
the index okay so any questions

305
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,200
before you pick up one of your best

306
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,600
approach you know you like your favorite

307
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,079
approach to implement on your computer

308
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,160
and one final last thing say goodbye to

309
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:35,600
the video

310
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:38,880
say bye to the video

311
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,880
you know
