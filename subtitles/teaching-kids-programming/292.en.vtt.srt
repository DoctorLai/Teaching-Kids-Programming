1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,110

okay so today this is uh we're going to

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
okay so today this is uh we're going to
 

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,910
okay so today this is uh we're going to
talk about this consecutive duplicate so

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:09,920
talk about this consecutive duplicate so
 

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,910
talk about this consecutive duplicate so
can you read this the given string

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
can you read this the given string
 

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,230
can you read this the given string
consistent of x and y's to be the

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
consistent of x and y's to be the
 

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,070
consistent of x and y's to be the
minimum number of characters such as

10
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
minimum number of characters such as
 

11
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,670
minimum number of characters such as
there's no consecutive x and no

12
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
there's no consecutive x and no
 

13
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,269
there's no consecutive x and no
chemistry y okay

14
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
chemistry y okay
 

15
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,710
chemistry y okay
so look at this example like y y y x y y

16
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
so look at this example like y y y x y y
 

17
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,750
so look at this example like y y y x y y
x x so so basically look at the string

18
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
x x so so basically look at the string
 

19
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,750
x x so so basically look at the string
basically we want to remove the

20
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
basically we want to remove the
 

21
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,669
basically we want to remove the
duplicate right now we only keep one in

22
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
duplicate right now we only keep one in
 

23
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,029
duplicate right now we only keep one in
each group right

24
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
each group right
 

25
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,709
each group right
yeah

26
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
yeah
 

27
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,990
yeah
yeah make sense x y x yeah

28
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
yeah make sense x y x yeah
 

29
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,430
yeah make sense x y x yeah
so how about if i give you another

30
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
so how about if i give you another
 

31
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,470
so how about if i give you another
example like x x y y can you tell me

32
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
example like x x y y can you tell me
 

33
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,869
example like x x y y can you tell me
what should the output be

34
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
what should the output be
 

35
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,990
what should the output be
what's the output for it for this one y

36
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
what's the output for it for this one y
 

37
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,590
what's the output for it for this one y
x y x

38
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
x y x
 

39
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,189
x y x
x y x y yeah and how about another one

40
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
x y x y yeah and how about another one
 

41
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,630
x y x y yeah and how about another one
okay y y uh x x

42
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
okay y y uh x x
 

43
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,990
okay y y uh x x
y x

44
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
y x
 

45
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,549
y x
can you say one for forever please okay

46
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559

 

47
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,430

okay

48
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440

 

49
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,390

x

50
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
x
 

51
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,509
x
y x

52
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
y x
 

53
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,990
y x
okay all right okay

54
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
okay all right okay
 

55
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,950
okay all right okay
okay

56
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
okay
 

57
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,310
okay
okay let's see

58
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,320
okay let's see
 

59
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,429
okay let's see
so what uh one solution can you think of

60
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
so what uh one solution can you think of
 

61
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,070
so what uh one solution can you think of
any solutions like uh how can we how can

62
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
any solutions like uh how can we how can
 

63
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,469
any solutions like uh how can we how can
we implement this how can we

64
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
we implement this how can we
 

65
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,670
we implement this how can we
how can we do this

66
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680

 

67
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,670

look there are only two characters yeah

68
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
look there are only two characters yeah
 

69
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,390
look there are only two characters yeah
x and y yeah yeah so we can repeatedly

70
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
x and y yeah yeah so we can repeatedly
 

71
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,670
x and y yeah yeah so we can repeatedly
replace x to y x x to x and y

72
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
replace x to y x x to x and y
 

73
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,510
replace x to y x x to x and y
and y to

74
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,520
and y to
 

75
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,149
and y to
to yeah we can replace x x to y to y

76
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
to yeah we can replace x x to y to y
 

77
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,830
to yeah we can replace x x to y to y
to x yeah and y to walk

78
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
to x yeah and y to walk
 

79
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,950
to x yeah and y to walk
yeah

80
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
yeah
 

81
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,149
yeah
okay

82
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
okay
 

83
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,870
okay
yeah question please

84
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
yeah question please
 

85
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,710
yeah question please
okay okay let's turn it look

86
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
okay okay let's turn it look
 

87
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,510
okay okay let's turn it look
so we can do this while while why is

88
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
so we can do this while while why is
 

89
00:01:51,520 --> 00:02:06,789
so we can do this while while why is
something happening

90
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799

 

91
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,869

and then same for yy in x

92
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
and then same for yy in x
 

93
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,910
and then same for yy in x
x equals x dot replace what

94
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
x equals x dot replace what
 

95
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,790
x equals x dot replace what
can you

96
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
can you
 

97
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,750
can you
guess

98
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
guess
 

99
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,229
guess
replace two parameters the o string and

100
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
replace two parameters the o string and
 

101
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,830
replace two parameters the o string and
a new string so all string will be

102
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840
a new string so all string will be
 

103
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,430
a new string so all string will be
x when y yy when we found y y in x so we

104
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
x when y yy when we found y y in x so we
 

105
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,350
x when y yy when we found y y in x so we
want to replace two yy with a single one

106
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
want to replace two yy with a single one
 

107
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,350
want to replace two yy with a single one
x and y

108
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
x and y
 

109
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,630
x and y
now y y yeah so y replace two y y with a

110
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
now y y yeah so y replace two y y with a
 

111
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:45,110
now y y yeah so y replace two y y with a
single

112
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120

 

113
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,750

let's run first look we can see it looks

114
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
let's run first look we can see it looks
 

115
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,240
let's run first look we can see it looks
accepted a result and

116
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,250

 

117
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:58,149

[Music]

118
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159

 

119
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,949

but the thing is that this question uh

120
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
but the thing is that this question uh
 

121
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,830
but the thing is that this question uh
can you listen to me

122
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840
can you listen to me
 

123
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,309
can you listen to me
yes so this this only works when the

124
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
yes so this this only works when the
 

125
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,229
yes so this this only works when the
string consists of x and y it doesn't

126
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
string consists of x and y it doesn't
 

127
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,149
string consists of x and y it doesn't
work if you have some other characters

128
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
work if you have some other characters
 

129
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,270
work if you have some other characters
like abc right so and another con

130
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
like abc right so and another con
 

131
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,110
like abc right so and another con
another disadvantage of this approach is

132
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
another disadvantage of this approach is
 

133
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,190
another disadvantage of this approach is
that you're looking when we found the

134
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
that you're looking when we found the
 

135
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,670
that you're looking when we found the
substring in the s it took our n time

136
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
substring in the s it took our n time
 

137
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,390
substring in the s it took our n time
right so we will need we we need to find

138
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
right so we will need we we need to find
 

139
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,110
right so we will need we we need to find
if a substring is in s normally or in

140
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
if a substring is in s normally or in
 

141
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,470
if a substring is in s normally or in
time and then

142
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
time and then
 

143
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,149
time and then
and what and

144
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
and what and
 

145
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,470
and what and
then we need to replace it so in worst

146
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
then we need to replace it so in worst
 

147
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,430
then we need to replace it so in worst
case this will take all n square cubic

148
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
case this will take all n square cubic
 

149
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,670
case this will take all n square cubic
oven square and how it will be

150
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
oven square and how it will be
 

151
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,390
oven square and how it will be
first okay okay so i never explain it

152
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
first okay okay so i never explain it
 

153
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,110
first okay okay so i never explain it
now let's say this is always

154
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
now let's say this is always
 

155
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,030
now let's say this is always
let's put a comment and then let's do

156
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
let's put a comment and then let's do
 

157
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,550
let's put a comment and then let's do
this

158
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
this
 

159
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,670
this
okay so this is the first approach so we

160
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
okay so this is the first approach so we
 

161
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,670
okay so this is the first approach so we
can also we can check if the previous

162
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
can also we can check if the previous
 

163
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,910
can also we can check if the previous
character so for example like look is x

164
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
character so for example like look is x
 

165
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,550
character so for example like look is x
x y to y y okay so we go through each

166
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
x y to y y okay so we go through each
 

167
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,350
x y to y y okay so we go through each
character so if x will keep it right the

168
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
character so if x will keep it right the
 

169
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,910
character so if x will keep it right the
second x we skip it right because it

170
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
second x we skip it right because it
 

171
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,030
second x we skip it right because it
equals the previous one and the third

172
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
equals the previous one and the third
 

173
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,869
equals the previous one and the third
third character we skip it right i'm

174
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
third character we skip it right i'm
 

175
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,750
third character we skip it right i'm
right

176
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
right
 

177
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,670
right
does it make sense and then why should

178
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
does it make sense and then why should
 

179
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,589
does it make sense and then why should
we kick it hit it and the second one

180
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
we kick it hit it and the second one
 

181
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,030
we kick it hit it and the second one
should we keep it

182
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
should we keep it
 

183
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,869
should we keep it
okay so then based on this we can do

184
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
okay so then based on this we can do
 

185
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,710
okay so then based on this we can do
this so first of all we can put the

186
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
this so first of all we can put the
 

187
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,629
this so first of all we can put the
answer into a list yeah we keep the

188
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
answer into a list yeah we keep the
 

189
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,430
answer into a list yeah we keep the
answer

190
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
answer
 

191
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,030
answer
and then for

192
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
and then for
 

193
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,230
and then for
i let's say for c in s because of each

194
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
i let's say for c in s because of each
 

195
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,550
i let's say for c in s because of each
character if if they are nothing if it's

196
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
character if if they are nothing if it's
 

197
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,030
character if if they are nothing if it's
the first character yeah or

198
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
the first character yeah or
 

199
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,790
the first character yeah or
or if the

200
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
or if the
 

201
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,990
or if the
character

202
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
character
 

203
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,310
character
is not equal to what the previous

204
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
is not equal to what the previous
 

205
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,350
is not equal to what the previous
character how do we

206
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
character how do we
 

207
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,150
character how do we
what

208
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
what
 

209
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,150
what
would the previous character

210
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
would the previous character
 

211
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,710
would the previous character
in answer so this answer what minus one

212
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
in answer so this answer what minus one
 

213
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,790
in answer so this answer what minus one
right i know what what do we need to do

214
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
right i know what what do we need to do
 

215
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,550
right i know what what do we need to do
answer the opponent

216
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
answer the opponent
 

217
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,590
answer the opponent
okay what c right this is the third

218
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
okay what c right this is the third
 

219
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,070
okay what c right this is the third
and now what should we do we join we

220
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
and now what should we do we join we
 

221
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,950
and now what should we do we join we
should join the answer here

222
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
should join the answer here
 

223
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,350
should join the answer here
let's try this uh to see if well let's

224
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
let's try this uh to see if well let's
 

225
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,870
let's try this uh to see if well let's
run it okay

226
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
run it okay
 

227
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,350
run it okay
is it it works yeah okay

228
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
is it it works yeah okay
 

229
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,790
is it it works yeah okay
look if we point the answer at this

230
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
look if we point the answer at this
 

231
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,390
look if we point the answer at this
point it's a list here

232
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
point it's a list here
 

233
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,469
point it's a list here
if we put the answer and now we can see

234
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
if we put the answer and now we can see
 

235
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,670
if we put the answer and now we can see
if we run it look you see this

236
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
if we run it look you see this
 

237
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,110
if we run it look you see this
you're printed y x y x this is a list

238
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
you're printed y x y x this is a list
 

239
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,629
you're printed y x y x this is a list
and we need to join remember with the

240
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
and we need to join remember with the
 

241
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,870
and we need to join remember with the
joint putting this in the string so we

242
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
joint putting this in the string so we
 

243
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,670
joint putting this in the string so we
run it it works right

244
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680

 

245
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,670

a little bit slower but okay yeah so but

246
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
a little bit slower but okay yeah so but
 

247
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,290
a little bit slower but okay yeah so but
in in series this is all in time

248
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:27,300
in in series this is all in time
 

249
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,390
in in series this is all in time

253
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,029
time right all in time
does it make sense

254
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039

 

255
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,550

259
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,590

so it's always very the performance is

260
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
so it's always very the performance is
 

261
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,189
so it's always very the performance is
very but the most important thing is we

262
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
very but the most important thing is we
 

263
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,950
very but the most important thing is we
keep the results in the answer and go

264
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
keep the results in the answer and go
 

265
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,270
keep the results in the answer and go
through each character in the s

266
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
through each character in the s
 

267
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,430
through each character in the s
is then answer equal zero what does it

268
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
is then answer equal zero what does it
 

269
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,029
is then answer equal zero what does it
mean it means that

270
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
mean it means that
 

271
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,950
mean it means that
this is the first character we need to

272
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
this is the first character we need to
 

273
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,629
this is the first character we need to
put yeah

274
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
put yeah
 

275
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,670
put yeah
or

276
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
or
 

277
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,309
or
or if the current character is not equal

278
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
or if the current character is not equal
 

279
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,550
or if the current character is not equal
to the last character we have right it

280
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
to the last character we have right it
 

281
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,150
to the last character we have right it
means that because if it's equal it

282
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
means that because if it's equal it
 

283
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,150
means that because if it's equal it
means there's a consecutive characters

284
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
means there's a consecutive characters
 

285
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,550
means there's a consecutive characters
right now we append this character into

286
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
right now we append this character into
 

287
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,189
right now we append this character into
the answer right okay

288
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
the answer right okay
 

289
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,350
the answer right okay
okay and do you still remember the group

290
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
okay and do you still remember the group
 

291
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,510
okay and do you still remember the group
by function we talked about a few while

292
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
by function we talked about a few while
 

293
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,510
by function we talked about a few while
ago group by

294
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
ago group by
 

295
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,270
ago group by
we can use the google function as well

296
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
we can use the google function as well
 

297
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,749
we can use the google function as well
so how do we use it so look we can say

298
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
so how do we use it so look we can say
 

299
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,950
so how do we use it so look we can say
okay

300
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
okay
 

301
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,390
okay
okay let's say array equals

302
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
okay let's say array equals
 

303
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,990
okay let's say array equals
what x

304
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
what x
 

305
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,710
what x
for x

306
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720

 

307
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,469

grew by or maybe x y let's say x y in

308
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
grew by or maybe x y let's say x y in
 

309
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,070
grew by or maybe x y let's say x y in
it uh i think it's in eta all right

310
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080

 

311
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,110

all right

312
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120

 

313
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,749

maybe either two or stop goodbye

314
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
maybe either two or stop goodbye
 

315
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,029
maybe either two or stop goodbye
i'll show you

316
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
i'll show you
 

317
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,070
i'll show you
let's put

318
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
let's put
 

319
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,830
let's put
it up

320
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
it up
 

321
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,629
it up
okay

322
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
okay
 

323
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,469
okay
let's print this first first to see if

324
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
let's print this first first to see if
 

325
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,830
let's print this first first to see if
it works okay

326
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840

 

327
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,270

yeah because i haven't returned anything

328
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
yeah because i haven't returned anything
 

329
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,110
yeah because i haven't returned anything
look you pretend you put your results

330
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
look you pretend you put your results
 

331
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,550
look you pretend you put your results
now look at 20 y x y x right so now a r

332
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
now look at 20 y x y x right so now a r
 

333
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,350
now look at 20 y x y x right so now a r
look if i print it if if i print it uh

334
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
look if i print it if if i print it uh
 

335
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,950
look if i print it if if i print it uh
let's print it this one if i print it

336
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
let's print it this one if i print it
 

337
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,230
let's print it this one if i print it
quickly x

338
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
quickly x
 

339
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,790
quickly x
x and y as a two part right you know eta

340
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
x and y as a two part right you know eta
 

341
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,710
x and y as a two part right you know eta
two or group by and you see

342
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
two or group by and you see
 

343
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,309
two or group by and you see
what is it written

344
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319

 

345
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,550

yeah i haven't changed anything look why

346
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
yeah i haven't changed anything look why
 

347
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,670
yeah i haven't changed anything look why
is the unique key and then this iterator

348
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
is the unique key and then this iterator
 

349
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,150
is the unique key and then this iterator
this is actually iterator to the group

350
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
this is actually iterator to the group
 

351
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,469
this is actually iterator to the group
okay so why are you doing wrong

352
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
okay so why are you doing wrong
 

353
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,870
okay so why are you doing wrong
so we can put a list here we are placed

354
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
so we can put a list here we are placed
 

355
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,830
so we can put a list here we are placed
here to see why what it is okay

356
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
here to see why what it is okay
 

357
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,830
here to see why what it is okay
look what

358
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
look what
 

359
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,710
look what
can you look at look this is y so the

360
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
can you look at look this is y so the
 

361
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,550
can you look at look this is y so the
result the input is yyyy xyx

362
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
result the input is yyyy xyx
 

363
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,029
result the input is yyyy xyx
and now we grouping look we use the x y

364
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
and now we grouping look we use the x y
 

365
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,510
and now we grouping look we use the x y
in eta to us go by s now when this

366
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
in eta to us go by s now when this
 

367
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,029
in eta to us go by s now when this
happens it has

368
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
happens it has
 

369
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,189
happens it has
it has two x axis is the key so it means

370
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
it has two x axis is the key so it means
 

371
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,350
it has two x axis is the key so it means
y and then it points to yy or x points

372
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
y and then it points to yy or x points
 

373
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,469
y and then it points to yy or x points
to each group right look y

374
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:58,479
to each group right look y
 

375
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,350
to each group right look y
and it has the group and x it has two so

376
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
and it has the group and x it has two so
 

377
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,309
and it has the group and x it has two so
look so we only need to return the first

378
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
look so we only need to return the first
 

379
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,710
look so we only need to return the first
one which is x is the key

380
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
one which is x is the key
 

381
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,270
one which is x is the key
we only need that one and then we we can

382
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
we only need that one and then we we can
 

383
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,629
we only need that one and then we we can
we can do what

384
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
we can do what
 

385
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:24,830
we can do what
the same

386
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840

 

387
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,749

uh remove the second one right join yeah

388
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
uh remove the second one right join yeah
 

389
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,830
uh remove the second one right join yeah
we can remove this

390
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
we can remove this
 

391
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,310
we can remove this
and that will be a one-niner right

392
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
and that will be a one-niner right
 

393
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,269
and that will be a one-niner right
repeat the one okay so you see

394
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
repeat the one okay so you see
 

395
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,190
repeat the one okay so you see
six milliseconds and so this time

396
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
six milliseconds and so this time
 

397
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,990
six milliseconds and so this time
complexity is

398
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
complexity is
 

399
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,110
complexity is
space space is a one as well space is

400
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
space space is a one as well space is
 

401
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,949
space space is a one as well space is
the one but this one stays what's the

402
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
the one but this one stays what's the
 

403
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,550
the one but this one stays what's the
space let's follow the second approach

404
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
space let's follow the second approach
 

405
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,070
space let's follow the second approach
what's the space

406
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
what's the space
 

407
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,470
what's the space
for this one do we use any space in this

408
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
for this one do we use any space in this
 

409
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,470
for this one do we use any space in this
music

410
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
music
 

411
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:04,150
music
no

412
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160

 

413
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,470

but we are modifying the original string

414
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
but we are modifying the original string
 

415
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,870
but we are modifying the original string
because we are replacing this

416
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
because we are replacing this
 

417
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,350
because we are replacing this
substring this is the replacement 24

418
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
substring this is the replacement 24
 

419
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,829
substring this is the replacement 24

talking okay so look
 

425
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,870
talking okay so look
oh string this what's the place what's

426
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
oh string this what's the place what's
 

427
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,590
oh string this what's the place what's
the first parameter of the place

428
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
the first parameter of the place
 

429
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,230
the first parameter of the place
x o string and that's the new string to

430
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
x o string and that's the new string to
 

431
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,430
x o string and that's the new string to
replace okay

432

daddy dad

466
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
daddy dad
 

467
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,870
daddy dad
let's do it let's let's let's run this

468
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
let's do it let's let's let's run this
 

469
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,230
let's do it let's let's let's run this
to see that mom okay because i i said i

470
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
to see that mom okay because i i said i
 

471
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,150
to see that mom okay because i i said i
want to replace eric here in the

472
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
want to replace eric here in the
 

473
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,069
want to replace eric here in the
original screen with daddy and then i

474
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:10,079
original screen with daddy and then i
 

475
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,630
original screen with daddy and then i
want to replace ryan with mommy okay

476
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
want to replace ryan with mommy okay
 

477
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,550
want to replace ryan with mommy okay
that's why it is here so look i want to

478
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
that's why it is here so look i want to
 

479
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,030
that's why it is here so look i want to
replace xx with x and then i want to

480
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
replace xx with x and then i want to
 

481
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,110
replace xx with x and then i want to
keep doing this when we find the x axis

482
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
keep doing this when we find the x axis
 

483
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,430
keep doing this when we find the x axis
i'll keep doing this when we find y to

484
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
i'll keep doing this when we find y to
 

485
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,750
i'll keep doing this when we find y to
replace y with y right that's what it is

486
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
replace y with y right that's what it is
 

487
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,790
replace y with y right that's what it is
okay and the second approach yeah we go

488
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
okay and the second approach yeah we go
 

489
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,590
okay and the second approach yeah we go
through each character yx as long as

490
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
through each character yx as long as
 

491
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,190
through each character yx as long as
it's not equal to the previous one we

492
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
it's not equal to the previous one we
 

493
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,269
it's not equal to the previous one we
push it to the desired

494
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
push it to the desired
 

495
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,990
push it to the desired
array this then we later we join it and
