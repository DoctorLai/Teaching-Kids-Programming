00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,309
go hello hello miss area
yeah okay so today's class is a bit

4
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
yeah okay so today's class is a bit
 

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,510
yeah okay so today's class is a bit
simple okay i

6
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
simple okay i

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,790
i believe you can do it okay so given a
string a

10
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
string a

e e f i want you to tell me what's the
 

15
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,510
e e f i want you to tell me what's the
first

16
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
first
 

17
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,710
first
unique characters first unit a

18
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
unique characters first unit a

b c d e f
 

21
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,070
b c d e f
what which one is the first unique

22
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
what which one is the first unique
 

23
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,470
what which one is the first unique
character a

24
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,480
character a
 

25
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,430
character a
is a

26
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:36,440

 

27
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,350

[Music]

28
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360

 

29
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,229

a appears twice b appears twice c appear

30
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
a appears twice b appears twice c appear
 

31
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,510
a appears twice b appears twice c appear
once yes

32
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
once yes
 

33
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,990
once yes
d appear once e appeared twice f

34
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
d appear once e appeared twice f
 

35
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,110
d appear once e appeared twice f
appeared once so

36
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
appeared once so
 

37
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,430
appeared once so
the first unit could be c because it

38
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
the first unit could be c because it
 

39
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,029
the first unit could be c because it
only appears one right

40
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
only appears one right
 

41
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,229
only appears one right
okay if if it's a a b

42
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
okay if if it's a a b
 

43
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,270
okay if if it's a a b
b there's no unique characters and

44
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
b there's no unique characters and
 

45
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,670
b there's no unique characters and
you need to tell me it's minus one if

46
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
you need to tell me it's minus one if
 

47
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,349
you need to tell me it's minus one if
it's uh look at this one you need to

48
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
it's uh look at this one you need to
 

49
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,950
it's uh look at this one you need to
tell me it's 0 1 2

50
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
tell me it's 0 1 2
 

51
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,070
tell me it's 0 1 2
3 4 index 4 yeah but the first character

52
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
3 4 index 4 yeah but the first character
 

53
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,270
3 4 index 4 yeah but the first character
in the x0

54
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
in the x0
 

55
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,429
in the x0
yeah it seems very simple simple

56
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
yeah it seems very simple simple
 

57
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,670
yeah it seems very simple simple
hey remember how can we solve this

58
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
hey remember how can we solve this
 

59
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,030
hey remember how can we solve this
um yeah how can we solve this

60
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
um yeah how can we solve this
 

61
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,550
um yeah how can we solve this
we all have the data structures that

62
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
we all have the data structures that
 

63
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,510
we all have the data structures that
we're going to use

64
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
we're going to use
 

65
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,030
we're going to use
why would you listen to a point how are

66
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
why would you listen to a point how are
 

67
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,710
why would you listen to a point how are
we using the two points

68
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
we using the two points
 

69
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,749
we using the two points
um wait wait oh hold on

70
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
um wait wait oh hold on
 

71
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,820
um wait wait oh hold on
what's this yeah

72
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:37,830
what's this yeah
 

73
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,350
what's this yeah
[Music]

74
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
[Music]
 

75
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,069
[Music]
we have one point is a and you check

76
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
we have one point is a and you check
 

77
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,270
we have one point is a and you check
through the list

78
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
through the list
 

79
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,990
through the list
and see if there's another a i think i

80
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
and see if there's another a i think i
 

81
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,310
and see if there's another a i think i
think that's briefcasing

82
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
think that's briefcasing
 

83
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,910
think that's briefcasing
uh-huh okay so yeah this is if i'm at a

84
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
uh-huh okay so yeah this is if i'm at a
 

85
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,749
uh-huh okay so yeah this is if i'm at a
i want to check the rest if you say a

86
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
i want to check the rest if you say a
 

87
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,590
i want to check the rest if you say a
yeah yeah

88
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
yeah yeah
 

89
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,670
yeah yeah
if i'm b i want to check if they are

90
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
if i'm b i want to check if they are
 

91
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,990
if i'm b i want to check if they are
less they are b they have two b

92
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
less they are b they have two b
 

93
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,709
less they are b they have two b
so in this case you if there are n

94
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
so in this case you if there are n
 

95
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,990
so in this case you if there are n
characters

96
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
characters
 

97
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,030
characters
what's the time complexity and i think

98
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
what's the time complexity and i think
 

99
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,309
what's the time complexity and i think
it's

100
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
it's
 

101
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,350
it's
2 pi over 2 and square because for each

102
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
2 pi over 2 and square because for each
 

103
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,790
2 pi over 2 and square because for each
n you need to say for look for i

104
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
n you need to say for look for i
 

105
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,830
n you need to say for look for i
if n equals length of d let's say s

106
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
if n equals length of d let's say s
 

107
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,869
if n equals length of d let's say s
yeah s in range

108
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
yeah s in range
 

109
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,430
yeah s in range
n right and then i i need to do what for

110
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
n right and then i i need to do what for
 

111
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,270
n right and then i i need to do what for
j in range

112
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
j in range
 

113
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,110
j in range
another n as well if

114
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
another n as well if
 

115
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,550
another n as well if
look if i not equals

116
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
look if i not equals
 

117
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,110
look if i not equals
j if the index is known here j and

118
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120

 

119
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,150

and what s i not equal x

120
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
and what s i not equal x
 

121
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,589
and what s i not equal x
yeah equals x three right so let's say i

122
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
yeah equals x three right so let's say i
 

123
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,869
yeah equals x three right so let's say i
have a duplicate

124
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
have a duplicate
 

125
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,710
have a duplicate
uh i have this unique

126
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
uh i have this unique
 

127
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,509
uh i have this unique
unique equal at the beginning i set it

128
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
unique equal at the beginning i set it
 

129
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,070
unique equal at the beginning i set it
to true

130
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
to true
 

131
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,949
to true
and then here i set it to unique equal u

132
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
and then here i set it to unique equal u
 

133
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,670
and then here i set it to unique equal u
n i q

134
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
n i q
 

135
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,949
n i q
u e equals one fourth right and i found

136
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
u e equals one fourth right and i found
 

137
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,190
u e equals one fourth right and i found
this i need to break it

138
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
this i need to break it
 

139
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,710
this i need to break it
and then if i say if unique

140
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
and then if i say if unique
 

141
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,830
and then if i say if unique
if i say unique then what happen

142
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
if i say unique then what happen
 

143
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,070
if i say unique then what happen
i is the first index then i can just

144
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
i is the first index then i can just
 

145
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,949
i is the first index then i can just
return

146
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
return
 

147
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,390

and what should i do if i integrate with
 

167
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,110
and what should i do if i integrate with
j i know

168
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120

 

169
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,110

why because we found it unique yeah

170
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
why because we found it unique yeah
 

171
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,990
why because we found it unique yeah
after all is if his unique is true

172
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
after all is if his unique is true
 

173
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,270
after all is if his unique is true
means that look here we see look at

174
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
means that look here we see look at
 

175
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,630
means that look here we see look at
i even see there's no such index that

176
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
i even see there's no such index that
 

177
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,750
i even see there's no such index that
other than this index which is

178
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
other than this index which is
 

179
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,630
other than this index which is
has the same character c then this unit

180
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
has the same character c then this unit
 

181
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,190
has the same character c then this unit
would be

182
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
would be
 

183
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,110
would be
true right and then if i release then i

184
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
true right and then if i release then i
 

185
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,309
true right and then if i release then i
will return

186
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
will return
 

187
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,630
will return
which value i oj i think that's okay

188
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
which value i oj i think that's okay
 

189
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,270
which value i oj i think that's okay
i all right come on and then we ten

190
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
i all right come on and then we ten
 

191
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,189
i all right come on and then we ten
minus one here

192
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
minus one here
 

193
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,949
minus one here
what's the time complexity all in square

194
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
what's the time complexity all in square
 

195
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,390
what's the time complexity all in square
because here with your end and you're

196
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
because here with your end and you're
 

197
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,950
because here with your end and you're
another

198
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
another
 

199
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,469
another
yeah can we optimize it to our end using

200
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
yeah can we optimize it to our end using
 

201
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,830
yeah can we optimize it to our end using
kind of bigger structure

202
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
kind of bigger structure
 

203
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,870
kind of bigger structure
remember this is quite okay yeah

204
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
remember this is quite okay yeah
 

205
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,469
remember this is quite okay yeah
notebook

206
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
notebook
 

207
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,590
notebook
knew it so we first go through the

208
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
knew it so we first go through the
 

209
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,550
knew it so we first go through the
array uh to find to count how many

210
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
array uh to find to count how many
 

211
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,350

characters

212
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
characters
 

213
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,710
characters
how many how many times that

214
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
how many how many times that
 

215
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,110
how many how many times that
each character appears in an array right

216
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
each character appears in an array right
 

217
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,909
each character appears in an array right
yeah

218
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
yeah
 

219
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,189

okay so look
 

221
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,950
okay so look
oh if we wrote that out that's a cop

222
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
oh if we wrote that out that's a cop
 

223
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,990
oh if we wrote that out that's a cop
c equals

224
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
c equals
 

225
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,430
c equals
what kind of default dictionary

226
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
what kind of default dictionary
 

227
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,029
what kind of default dictionary
dictionary dot com defaultionally and

c i c is the dictionary and then c i
i is the letter and i want to count how

238
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
i is the letter and i want to count how
 

239
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,070
i is the letter and i want to count how
many of them so what do i need to do

240
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
many of them so what do i need to do
 

241

how many times i now
 

247
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,790
how many times i now
one yeah okay then look for

248
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
one yeah okay then look for
 

249
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,830
one yeah okay then look for
i look remember for i j

i look remember for i j
 

251
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,749
i look remember for i j
in immune can you tell me what's

252
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
in immune can you tell me what's
 

253
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,390
in immune can you tell me what's
immunity we'll talk about this

254
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
immunity we'll talk about this
 

255
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,150
immunity we'll talk about this
again yeah look s is this yeah

256
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
again yeah look s is this yeah
 

257
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,189
again yeah look s is this yeah
s is this enumerate just make it what a

258
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
s is this enumerate just make it what a
 

259
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,469
s is this enumerate just make it what a
tuper

260
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
tuper
 

261
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,150
tuper
look this is a b b a c

262
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
look this is a b b a c
 

263
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,430
look this is a b b a c
d e e f alright look okay

264
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
d e e f alright look okay
 

265
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,710
d e e f alright look okay
this is s right this is the s yeah right

266
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
this is s right this is the s yeah right
 

267
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,990
this is s right this is the s yeah right
if you say if you fall i

268
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
if you say if you fall i
 

269
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,430
if you say if you fall i
in s i will be a b b a like that right

270
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
in s i will be a b b a like that right
 

271
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,790
in s i will be a b b a like that right
you'll be iterating this

272
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
you'll be iterating this
 

273
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,830
you'll be iterating this
yeah okay yeah and if i put a

274
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
yeah okay yeah and if i put a
 

275
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,070
yeah okay yeah and if i put a
numerator what does it mean that'll be

276
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
numerator what does it mean that'll be
 

277
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,950
numerator what does it mean that'll be
the index

278
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
the index
 

279
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,390
the index
0 1 2 3 4 it would be two per

280
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
0 1 2 3 4 it would be two per
 

281
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,870
0 1 2 3 4 it would be two per
for each one right so i will be zero one

282
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
for each one right so i will be zero one
 

283
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,390
for each one right so i will be zero one
two three four five

284
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
two three four five
 

285
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,909
two three four five
and j will be one it's a pair

286
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
and j will be one it's a pair
 

287
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,110
and j will be one it's a pair
i will be zero please one two three

288
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
i will be zero please one two three
 

289
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,510
i will be zero please one two three
will be the other abc yeah this one so

290
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
will be the other abc yeah this one so
 

291
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,230
will be the other abc yeah this one so
okay look

292
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
okay look
 

293
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,430
okay look
if this look if one so what do we do

294
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
if this look if one so what do we do
 

295
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,749
if this look if one so what do we do
this

296
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
this
 

297
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,909
this
i is index j is the value so what do we

298
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
i is index j is the value so what do we
 

299
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,590
i is index j is the value so what do we
need to check here

300
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
need to check here
 

301
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,189

what's the time complexity a1 why is

430

what's the time complexity a1 why is
 

431
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,550
what's the time complexity a1 why is
lower

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560

 

433
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,550

because like wait does it catapult

434
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
because like wait does it catapult
 

435
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,829
because like wait does it catapult
catapult a and lowercase a count as

436
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
catapult a and lowercase a count as
 

437
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,630
catapult a and lowercase a count as
a new okay so if because look

438
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
a new okay so if because look
 

439
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,870
a new okay so if because look
space complexity yeah if we use the

440
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:34,880
space complexity yeah if we use the
 

441
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,670
space complexity yeah if we use the
counter

442
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680

443
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,590

if i don't tell you that the string

444
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:37,600
if i don't tell you that the string
 

445

if i don't tell you that the string
contains only uppercase or lowercase

contains only uppercase or lowercase
 

447
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,269

449
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,990

it could be any right yeah so the worst

450
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
it could be any right yeah so the worst
 

451
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,470
it could be any right yeah so the worst
case

452
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
case
 

453
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,590
case
is that in the worst case is that

454
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
is that in the worst case is that
 

455
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,030
is that in the worst case is that
the end the string contains n characters

456
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
the end the string contains n characters
 

457
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,230
the end the string contains n characters
they are all unique

458
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
they are all unique
 

459
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,670
they are all unique
right so you need a counter attachment

460
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
right so you need a counter attachment
 

461
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,269
right so you need a counter attachment
to store

462
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
to store
 

463
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,230
to store
to be able to store n characters right

464
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
to be able to store n characters right
 

465
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,790
to be able to store n characters right
yeah

466
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
yeah
 

467
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,550
yeah
that's in the worst case aware but if i

468
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
that's in the worst case aware but if i
 

469
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,190
that's in the worst case aware but if i
tell you that the

470
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
tell you that the
 

471
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,710
tell you that the
the characters they are only uh

472
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
the characters they are only uh
 

473
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,630
the characters they are only uh
the s only contains uppercase all

474
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
the s only contains uppercase all
 

475
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,230
the s only contains uppercase all
lowercase characters and what's the

476
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
lowercase characters and what's the
 

477
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,110
lowercase characters and what's the
maximum

478
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
maximum
 

479
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,430
maximum
possibility that the lowercase uppercase

480
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
possibility that the lowercase uppercase
 

481
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,829
possibility that the lowercase uppercase
how many uppercase characters or how

482
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
how many uppercase characters or how
 

483
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,190
how many uppercase characters or how
many lowercase

484
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
many lowercase
 

485
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,150
many lowercase
26. 26. so in the worst case what

486
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
26. 26. so in the worst case what
 

487
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,630
26. 26. so in the worst case what
happened

488
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
happened
 

489
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,269
happened
that we only need the hashmap contains

490
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
that we only need the hashmap contains
 

491
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,310
that we only need the hashmap contains
only 26

492

only 26
 

493
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,509
only 26
so to be able to stop 26 yeah because

494
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
so to be able to stop 26 yeah because
 

495
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,949
so to be able to stop 26 yeah because
abc we know it's already 26 so a and

496
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
abc we know it's already 26 so a and
 

497
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,870
abc we know it's already 26 so a and
look it's constant right because we

498
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:36,880
look it's constant right because we
 

499
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,949
look it's constant right because we
already know is 26.

500

already know is 26.
no matter how big is your n a minion

502
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
no matter how big is your n a minion
 

503
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,190
no matter how big is your n a minion
characters

504
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
characters
 

505
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,430
characters
yeah if there are minion characters but

506
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
yeah if there are minion characters but
 

507
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,750
yeah if there are minion characters but
if there are million characters and

508
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
if there are million characters and
 

509
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,350
if there are million characters and
characters only contains lowercase

510
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
characters only contains lowercase
 

511
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,910
characters only contains lowercase
characters how what how big of this

512
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
characters how what how big of this
 

513
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,790
characters how what how big of this
counter

514
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
counter
 

515
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,509
counter
do we need

516
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
do we need
 

517
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,670
do we need
how many how big is the counter we need

518
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
how many how big is the counter we need
 

519
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,670
how many how big is the counter we need
how big is the size of the counter

520
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
how big is the size of the counter
 

521
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,710
how big is the size of the counter
26 26 exactly because we just need a to

522
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
26 26 exactly because we just need a to
 

523
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,069
26 26 exactly because we just need a to
z to count how many

524
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
z to count how many
 

525
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,990
z to count how many
times does it make sense so in this case

526
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
times does it make sense so in this case
 

527
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,590
times does it make sense so in this case
it doesn't change

528
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
it doesn't change
 

529
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,590
it doesn't change
the the size of the space sudden change

530
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
the the size of the space sudden change
 

531
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,790
the the size of the space sudden change
doesn't grow doesn't

532
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
doesn't grow doesn't
 

533
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,870
doesn't grow doesn't
grow or doesn't shrink depending on

534
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
grow or doesn't shrink depending on
 

535
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,069
grow or doesn't shrink depending on
regardless of this size of s right so

536
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
regardless of this size of s right so
 

537
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:20,949
regardless of this size of s right so
it's constant

538
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
it's constant
 

539
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,030
it's constant
right but if i don't tell you it's

540
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
right but if i don't tell you it's
 

541
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,430
right but if i don't tell you it's
lowercase letter if a million characters

542
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
lowercase letter if a million characters
 

543
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,030
lowercase letter if a million characters
there could be a million different

544
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
there could be a million different
 

545
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,190
there could be a million different
characters unique characters right

546
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
characters unique characters right
 

547
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,389
characters unique characters right
so in the worst case the

548
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
so in the worst case the
 

549
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,110
so in the worst case the
the size of the space could be n right

550
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
the size of the space could be n right
 

551
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,110
the size of the space could be n right
correct that's the difference between y

552
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
correct that's the difference between y
 

553
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,310
correct that's the difference between y
y is one or one okay so look

554
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
y is one or one okay so look
 

555
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,269
y is one or one okay so look
if i tell you it's a lowercase character

556
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,279
if i tell you it's a lowercase character
 

557
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,870
if i tell you it's a lowercase character
so i don't need these right

558
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
so i don't need these right
 

559
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,069
so i don't need these right
i can just store this c equals

560
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
i can just store this c equals
 

561
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,110
i can just store this c equals
zero away times 26

562
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
zero away times 26
 

563
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,110
zero away times 26
right 26 and then i just need to do this

564
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
right 26 and then i just need to do this
 

565
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,389
right 26 and then i just need to do this
i just need to read four for

566
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
i just need to read four for
 

567
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,430
i just need to read four for
i in s c

568
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
i in s c
 

569
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,790
i in s c
i want to map remember if it's lowercase

570
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
i want to map remember if it's lowercase
 

571
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,710
i want to map remember if it's lowercase
what's a to ascii do you remember

572
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
what's a to ascii do you remember
 

573
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,269
what's a to ascii do you remember
what's the a to ascii the ascii code

574
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
what's the a to ascii the ascii code
 

575
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,110
what's the a to ascii the ascii code
a what was it again 96 97

576
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
a what was it again 96 97
 

577
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,629
a what was it again 96 97
yeah and i see seven you've got it right

578
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
yeah and i see seven you've got it right
 

579
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,269
yeah and i see seven you've got it right
okay so which function i need to convert

580
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
okay so which function i need to convert
 

581
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,550
okay so which function i need to convert
from a to

582
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
from a to
 

583
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,750
from a to
to 97. no

584
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
to 97. no
 

585
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,990
to 97. no
there are two of choice or d or chr

586
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000
there are two of choice or d or chr
 

587
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,990
there are two of choice or d or chr
which one

588
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
which one
 

589
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,430
which one
r d o r d with an i

590
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
r d o r d with an i
 

591
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,069
r d o r d with an i
right yeah this converts to 97 and i

592
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
right yeah this converts to 97 and i
 

593
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,389
right yeah this converts to 97 and i
need to minus 97 right

594
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
need to minus 97 right
 

595
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,189
need to minus 97 right
yeah plus equal what

596
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199

 

597
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,189

c is it's like a key value it's the same

598
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:47,199
c is it's like a key value it's the same
 

599
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,949
c is it's like a key value it's the same
yeah this is the key

600
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
yeah this is the key
 

601
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,150
yeah this is the key
except that this is a array with index

602
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
except that this is a array with index
 

603
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,750
except that this is a array with index
from 0 to 25

604
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
from 0 to 25
 

605
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,110
from 0 to 25
26 and a if a is 97 i minus 97 is zero

606
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
26 and a if a is 97 i minus 97 is zero
 

607
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,470
26 and a if a is 97 i minus 97 is zero
so it's like i have 26 buckets

608
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
so it's like i have 26 buckets
 

609
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,470
so it's like i have 26 buckets
and every time i meet the a i want to

610
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
and every time i meet the a i want to
 

611
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,230
and every time i meet the a i want to
increment

612
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
increment
 

613
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,389
increment
increment what's increment mean plus one

614
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
increment what's increment mean plus one
 

615
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,509
increment what's increment mean plus one
yeah plus one

616
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:09,519
yeah plus one
 

617
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,069
yeah plus one
okay and here look for either this is

618
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
okay and here look for either this is
 

619
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:12,870
okay and here look for either this is
the same yeah

620
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
the same yeah
 

621
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,230
the same yeah
no no no j j is the

622
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
no no no j j is the
 

623
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,590
no no no j j is the
j is the value right so what do i do

624
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
j is the value right so what do i do
 

625
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,670
j is the value right so what do i do
with the j

626
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
with the j
 

627
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,550
with the j
what should i do with the j yeah what

628
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
what should i do with the j yeah what
 

629
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,150
what should i do with the j yeah what
should i do

630

should i do
 

631
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,710
should i do
j is the value and i want to map it to

632
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
j is the value and i want to map it to
 

633
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,550
j is the value and i want to map it to
the index of the bucket

634
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
the index of the bucket
 

635
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,690
the index of the bucket
so what should i do

636
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:32,700
so what should i do
 

637
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:40,790

come on it's there ascii
 

645
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,189
come on it's there ascii
order j minus 97. yeah that's what i

646
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
order j minus 97. yeah that's what i

675
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,389
um do i need to do uni actually need to
know

676
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
know
 

677
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,550
know
minus ninety seven equals one how many

678
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
minus ninety seven equals one how many
 

679
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,590
minus ninety seven equals one how many
calculators are

680
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
calculators are
 

681
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,590
calculators are
six zero to twenty six or twenty five

682
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
six zero to twenty six or twenty five
 

683
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,749
six zero to twenty six or twenty five
twenty five twenty five

684
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
twenty five twenty five
 

685
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,870
twenty five twenty five
okay so this is mapping from 0 to 25 and

686
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
okay so this is mapping from 0 to 25 and
 

687
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,629
okay so this is mapping from 0 to 25 and
then here j is again

688
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
then here j is again
 

689
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,790
then here j is again
so mapping from 0 to 25 i want to check

690
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
so mapping from 0 to 25 i want to check
 

691
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,670
so mapping from 0 to 25 i want to check
the bucket

692
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
the bucket
 

693
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,550
the bucket
well basically there are 26 buckets if i

694
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
well basically there are 26 buckets if i
 

695
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,870
well basically there are 26 buckets if i
meet one a i plus 1 if i mean

696
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
meet one a i plus 1 if i mean
 

697
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,430
meet one a i plus 1 if i mean
b two then there'll be two here right so

698
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
b two then there'll be two here right so
 

699
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,790
b two then there'll be two here right so
i go through these

700
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
i go through these
 

701
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,350
i go through these
buckets and if it's one that's the first

702
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
buckets and if it's one that's the first
 

703
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,710
buckets and if it's one that's the first
unique character right

704
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
unique character right
 

705
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,710
unique character right

we want to enumerate a string

768
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
we want to enumerate a string
 

769
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,110
we want to enumerate a string
so which is the string what's the

770
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
so which is the string what's the
 

771
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:37,190
so which is the string what's the

you see

776
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
you see
 

777
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,950
you see
only one character with intended index

778
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
only one character with intended index
 

779
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,549

yeah yeah four in the loop yeah of
 

785
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,110
yeah yeah four in the loop yeah of
course yeah

786
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
course yeah
 

787
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,750
course yeah
so this is the loop we are looking now

788
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
so this is the loop we are looking now
 

789
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,350
so this is the loop we are looking now
we're looking for each loop

790
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
we're looking for each loop
 

791
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,710
we're looking for each loop
what we don't want to do we're going to

792
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
what we don't want to do we're going to
 

793
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,990
what we don't want to do we're going to
do is put it in the body

794
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
do is put it in the body
 

795
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,070
do is put it in the body
here so that's why we have a space there

796
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
here so that's why we have a space there
 

797
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,830
here so that's why we have a space there
if what

798
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
if what
 

799
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,630
if what
can we write it faster right if what

800
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:05,640
can we write it faster right if what
 

801
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,190
can we write it faster right if what
