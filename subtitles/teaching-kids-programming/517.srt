1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,839
hello mr mr ryan all right yeah okay so

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,400
you have given me this yeah a piece of

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,599
paper with six pokemons on it and you

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,120
write lots of the basic stats

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,440
yeah so

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,600
then i translate this to here right so

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,920
what's the advantage comparing to these

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,160
and then

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,359
what's their language

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,080
that one's more easier to understand

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,640
this is more easy

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,640
on there is

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
yes that's a good point yeah because

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,079
look for each one you have to

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,200
write the attributes right separate

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,520
right

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,760
the most important thing is that these

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,239
data are here and there it's not

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,920
organized this is organized we talk

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,000
about database last lesson right so

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,559
these are organized so

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,120
i put all the data in the table

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,120
in the table

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
okay yeah obviously we can extend the

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,840
columns these are the columns these are

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,759
the rows rows for each row

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,119
is a pokemon each column is an attribute

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,640
hit point attack defense spatial attack

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,600
special defense

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
speed

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,840
gender okay generally the data you give

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,960
me is a percentage so i 0.5 is 50

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,960
percent

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,600
one is 100 okay

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,520
and then also there's one is in it

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
yeah also there's a two term right i

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,159
didn't put total here because i think

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,759
it's uh the total value can be computed

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,640
here right for example like this one the

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,600
total is 720 this one

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,280
the last last one 720 is basically the

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,240
sum of these these

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,280
liquids right so there's no need to put

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,119
a

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,960
total here because if i change this

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,159
value i have to change the total right

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,960
so this total value can be derived from

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,160
those six columns so if i put a total

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,520
here let's call the redundancy data

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
redundancy

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,599
we asked computers to store the data in

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,040
such format in the organized way this is

53
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:20,160
also called relation database are the

54
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,160
relation database

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,280
are the um

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,680
as relation database management system

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,360
relational relational yeah so we can

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,280
have different tables for storing

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,599
different kinds of data

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,760
okay so look by this so can you tell me

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,959
which one has the most

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,800
fastest speed which character

63
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,640
so what are you looking at so which

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,160
column speed

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,080
is online so this one 110. if i only

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,040
give you this can you tell me which one

67
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,879
is the slowest speed

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,120
it's not easy to see right but here i

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,239
can only look at this color the slowly

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,200
this one

71
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,440
yeah

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,480
you see it but around here right this is

73
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,239
organized so if we ask computer to do

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,239
this we have this sql

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,959
structure query language structured

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,080
query

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,879
language

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,239
so if i ask computer

79
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,280
tell me the name okay specific the name

80
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,440
of the pokemon who has the strongest uh

81
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,879
speed uh the fatigue speed oh yes okay

82
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,879
so the computer could first of

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,080
okay okay so maybe i have raised my

84
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,840
question can you ask the computer to

85
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,400
solve the taper by

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,519
solid pokemon by the speed then we can

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,760
ask computer to do this select

88
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,680
okay see that see that we can see that's

89
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,680
something right oh here's another column

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,080
it's another name okay let's say it's

91
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
another name

92
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,760
comma

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
and speed

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,319
wrong

95
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,400
okay

96
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,720
this table okay let's say this type of

97
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,799
name is pokemon

98
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,799
pokemon okay pokemon

99
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,280
from somewhere from this table this is

100
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,079
called pokemon

101
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,040
okay

102
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,880
and then if i do this right the the

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,080
computer will just return

104
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,360
the name

105
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,560
and the sp you give us these two columns

106
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
right

107
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,440
and then i can say order

108
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,840
order by

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,520
sp

110
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,600
right all the biases then you would

111
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,040
rearrange the rows in such a way okay

112
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,720
the first one is 120 the second row is

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,720
90

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,479
80 75 60 50. okay all the by 54 is

115
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,000
ascending okay so we have to

116
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,120
specifically descending d esc okay and

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,960
we also we can say asc asc is ascending

118
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,520
desc descending

119
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,759
look this is one sql

120
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,479
slab so basically it has this format

121
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,520
select something from something

122
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,960
where

123
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,960
where something okay i haven't talked

124
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,120
about the way okay

125
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,960
so i write another sql and then you tell

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,120
me why it returns okay

127
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,039
select

128
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,880
name

129
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,440
from

130
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,919
pokemon

131
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,479
where

132
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:34,720
where uh sd

133
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:38,919
equal equal 105.

134
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,919
so what what does it return

135
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,840
okay yes because look slab name i

136
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,160
supposed to ask for the name lenfield

137
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,759
from pokemon yeah where st equals 105.

138
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,000
like you're telling me this

139
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,759
this is the condition i'm going to write

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,639
something more complex okay i'm going to

141
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
write

142
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,479
where where's here

143
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,440
we have here select the name from

144
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,840
pokemon where

145
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,800
where d is

146
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,759
is smaller and equal than 100 right

147
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,560
and

148
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,759
a

149
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,080
is bigger than 80.

150
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,759
okay so what does it give us

151
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,800
it gives us

152
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,800
black choice

153
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,680
okay so look this one is okay yeah and

154
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,680
then this one

155
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,960
d is more than 95

156
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,240
100 yes 95 smaller a is bigger than 155

157
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,240
okay

158
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,759
and any other ones

159
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,360
metaphrase

160
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,360
or 125 name otherwise has defense it

161
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
can't be more than

162
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,800
it should be less than equal than a

163
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,680
hundred right

164
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,599
okay

165
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,240
so it returns two names right two names

166
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,319
you can written

167
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,280
see that's something you can select name

168
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,120
hp whatever by by doing this yeah or you

169
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,199
can if you want to return all columns we

170
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,080
can give it uh

171
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,360
these

172
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,280
what do you call it wire char okay

173
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,440
wire chair so it means that everything

174
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,919
select everything from pokemon or

175
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,240
retainer table this where statement the

176
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,639
computer needs to check row by row and

177
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,560
if the pokemon has like a minion program

178
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,720
like it's going to take time right yeah

179
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,720
because that's linear search

180
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,840
and we talk about that and

181
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,080
we can

182
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,080
add the index index to it

183
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,120
indexes

184
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,280
right so what's the index remember we

185
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,280
talked about binary search tree

186
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,160
the binary search tree used to speed up

187
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,319
the search if it's bigger than 100 it's

188
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
on the right if it's smaller than 100

189
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,400
it's on the left the same thing here we

190
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,840
can add the index up to a particular

191
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,919
color

192
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,240
then you know different kinds of index

193
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,520
for example one simple way would be okay

194
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,560
if the attack from 0 to 50 it's

195
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,840
somewhere here if it's 50 to

196
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,879
51 to 100 stories somewhere here so if i

197
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,440
say okay well uh attack

198
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,280
where attack is 35

199
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,680
then the computer will just

200
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,080
look through the records in this this

201
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,560
bit right and not this big right

202
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,039
so we use the index to speed up the

203
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,160
search otherwise if now table does not

204
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,280
have index then computer can only do the

205
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,680
search in a very stupid way do it one by

206
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,399
one right and if it's a minion there's

207
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,800
the minion pokemon it's going to be very

208
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,200
very slow right because it has to check

209
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,240
a million pokemons to find out the

210
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
criteria the pokemon which matches your

211
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,920
criteria am i right

212
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,519
select something we can apply some

213
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,040
functions to it as well for example we

214
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,920
can say select

215
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,399
max

216
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,480
we want to select max attack from the

217
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,519
pokemon

218
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,760
then you'll tell us is 135 right

219
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,480
max mean

220
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,200
average right most kind of function this

221
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,160
is called aggregate function or sum

222
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,839
it's less sum right select sum hp then

223
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,200
you will tell us is that these numbers

224
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,519
ethically again

225
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,560
right that's that one basic

226
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,080
format of sql select very important slab

227
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,920
remember we talked about database to

228
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,519
retrieve the data

229
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,320
we put the data here

230
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,640
we can use the sql to retrieve the data

231
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,560
to quickly structure query language to

232
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,760
create a database right

233
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,600
select something from something

234
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,519
wear something ordered by something okay

235
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,920
wear something otherwise we talk about

236
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,920
all the way

237
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,720
yeah

238
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,040
makes sense it's easy easier it's easy

239
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,160
to understand all right

240
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,800
okay okay i'm going to give a quiz okay

241
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,760
we also find out the name and the hp of

242
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,360
the pokemon where it's attack speed

243
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,920
attack value is bigger than the

244
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,760
difference how can we write the sql

245
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,399
you don't need to look for it just write

246
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,880
the sql

247
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,880
select

248
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,800
from

249
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,480
pokemon this is a table name

250
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,800
and

251
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,800
where

252
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,279
attack is bigger than defense so a is

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,279
bigger than d

254
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,120
that's it and then the computer will run

255
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,040
through the vehicles and find out

256
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,399
the name and hp which the attack is

257
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,519
bigger than

258
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,720
defense so this one

259
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,920
this one

260
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,160
this one yeah yeah that's it from the

261
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,440
record we can order by we can ask it to

262
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,720
order by

263
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,200
order by

264
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,000
name alphabetically or ordered by the a

265
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,760
or d right ordered by a or d or whatever

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,640
right this is all the fields so you can

267
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,200
give a give a multiple column ordered by

268
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,120
these if there's an equal value then we

269
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,880
order by the second value

270
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,519
right

271
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,200
so this is how we query the table for

272
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,600
like these these kind of things right

273
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,279
yeah you search the browser for the

274
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,200
pokemon right

275
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,880
wait that's behind the scene basically

276
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,200
something like that right

277
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,839
this is one way rtms one way of solving

278
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,920
the data but we have other ways of

279
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,839
storing data but this is rdms the other

280
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,839
way you would be you know something like

281
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,360
that right stories

282
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,440
here layer right

283
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,959
it's not relational right

284
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,600
think this question will talk about the

285
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,000
next lesson if we want to store the

286
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,000
fight yeah different pokemons fight each

287
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,079
other right yeah

288
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,440
the result would be win lose draw right

289
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,519
all right

290
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,360
so how would you do it how do we store

291
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,920
in this table or is it better to do

292
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,640
something else if you do something else

293
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,079
that's right because yeah perfect

294
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,200
yes

295
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,200
yeah what's type of

296
00:11:55,040 --> 1193:02:47,295
very effective um

297
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,839
four times

298
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:05,600
affected for weaknesses

299
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:10,399
because some pokemon has venuses and

300
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,240
and scrubs okay dragonite and sleepy

301
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,320
both are dragon types and dragon is

302
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,800
super effective and dragon and dragon is

303
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,720
weakness against dragon and also that is

304
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,040
the same for ghosts

305
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,760
okay maybe i didn't explain the question

306
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,760
clearly what that means

307
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,560
we want to store the date the fight the

308
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,399
outcome of a fight between pokemons so

309
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,000
it's better we don't

310
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,480
mess up with this table because this

311
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,720
table it just restores the basic steps

312
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,720
right we can extend active columns right

313
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,279
but we can store another table called

314
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,040
called fights yeah we can have another

315
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,519
table called poison types are no

316
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,399
effective metagrams and for the type we

317
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,720
can have this pokemon a pokemon p

318
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,120
and a result

319
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,279
you see what i mean

320
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,279
okay

321
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,680
well it's not very effective against

322
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,040
dragonite

323
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,040
both means poison toxin

324
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,779
[Music]

325
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,600
my point is that we can store the data

326
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,160
in different tables we can store the

327
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,600
data in different tables so one table to

328
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,000
store the

329
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,760
basic style for pokemon one table store

330
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,800
the five results what else do you have

331
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,440
in your pokemon like

332
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,199
strengths and weaknesses string venus

333
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,440
does the pokemon have this equipment buy

334
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,040
the equipment no people can't buy

335
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,680
equipment they only need the train

336
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,519
account and then you poke a dollar but

337
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,120
when you lose to a battle against

338
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,360
another trainer you need to give them

339
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,399
money yeah

340
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,720
when you fight a trainer and

341
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,120
if you lose you have to give poker

342
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,959
dollars to the winner and

343
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,040
and if you win we're gonna have to give

344
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,440
you pocket dollars to you okay so

345
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,760
there's a kind of items and then you can

346
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,199
use the money to buy pokeballs potions

347
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,240
escape routes

348
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,839
pokemon can hold an item oh yeah pokemon

349
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,959
hold a item so one pokemon how many

350
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,800
items can you hold one just one

351
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,720
okay well if you want another one you

352
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,120
have to get rid of the item they're

353
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,120
holding

354
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,839
you have to remove one item there's also

355
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:46,480
ability and some ability mega venusaur

356
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,560
question if the pokemon i say if like

357
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,639
you can hold two items so how are we

358
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,399
going to store here it's not easy right

359
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,240
because look the problem with this table

360
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,880
is that one column

361
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,760
column rows columns right if if one

362
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,079
let's use one pokemon silicon has two

363
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,240
items how are you going to put it here

364
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,079
item one item two

365
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,800
you're going to squeeze two data into

366
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,279
one cell technically you can but it's

367
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,440
not very ideal so in this case

368
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,040
we're going to decouple this we're going

369
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,680
to take the two items we can have

370
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,040
another table called pokemon items

371
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,600
the columns will be pokemon and item

372
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,720
right so we can have two rows which is

373
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,399
silicon

374
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
silicon item one

375
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,199
and

376
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,800
second row will be silicon item two you

377
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,120
see what i mean

378
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,360
okay okay another thing i forgot to

379
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,480
mention is the table each table usually

380
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,360
have a primary key primary key

381
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,199
so here let's say primark is named

382
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,759
it has to be unique you can't have

383
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,600
separate rows called silicon

384
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,480
somehow here right because primary key

385
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,399
has to be unique so each node represents

386
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
a unique pokemon

387
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,759
primary key is kind of like index right

388
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,360
it's index also it's unique

389
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,880
okay so to sum up what have you learned

390
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,880
today about pokemons

391
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,639
so you know

392
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,720
about what what have you done what's the

393
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,560
takeaway today database q sql sql

394
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,440
perfect this is the structural query

395
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,079
language select something from somewhere

396
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,720
where the criteria met and we can have

397
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,120
order by right this is a basic format

398
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,199
and we're going to talk about the join

399
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,040
where sql can be joined let's see that

400
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,440
can be joined right we can select

401
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,199
something from these tables

402
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,959
now we will just left from one table we

403
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,040
can start from multiple tables for

404
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,759
example we can step from pokemon and

405
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,399
pokemon fights or pokemon items we can

406
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,079
join the table by some columns right

407
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,199
yeah i will talk about that in more

408
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,720
details in the next few lessons okay

409
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,160
ryan

410
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,199

411
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,199
something

412
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,399
something what

413
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,519
what have you learned

414
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,360
last question

415
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,720
about database

416
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,079
database particularly is sql right okay

417
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,600
yeah select a name from family

418
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,360
