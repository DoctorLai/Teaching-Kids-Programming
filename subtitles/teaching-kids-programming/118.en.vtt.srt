1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990

oh hello hello hello hello mr mr ryan

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
oh hello hello hello hello mr mr ryan
 

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,670
oh hello hello hello hello mr mr ryan
how are you today good

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,680
how are you today good
 

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,829
how are you today good
do you still remember a few weeks ago we

6
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
do you still remember a few weeks ago we
 

7
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,350
do you still remember a few weeks ago we
talked about permutation

8
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
talked about permutation
 

9
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,789
talked about permutation
yeah yeah like one two three

10
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:12,799
yeah yeah like one two three
 

11
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,470
yeah yeah like one two three
the pigmentation is

12
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
the pigmentation is
 

13
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,510
the pigmentation is
yeah one three two two one

14
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:19,520
yeah one three two two one
 

15
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,470
yeah one three two two one
three two three one three one two and

16
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
three two three one three one two and
 

17
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,349
three two three one three one two and
what's next what's the last one

18
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,359
what's next what's the last one
 

19
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,830
what's next what's the last one
three two one so let's permutation

20
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840

 

21
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,270

that's okay permutation is with orders

22
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
that's okay permutation is with orders
 

23
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,750
that's okay permutation is with orders
yes

24
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
yes
 

25
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,830
yes
do you get it yes so these are order and

26
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
do you get it yes so these are order and
 

27
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,030
do you get it yes so these are order and
how about i tell you

28
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
how about i tell you
 

29
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,229
how about i tell you
combination combinations

30
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239

 

31
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,310

this is without orders yeah if i tell

32
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
this is without orders yeah if i tell
 

33
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,750
this is without orders yeah if i tell
you pick three

34
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
you pick three
 

35
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,470
you pick three
pick two apples out of three how many

36
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,480
pick two apples out of three how many
 

37
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,069
pick two apples out of three how many
ways can you pick

38
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
ways can you pick
 

39
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,790
ways can you pick
you just pick two yes three times but if

40
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800
you just pick two yes three times but if
 

41
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,270
you just pick two yes three times but if
you

42
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
you
 

43
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,510
you
permeate two apples out of three how

44
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
permeate two apples out of three how
 

45
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,430
permeate two apples out of three how
many

46
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
many
 

47
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,710
many
three no so which look you said

48
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
three no so which look you said
 

49
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,270
three no so which look you said
three times three kinds of ways to pick

50
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
three times three kinds of ways to pick
 

51
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,950
three times three kinds of ways to pick
two apples after three right

52
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
two apples after three right
 

53
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,109
two apples after three right
when you pick two up there's three three

54
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
when you pick two up there's three three
 

55
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:11,990
when you pick two up there's three three
times away

56
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
times away
 

57
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,190
times away
when you pick pick it after you finish

58
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
when you pick pick it after you finish
 

59
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,749
when you pick pick it after you finish
pickings like for each one you have two

60
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
pickings like for each one you have two
 

61
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,469
pickings like for each one you have two
orders right

62
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
orders right
 

63
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,950
orders right
three times two so there are six right

64
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
three times two so there are six right
 

65
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,070
three times two so there are six right
correct

66
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
correct
 

67
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,710
correct
yeah so remember this permutation thing

68
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
yeah so remember this permutation thing
 

69
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,870
yeah so remember this permutation thing
how are we doing this we talk about the

70
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
how are we doing this we talk about the
 

71
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,109
how are we doing this we talk about the
recursive the permutation agreement

72
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
recursive the permutation agreement
 

73
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:31,590
recursive the permutation agreement
right

74
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
right
 

75
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,149
right
so basically we we have one two and

76
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
so basically we we have one two and
 

77
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,510
so basically we we have one two and
every time we

78
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
every time we
 

79
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,789
every time we
we switch swap with this element with

80
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
we switch swap with this element with
 

81
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,670
we switch swap with this element with
any of these

82
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
any of these
 

83
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,870
any of these
elements yeah and we swap it right

84
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
elements yeah and we swap it right
 

85
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,789
elements yeah and we swap it right
and then we continue continue remember

86
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
and then we continue continue remember
 

87
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,149
and then we continue continue remember
yeah

88
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
yeah
 

89
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,109
yeah
okay so today we talk about combination

90
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
okay so today we talk about combination
 

91
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,630
okay so today we talk about combination
combination okay so look

92
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
combination okay so look
 

93
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,950
combination okay so look
if i have n items if i have n items

94
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
if i have n items if i have n items
 

95
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,230
if i have n items if i have n items
and i want to pick k items what's the

96
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
and i want to pick k items what's the
 

97
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,310
and i want to pick k items what's the
what how many solutions do we have

98
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
what how many solutions do we have
 

99
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,550
what how many solutions do we have
remember this notation c

100
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
remember this notation c
 

101
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,630
remember this notation c
yeah c and k this this means to pick k

102
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
yeah c and k this this means to pick k
 

103
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,670
yeah c and k this this means to pick k
items out of n

104
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
items out of n
 

105
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,990
items out of n
right yeah all right so remember this p

106
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
right yeah all right so remember this p
 

107
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,750
right yeah all right so remember this p
p and k pick k items out of m but with

108
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
p and k pick k items out of m but with
 

109
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,390
p and k pick k items out of m but with
orders this is without orders yeah

110
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
orders this is without orders yeah
 

111
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,750
orders this is without orders yeah
all right so these equals

112
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
all right so these equals
 

113
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,869
all right so these equals
this is equals what p and k

114
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
this is equals what p and k
 

115
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,190
this is equals what p and k
right divided by what this is with

116
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
right divided by what this is with
 

117
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,790
right divided by what this is with
orders this is without order

118
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
orders this is without order
 

119
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,990
orders this is without order
so i have to divide divided by

120
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
so i have to divide divided by
 

121
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,190
so i have to divide divided by
k by what i have k c

122
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
k by what i have k c
 

123
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,470
k by what i have k c
and k okay what

124
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
and k okay what
 

125
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,229
and k okay what
look i have how many ways

126
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
look i have how many ways
 

127
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,229
look i have how many ways
how many ways of k items

128
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
how many ways of k items
 

129
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,309
how many ways of k items
with orders k permutations with orders

130
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
with orders k permutations with orders
 

131
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,270
with orders k permutations with orders
if not k any k numbers how many

132
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
if not k any k numbers how many
 

133
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,309
if not k any k numbers how many
solutions do we

134
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
solutions do we
 

135
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,589
solutions do we
have when we permutate k k

136
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
have when we permutate k k
 

137
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,030
have when we permutate k k
factorial okay yeah cake factory let's

138
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
factorial okay yeah cake factory let's
 

139
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,990
factorial okay yeah cake factory let's
very well done so this is with orders

140
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
very well done so this is with orders
 

141
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,070
very well done so this is with orders
this is without order so what do we need

142
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
this is without order so what do we need
 

143
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,869
this is without order so what do we need
to divide

144
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
to divide
 

145
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,630
to divide
here okay

146
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640

 

147
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,149

okay what fat

148
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159

 

149
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,589

yeah we picking this this

150
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
yeah we picking this this
 

151
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,589
yeah we picking this this
uh we can do it the other way look we

152
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
uh we can do it the other way look we
 

153
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,630
uh we can do it the other way look we
pick

154
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
pick
 

155
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,270
pick
first of all we pick k items but we

156
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
first of all we pick k items but we
 

157
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,190
first of all we pick k items but we
don't care about orders right

158
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
don't care about orders right
 

159
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,789
don't care about orders right
yes and how many orders for k items

160
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
yes and how many orders for k items
 

161
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,509
yes and how many orders for k items
k factorial yeah and then you times it

162
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
k factorial yeah and then you times it
 

163
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,070
k factorial yeah and then you times it
so

164
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
so
 

165
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,509
so
you can do it this way p and k equals k

166
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
you can do it this way p and k equals k
 

167
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,149
you can do it this way p and k equals k
factorial times c and k right it's the

168
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
factorial times c and k right it's the
 

169
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,229
factorial times c and k right it's the
same thing yeah

170
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
same thing yeah
 

171
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,869
same thing yeah
so p and k p and k equals one

172
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
so p and k p and k equals one
 

173
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,869
so p and k p and k equals one
p and k equals n factorial divided by

174
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
p and k equals n factorial divided by
 

175
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,670
p and k equals n factorial divided by
n minus k factorial okay this is the

176
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
n minus k factorial okay this is the
 

177
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,270
n minus k factorial okay this is the
formula formula okay

178
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
formula formula okay
 

179
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,429
formula formula okay
so c nk equals 1 n factorial divided by

180
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
so c nk equals 1 n factorial divided by
 

181
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,309
so c nk equals 1 n factorial divided by
k factorial and n minus k factorial am

182
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
k factorial and n minus k factorial am
 

183
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,030
k factorial and n minus k factorial am
right

184
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
right
 

185
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,990
right
yes does it make sense yeah okay so now

186
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
yes does it make sense yeah okay so now
 

187
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,110
yes does it make sense yeah okay so now
today

188
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120

pick two apples
how many ways i can pick two apples

220
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
how many ways i can pick two apples
 

221
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,350
how many ways i can pick two apples
these two apples

222
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
these two apples
 

223
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,510
these two apples
these two apples at least two lemons

224
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
these two apples at least two lemons
 

225
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,749
these two apples at least two lemons
right how many ways i can pick

226
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
right how many ways i can pick
 

227
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,790
right how many ways i can pick
one apple three look

228
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
one apple three look
 

229
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,510
one apple three look
every time i pick two apples there's one

230
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
every time i pick two apples there's one
 

231
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,550
every time i pick two apples there's one
apple yeah

232
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
apple yeah
 

233
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,790
apple yeah
all right i picked these two apple i

234
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
all right i picked these two apple i
 

235
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,710
all right i picked these two apple i
have this one apple i picked these two

236
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
have this one apple i picked these two
 

237
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,070
have this one apple i picked these two
but i have this one above

238
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
but i have this one above
 

239
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,670
but i have this one above
so does it make sense c n k equals c

240
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
so does it make sense c n k equals c
 

241
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,189
so does it make sense c n k equals c
n n minus k i'm right

242
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
n n minus k i'm right
 

243
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,110
n n minus k i'm right
today yes does it make sense

244
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
today yes does it make sense
 

245
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,510
today yes does it make sense
how many ways if i want to pick 99

246
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
how many ways if i want to pick 99
 

247
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,990
how many ways if i want to pick 99
apples out of 100

248
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,000

 

249

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,110
[Music]
199 100 yes we're done how how can we

252
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
199 100 yes we're done how how can we
 

253
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,670
199 100 yes we're done how how can we
tell it

254
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
tell it
 

255
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,550
tell it
because this equals one picking one

256
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
because this equals one picking one
 

257
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,629
because this equals one picking one
apples out of a hundred apples how many

258
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
apples out of a hundred apples how many
 

259
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,590
apples out of a hundred apples how many
of us

260
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
of us
 

261
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,430
of us
how many ways can you pick one up out of

262
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
how many ways can you pick one up out of
 

263
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,430
how many ways can you pick one up out of
a hundred acres

264
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
a hundred acres
 

265
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,550
a hundred acres
hundred a hundred a hundred good job

266
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
hundred a hundred a hundred good job
 

267
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,390
hundred a hundred a hundred good job
okay so now today look we need to

268
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
okay so now today look we need to
 

269
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,590
okay so now today look we need to
given a n and k

270
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
given a n and k
 

271
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,309
given a n and k
we want to return a list of the

272
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
we want to return a list of the
 

273
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,550
we want to return a list of the
combination solution

274
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
combination solution
 

275
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,309
combination solution
yeah how can we do it

276
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
yeah how can we do it
 

277
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,070
yeah how can we do it
how can we do

278
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080

 

279
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,029

first of all we know n the candidate is

280
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
first of all we know n the candidate is
 

281
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,510
first of all we know n the candidate is
apple

282
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
apple
 

283
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,629
apple
okay the apple is one two

284
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
okay the apple is one two
 

285
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,390
okay the apple is one two
three two n right yeah all right

286
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
three two n right yeah all right
 

287
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,629
three two n right yeah all right
all right yeah look at these valley

288
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
all right yeah look at these valley
 

289
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,830
all right yeah look at these valley
apples we need to pick

290
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
apples we need to pick
 

291
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,510
apples we need to pick
yeah we can pick we can pick right

292
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
yeah we can pick we can pick right
 

293
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,469
yeah we can pick we can pick right
i'll pick so this yeah when we pick one

294
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
i'll pick so this yeah when we pick one
 

295
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,590
i'll pick so this yeah when we pick one
yeah so for each one we can pick for

296
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
yeah so for each one we can pick for
 

297
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,309
yeah so for each one we can pick for
each one

298
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
each one
 

299
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,550
each one
when we are have less than k uppers we

300
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
when we are have less than k uppers we
 

301
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,629
when we are have less than k uppers we
can choose pick or not pick

302
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
can choose pick or not pick
 

303
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,270
can choose pick or not pick
right yeah does it make sense yeah so we

304
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
right yeah does it make sense yeah so we
 

305
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,189
right yeah does it make sense yeah so we
can do this recursively

306
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
can do this recursively
 

307
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,230
can do this recursively
so for each we have a function pick and

308
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
so for each we have a function pick and
 

309
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,189
so for each we have a function pick and
then

310
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
then
 

311
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,230
then
for these current apples okay we we we

312
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
for these current apples okay we we we
 

313
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,710
for these current apples okay we we we
can go from the left to the right

314
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
can go from the left to the right
 

315
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,189
can go from the left to the right
for each epoch we we we choose pick or

316
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
for each epoch we we we choose pick or
 

317
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,749
for each epoch we we we choose pick or
not pick

318
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
not pick
 

319
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,029
not pick
two solutions right all right yes

320
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
two solutions right all right yes
 

321
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,950
two solutions right all right yes
and when we have k apart we have a

322
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
and when we have k apart we have a
 

323
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,230
and when we have k apart we have a
solution i'm right

324
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
solution i'm right
 

325
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,029
solution i'm right
am right okay so let's do it

326
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039

 

327
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:25,270

define let's call it um

328
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280

 

329
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,710

okay put it in a list okay so

330
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
okay put it in a list okay so
 

331
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,469
okay put it in a list okay so
this answer variable is used to store

332
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
this answer variable is used to store
 

333
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,670
this answer variable is used to store
the solutions there so

334
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
the solutions there so
 

335
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,830
the solutions there so
so that will be containing the cnk

336
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840
so that will be containing the cnk
 

337
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,790
so that will be containing the cnk
solutions okay so now we have we can

338
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
solutions okay so now we have we can
 

339
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,270
solutions okay so now we have we can
define

340
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
define
 

341
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,629
define
a peak function peak function

342
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
a peak function peak function
 

343
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,350
a peak function peak function
look listen listen i'm going to test you

344
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
look listen listen i'm going to test you
 

345
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,230
look listen listen i'm going to test you
later okay

346
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
later okay
 

347
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,150
later okay
pick so currently we will have what

348
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
pick so currently we will have what
 

349
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,950
pick so currently we will have what
we will have uh left

350
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
we will have uh left
 

351
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,909
we will have uh left
left means that we have not the last

352
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919
left means that we have not the last
 

353
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,230
left means that we have not the last
apple we have picked is the left okay we

354
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
apple we have picked is the left okay we
 

355
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,830
apple we have picked is the left okay we
don't want to come back to again because

356
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
don't want to come back to again because
 

357
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,309
don't want to come back to again because
look

358
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,319
look
 

359
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,469
look
picking one two three is the same as

360
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
picking one two three is the same as
 

361
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,589
picking one two three is the same as
three to one yeah

362
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
three to one yeah
 

363
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,070
three to one yeah
these are repeated right am i right

364
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
these are repeated right am i right
 

365
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,670
these are repeated right am i right
because the combination does not have

366
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
because the combination does not have
 

367
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,110
because the combination does not have
orders right

368
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
orders right
 

369
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,110
orders right
picking one two three is the same as

370
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
picking one two three is the same as
 

371
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,469
picking one two three is the same as
speaking three to one

372
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
speaking three to one
 

373
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,070
speaking three to one
so we want to avoid this kind of

374
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
so we want to avoid this kind of
 

375
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,869
so we want to avoid this kind of
duplication so we can specify that

376
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
duplication so we can specify that
 

377
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,189
duplication so we can specify that
if we pick the last apple is three we

378
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
if we pick the last apple is three we
 

379
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,869
if we pick the last apple is three we
don't want to come back to pick

380
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
don't want to come back to pick
 

381
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,550
don't want to come back to pick
one and two again i'm right does it make

382
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
one and two again i'm right does it make
 

383
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,869
one and two again i'm right does it make
sense does it make sense

384
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
sense does it make sense
 

385
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,509
sense does it make sense
yeah so the left i know we have a

386
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
yeah so the left i know we have a
 

387
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,630
yeah so the left i know we have a
current solution

388
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
current solution
 

389
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,790
current solution
or a current solution look if

390
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
or a current solution look if
 

391
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,550
or a current solution look if
length of current if now we are picking

392
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
length of current if now we are picking
 

393
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,470
length of current if now we are picking
equal equal equal k if we have finished

394
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
equal equal equal k if we have finished
 

395
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,750
equal equal equal k if we have finished
we if we currently we have k elements in

396
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
we if we currently we have k elements in
 

397
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,230
we if we currently we have k elements in
the

398
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
the
 

399
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,710
the
in the basket let's say in the basket we

400
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
in the basket let's say in the basket we
 

401
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,350
in the basket let's say in the basket we
have k

402
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
have k
 

403
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,750
have k
apples in the basket what do we do we

404
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
apples in the basket what do we do we
 

405
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,750
apples in the basket what do we do we
now find a solution right

406
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
now find a solution right
 

407
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,350
now find a solution right
now we do it answer a pen

408
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
now we do it answer a pen
 

409
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,389
now we do it answer a pen
does it make sense append what

410
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
does it make sense append what
 

411
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,070
does it make sense append what
open the left current come on current

412
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
open the left current come on current
 

413
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,750

for apple in range last apple and n plus
 

469
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,509
for apple in range last apple and n plus
n plus one the last apple will be n

470
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
n plus one the last apple will be n
 

471
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,829
n plus one the last apple will be n
right will be number end

472
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
right will be number end
 

473

box box dot append
 

475
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,590
box box dot append
okay let's let's pick this apple okay

476
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
okay let's let's pick this apple okay
 

477
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,430
okay let's let's pick this apple okay
and then when we pick this apple we need

478
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
and then when we pick this apple we need
 

479
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,509
and then when we pick this apple we need
to try to pick the next airport so we

480
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
to try to pick the next airport so we
 

481
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,710
to try to pick the next airport so we
pick again

482
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
pick again
 

483
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,870
pick again
pick what apple

484
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880

 

485
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,710

plus one

486
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
plus one
 

487
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,870
plus one
all right and then this is the

488
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
all right and then this is the
 

489
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,630
all right and then this is the
interesting part when we pick this apple

490
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
interesting part when we pick this apple
 

491
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,030
interesting part when we pick this apple
we want to try not picking this airport

492
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
we want to try not picking this airport
 

493
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,949
we want to try not picking this airport
so box dot pop you take it out

494
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
so box dot pop you take it out
 

495
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,990
so box dot pop you take it out
yeah look box stop a pen the

496
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
yeah look box stop a pen the
 

497
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,750
yeah look box stop a pen the
economy currently will put this effort

498
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760
economy currently will put this effort
 

499
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,470
economy currently will put this effort
right and then when we pick this airport

500
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
right and then when we pick this airport
 

501
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,470
right and then when we pick this airport
we try

502
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
we try
 

503
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,670
we try
picking the next apple right yeah all

504
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
picking the next apple right yeah all
 

505
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,350
picking the next apple right yeah all
right and then we won't also

506
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
right and then we won't also
 

507
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,590
right and then we won't also
want to try without picking this apple

508
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
want to try without picking this apple
 

509
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,069
want to try without picking this apple
and then after this we can just return

510
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
and then after this we can just return
 

511
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,190
and then after this we can just return
a peek starting from pick the first

512
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
a peek starting from pick the first
 

513
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,750
a peek starting from pick the first
apple

514
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
apple
 

515
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,110
apple
okay thick reports ever and the current

516
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
okay thick reports ever and the current
 

517
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,030
okay thick reports ever and the current
basket is empty we just put it here

518
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
basket is empty we just put it here
 

519
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,990
basket is empty we just put it here
right

520
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
right
 

521
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,670
right
right and then return

522
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
right and then return
 

523
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,269
right and then return
answer okay look here there's a problem

524
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
answer okay look here there's a problem
 

525
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:33,910
answer okay look here there's a problem
because this

526
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
because this
 

527
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,949
because this
remember last time we talked about when

528
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
remember last time we talked about when
 

529
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,829
remember last time we talked about when
you append

530
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
you append
 

531
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,790
you append
this this is by reference right because

532
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
this this is by reference right because
 

533
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,350
this this is by reference right because
this box is a references it's an alias

534
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
this box is a references it's an alias
 

535
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,470
this box is a references it's an alias
so so we want to make a copy here so we

536
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
so so we want to make a copy here so we
 

537
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,269
so so we want to make a copy here so we
can use the diff copy box here right

538
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
can use the diff copy box here right
 

539
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,069
can use the diff copy box here right
deep copy box or we can simply use this

540
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
deep copy box or we can simply use this
 

541
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,310
deep copy box or we can simply use this
we can simply do this this is the same

542
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
we can simply do this this is the same
 

543
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,670
we can simply do this this is the same
as box

544
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
as box
 

545
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,590
as box
bracket just a single column okay

546
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
bracket just a single column okay
 

547
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,670
bracket just a single column okay
this means that i make a deep copy of

548
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
this means that i make a deep copy of
 

549
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,629
this means that i make a deep copy of
box

550
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
box
 

551
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,150
box
right doesn't make sense why we want to

552
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
right doesn't make sense why we want to
 

553
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,550
right doesn't make sense why we want to
make a big

554
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
make a big
 

555
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,790
make a big
box otherwise the box the content of the

556
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
box otherwise the box the content of the
 

557
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,470
box otherwise the box the content of the
box is always changing because

558
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
box is always changing because
 

559
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,030
box is always changing because
there's only one box right i want them

560
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
there's only one box right i want them
 

561
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,910
there's only one box right i want them
when i have

562
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
when i have
 

563
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,269
when i have
k and k apples in a box what i want to

do
i want to remember this solution and i

568
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
i want to remember this solution and i
 

569
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,509
i want to remember this solution and i
make a copy of box

make a copy of box
 

571
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,110
make a copy of box
and i put it in a solution does it make

572
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
and i put it in a solution does it make
 

573
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,430
and i put it in a solution does it make
sense all right i'm going to start with

574
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
sense all right i'm going to start with
 

575
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,629
sense all right i'm going to start with
picking stuff from

mean
what's the second parameter i was test

594
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
what's the second parameter i was test
 

595
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,629
what's the second parameter i was test
i'm testing you if you listen actually

596
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
i'm testing you if you listen actually
 

597
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,170
i'm testing you if you listen actually
right

[Music]

600
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
[Music]
 

601
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,509
[Music]
yes that's the box when we pick the

602
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
yes that's the box when we pick the
 

603
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,190
yes that's the box when we pick the
first apple we want to try

604
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
first apple we want to try
 

605
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,509
first apple we want to try
but at the beginning we have empty box

606
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
but at the beginning we have empty box
 

607
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,389
but at the beginning we have empty box
right

608
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
right
 

609
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,550
right
i'm right yeah and i can pick the first

610
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
i'm right yeah and i can pick the first
 

611
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,509
i'm right yeah and i can pick the first
airport right

612
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
airport right
 

613
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,509
airport right
when i pick the first airport i can pick

614
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
when i pick the first airport i can pick
 

615
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,790
when i pick the first airport i can pick
the next airport

616
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
the next airport
 

617
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,550
the next airport
and when when the box contains k

618
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
and when when the box contains k
 

619
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,550
and when when the box contains k
apples look when the box contains k a

620
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
apples look when the box contains k a
 

621
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,030
apples look when the box contains k a
plus what should we do

622
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
plus what should we do
 

623
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,750
plus what should we do
we should what should we do here

624
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760

 

625
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,509

we go we will say we know then we have

626
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
we go we will say we know then we have
 

627
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,430
we go we will say we know then we have
apple we have a solution of combination

628
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
apple we have a solution of combination
 

629
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,110
apple we have a solution of combination
right yeah okay okay so

630
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
right yeah okay okay so
 

631
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,949
right yeah okay okay so
what's the term complexity i'm just

632
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
what's the term complexity i'm just
 

633
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,269
what's the term complexity i'm just
testing what's the term complexity

634
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
testing what's the term complexity
 

635
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,790
testing what's the term complexity
what oh what it's not n anymore and they

636
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
what oh what it's not n anymore and they
 

637
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,389
what oh what it's not n anymore and they
say i know okay what

638
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
say i know okay what
 

639
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,590
say i know okay what
what's the complexion yeah sorry

640
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
what's the complexion yeah sorry
 

641
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,710
what's the complexion yeah sorry
i mean k what's n a k o c

642
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
i mean k what's n a k o c
 

643
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,590
i mean k what's n a k o c
and k right this is a combination

644
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
and k right this is a combination
 

645
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,310
and k right this is a combination
because

646
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
because
 

647
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,350
because
because this solution is to pick k

648
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
because this solution is to pick k
 

649
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,470
because this solution is to pick k
apples out of n and then how many

650
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
apples out of n and then how many
 

651
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,910
apples out of n and then how many
solutions are there that's c

652
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
solutions are there that's c
 

653
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,550
solutions are there that's c
and k right yeah so the term context is

654
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
and k right yeah so the term context is
 

655
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,750
and k right yeah so the term context is
oc and k

656
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
oc and k
 

657
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,269
oc and k
all right what's the space complexity o

658
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
all right what's the space complexity o
 

659
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,189
all right what's the space complexity o
k and k what's the space from length

660
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
k and k what's the space from length
 

661
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,590
k and k what's the space from length
yes it's the same because we have c and

662
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
yes it's the same because we have c and
 

663
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,990
yes it's the same because we have c and
k of solution put it in answer right

664
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
k of solution put it in answer right
