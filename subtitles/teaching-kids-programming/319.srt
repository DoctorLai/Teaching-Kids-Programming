1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,960
go

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,759
hello mister mister ryan how are you

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,200
today good okay so today we talked about

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,360
mass

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,120
you know concept it's called golden

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,679
ratio

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,560
golden ratio

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,199
what does it mean golden ratio

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,279
come on come on okay that's it

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
so if look

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,119
okay yes

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,000
so let's say if i have a

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,320
you know i have a mirror here somehow

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,120
what so if i let you undertand your

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,640
mirror okay and if i tell you like to

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,399
put a line

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,559
put a line a vertical line somewhere

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,160
where do would you like to put the

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,600
vertical line

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,520
in the middle

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,000
i love you

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,920
do you think in the middle is the most

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,800
elegant beautiful there's no right or

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,800
wrong answer you know

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,480
okay what's that

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,399
my answer okay okay that's it okay and

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,600
ryan what do you think you're going to

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,600
put a vertical line

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,840
vertical line just vertical and not much

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,159
horizontal

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,680
okay so what's this other personally

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,960
what's this

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,360
you don't know

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,720
just guess a rough guess

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,920
okay okay okay

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,680
yeah okay so not even a third no what's

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
that it's not

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,360
a fraction

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,600
no not equal

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,960
what's this bit how the

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,799
error says half i don't what's this

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,439
what do you determine this vertical line

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,439
is going to be

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960
uh or you just let them guess random gas

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,479
okay

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,320
okay there's no right or wrong answer

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,840
come on

48
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,000
come on

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,000
okay so man yeah

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,920
let's do this okay

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,880
look at my line

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,520
okay let's dash line okay so

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,600
how about if i tell you that okay if i

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,479
tell you listen if i tell you that okay

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,840
so there's a line separating that yeah

56
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,920
and then that would be

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,280
let's say this is a

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,319
and this is a this is b

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,720
okay

60
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,680
so this side is b this is size

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,280
a

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,520
this is size a this is size a plus b

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,520
okay why are you going to go with the

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,600
station again

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
okay and then

66
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,959
[Music]

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,239
if we have what if we only have one

68
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,480
all right if we have a plus b

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,720
which is this side okay a plus b which

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,360
is that the longer side

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,920
divided by the bigger side yeah bigger

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,920
side hey

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,400
if it's equal to what a a divided by b

74
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,400
okay

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,360
let's call this line

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,720
golden ratio listen have high resolution

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
if if this

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,560
so let's learn

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,239
you know two

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
two things the sum

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,400
of the two things

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,000
the ratio between and the sum to the

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,080
larger one it's the glacier simulation

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,959
with the larger one and the smaller one

85
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,680
so

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,879
in other words i have a line

87
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,959
okay and i have at least this is a

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,200
this is b

89
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,599
and if i can say a plus b the whole

90
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,400
thing divided by a

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,799
is the same as a divided by b now we

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,599
call this a golden ratio

93
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,440
the bigger side a let's a divided by b

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,120
are good and ratio

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,159
that's mathematics why is it golden

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,720
ratio it's golden so it means that okay

97
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,560
no you know ideally you put a line there

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,720
it's it's most beautiful right okay

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,840
i only say it's most beautiful but you

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,640
know it's it's more like you know good

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
it's not beautiful sorry no beautiful i

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
don't get

103
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,840
what

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,760
what

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,080
okay so you'll be like okay so let's say

106
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,959
it's golden ratio it's just the one

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,159
ideal way to put to to set

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,480
you know to divide the segment into two

109
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,480
okay

110
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,319
what's that

111
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,400
okay

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,120
okay okay so look

113
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,359
mathematically okay mathematically yeah

114
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,880
mathematically huh

115
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,880
we use this with symbol

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,800
together

117
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,360
this is greek uh greek greek greek

118
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,199
letters greek another quick

119
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,880
that looks like a vagabond yeah yeah

120
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,639
these are these yeah

121
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,560
these are these we call we call we

122
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,560
pronounce this as five

123
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,720
five p h i how do you pronounce this phi

124
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,960
five five okay

125
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,960
okay so now look if we rearrange this

126
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,680
look if we have this equation and we

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,280
want to rearrange it so how can we

128
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,160
arrange this one

129
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,440
okay

130
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,160
look i think

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,000
a divided by 4 equals four divided by

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,759
two right yeah

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
yeah all right

134
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,919
this is two this is two yeah

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,160
so how can we arrange this

136
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,759
eight times two

137
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,880
eight times two sixteen four times four

138
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,800
okay so same here same here

139
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,280
a square

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,800
equals a times b

141
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,840
plus a divided by 4 equal to 4. okay

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,360
what's this look what's

143
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,440
this what's this look if i said a square

144
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,280
minus b square

145
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,280
minus a b equals zero okay

146
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,880
okay i'm just okay so given this

147
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,120
equation how do you

148
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,600
you know put it together so you can put

149
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,600
it together

150
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,080
i'm just example okay so this is z is

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
two no no it's not no we want to find

152
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,400
out the value of b and a

153
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,680
right and now we're given this equation

154
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,160
and how can we

155
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,800
uh and you know

156
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,039
to make it a quadratic equation

157
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,880
make sense

158
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,479
so if it's on the other side of the

159
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,479
equation if we move to the right

160
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,639
left-hand side we need to put the

161
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,479
negative sign all right we talked about

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,080
this before right

163
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,680
yeah okay on the right-hand side is b

164
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,319
square if we move to the left-hand side

165
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,919
of the equation we need to put negative

166
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,160
right all right

167
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,960
yeah and this is the sense

168
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,840
so look if let's say if b equals one

169
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,840
okay

170
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,840
if let's say b equals one we want to

171
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,639
calculate a right because the golden

172
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,080
ratio is a divided by b

173
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,960
right will be the same a divided by b

174
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,400
equals a plus b the sum divided divided

175
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,919
by the larger sum okay that's the goal

176
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
generation okay

177
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,759
maybe yeah when i was

178
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,520
rephrasing it as a beautiful one maybe i

179
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,039
was not correct right it's just the

180
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,120
golden ratio

181
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,000
okay let's just remember this

182
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,000
okay so look if b equals one then we can

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,639
we can do one

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,479
x a squared minus y

185
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,880
minus a

186
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,960
minus one equals zero what's this

187
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,280
causative equation we talked about this

188
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,759
do you remember that the thing is yeah

189
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,440
the thing remember remember

190
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,440
the thingy what's going to call this

191
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,360
polar bear

192
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,800
okay okay

193
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,160
so this look at us

194
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
all right come on

195
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,919
go press it okay so this let's let's

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,759
solve this equation okay let me switch

197
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,759
the number how do we solve this equation

198
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,880
so we can use the five

199
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,919
to get it okay we can use the five the

200
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
phi

201
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,080
right

202
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,080
yeah fine

203
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,440
minus one

204
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,479
so this is the equation we're going to

205
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,039
solve all right remember we got a

206
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,039
quadratic equation

207
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,840
can i have your attention please

208
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,080
yeah okay we're listening come on come

209
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,000
back okay so how do we zone this

210
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,800
i haven't been doing anything yeah i'm

211
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,400
not i'm talking to eric what what's this

212
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
project equation yeah y

213
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,479
remember this do you still remember this

214
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,280
because every equation there are two

215
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,080
roots there are two rules of it

216
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,479
yeah

217
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,919
and you remind me 2 times a

218
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,399
minus b

219
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,279
plus minus

220
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,479
1

221
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,399
b squared minus 4 times ac and this is

222
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,680
the numerator we prove this in one of

223
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,800
the previous

224
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,560
video yeah

225
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,240
there are two roots of these so what's a

226
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,160
of this what's what's the a of this

227
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,279
equation

228
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,560
what's the a of this equation

229
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,800
what's the a

230
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,279
what's the a of this equation

231
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,200
it is uh

232
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,040
what's the a of this equation x squared

233
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,040
minus x minus one equals zero

234
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,640
okay what's the equation what's the

235
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,200
value of a

236
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,560
the value of a is

237
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,399
x squared

238
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,720
now x squared here what's the value of a

239
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,959
come on it's there x squared x squared

240
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,320
what's the value of a

241
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,519
x

242
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,839
squared

243
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,920
x squared what's the value of a x

244
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,800
squared x squared times what equals x

245
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,880
square

246
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,000
one what's the value of a

247
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,240
one

248
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,800
what's the value of b

249
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,800
plus b x minus x plus b

250
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,360
zero

251
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,360
plus zl times x will be zero the whole

252
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,480
thing will become what's the value of x

253
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,800
one

254
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,000
one is plus x this is minus x what's the

255
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,560
value of x

256
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,560
um what's the value of b sorry

257
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,399
b b

258
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,440
plus b

259
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,240
plus b equals one what's this what's

260
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,959
this term minus

261
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,360
so what's the value of b

262
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,360
what's the value

263
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,200
minus

264
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:12,240
minus one minus one

265
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
what's the value of c

266
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,360
minus one minus one

267
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
so

268
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,040
let's convert this yeah equals one 2

269
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,959
times a

270
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,880
minus b would be one

271
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:38,160
plus equal plus minus okay b square

272
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,120
b square one

273
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,880
one minus minus four equals one

274
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,959
one minus

275
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,680
minus four what's this what's the value

276
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,760
of this one minus minus four

277
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,680
one minus minus four

278
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,279
huh come on less

279
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,800
it's minus three

280
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,240
one minus minus four one minus four this

281
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,720
is minus three

282
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,600
i said minus three one minus minus y

283
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,240
equal

284
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,839
one minus one four equals five equals

285
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,000
five yeah you know that yeah if you say

286
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,079
one is minus is equal to plus yeah yeah

287
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,200
yeah five okay so there are no two loops

288
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,120
okay so

289
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,480
let's say two

290
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,240
1 plus

291
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,640
these and

292
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
1 plus 1 minus

293
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,959
square root of 5 divided by 2. do we

294
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,600
know the value of

295
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,839
this mommy teaches me that

296
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,560
yeah okay so what's the value of this

297
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,120
okay square root of five you know we

298
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,360
talked about how to estimate using one

299
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,680
method before right 3.1

300
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,839
2.1 now

301
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,839
it's quite close how about you

302
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,839
what's the value of this very close it's

303
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
okay

304
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,800
because this is the irrational number

305
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,760
yeah remember you made one i don't know

306
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,000
how to spell this investigation

307
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,680
oh i saw that in the match station yeah

308
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,399
yeah

309
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,399
what's going on

310
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,800
okay very close but not yet okay

311
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,000
equation number is the fraction that

312
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,399
cannot be represented by p divided by q

313
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,680
where p and q are integer and q is not

314
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,760
zero okay and simp

315
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,399
rational number is the opposite it's the

316
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,399
why isn't it

317
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,440
okay okay let's use it

318
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,440
okay i use a calculator okay because

319
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,560
i use the calculator well i want to get

320
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:42,720
the see that password that's okay that's

321
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:48,320
okay come on can you sit by 11. oh yeah

322
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:50,560
okay 2.25 times 2.25 equals five

323
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,560
five point zero

324
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,560
five

325
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,839
23

326
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,279
times 2.23

327
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,279
okay so any

328
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,279
4.9729

329
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,040
no 2.232

330
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,600
times

331
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,839
2.232

332
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,959
equals

333
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,760
yeah

334
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,279
so it's roughly two point two

335
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,760
three

336
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,920
two maybe yeah

337
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:35,040
i don't know i i need to check okay 3.33

338
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,040
how about two points

339
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,079
okay two point two three six okay the

340
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,079
answer is two point two three six here

341
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,480
two point two three six okay let's say

342
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,120
two point two six six because look at

343
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,000
this number two point two three six

344
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,440
times two point two three six

345
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,639
equals four point nine nine nine nine

346
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,639
it's very close to five right

347
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,120
so this is number it's very close to

348
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,360
five okay okay let's see so

349
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,360
so look this is the we talk about

350
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,440
fraction number yeah because look at 100

351
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,240
divided by a this is a simple fraction

352
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,079
number yeah and then there's some number

353
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,120
which is irrational but we talked about

354
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,120
easier pi remember

355
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,680
this is irrational number and then look

356
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,800
this equal

357
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,680
approximately equal to 2.236 and we want

358
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,600
to

359
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,240
calculate this yeah we want to check

360
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,720
your list so let's pack this value in

361
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,720
equals

362
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:39,199
2.266 and this whole thing is equal

363
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,680
3.236 divided by 2. what's this

364
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,680
what's this

365
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,120
3.236 divided by 2. come on what's this

366
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,240
1.618 right

367
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,639
yeah

368
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,639
am i right

369
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,339
yes

370
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,339
[Music]

371
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,600
3.236 divided by 2 equals 1.618 yeah i

372
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,560
just show you right

373
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,480
okay 1.68 okay this is approaching the

374
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,639
golden ratio okay this is the value

375
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,880
remember

376
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,920
1.618 yeah how we get it remember how we

377
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,880
get it

378
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,279
x square minus x minus one equals this

379
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,199
one rule yeah two one

380
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,160
and the other rule yeah the other root

381
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,079
is one

382
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,079
one minus

383
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,399
this well this is the two root and this

384
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:34,160
is equals to minus

385
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,399
0.618 okay this is minus

386
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,399
okay

387
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,360
okay so look how do we estimate this

388
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,160
yeah remember we talked about fibonacci

389
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,160
number yeah yeah what's fibonacci number

390
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,440
come on give me a few seconds one one

391
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,480
two

392
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,079
three five five hey eight

393
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
21

394
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,480
35

395
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,480
60

396
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:06,639
no no no 56 and what's next

397
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,639
uh i'm so just 91. okay yeah it's 91.

398
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,600
yes why you say just kidding it's 91

399
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,560
okay

400
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,279
okay

401
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,120
okay so why are we starting this again

402
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,920
look if this is the value the first

403
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,519
value is b the second value is a

404
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,360
what's the next value

405
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,000
what's the next value

406
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,440
what's the next video p-a

407
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,639
it's 147. yeah p-a and the next one is b

408
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,440
plus a yeah a plus b okay am i

409
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,600
okay

410
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,040
okay that's it that's it look

411
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,600
b a a a plus b okay right this is the

412
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,160
consecutive uh three terms okay the

413
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,240
ratio okay let's say if this is going

414
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,040
big you know because this sequence is

415
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,440
going infinity right it's going infinity

416
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,000
right i'm right so the ratio between

417
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,160
these two will be converged will

418
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,680
converge to a value let's look

419
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,560
look

420
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,079
look look a plus b

421
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,079
divided by a equals a divided by b what

422
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,319
have you noticed what have you noticed

423
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,360
look at this what have you noticed look

424
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,439
it's b the the fibonacci sequence b a

425
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,520
and the next items a plus b

426
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,000
yeah come on

427
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,760
because this this a and b is going

428
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,919
infinity yeah it's going to

429
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,679
infinity so we can say it's converge we

430
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,160
have the ratio of converge and look the

431
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,640
ratio between a plus b divided by a is

432
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,799
the same as a divided b b so what are we

433
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,000
talking about here remember

434
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,520
what's this

435
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,440
what's this

436
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,120
this is a this is b

437
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,520
the whole thing

438
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,600
come on the whole thing a plus b divided

439
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,320
by a equals a divided by b so what's

440
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,760
this binary search what's this

441
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,720
what have we talked about is the word

442
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,720
here we what is

443
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,360
yeah

444
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,080
that's what we study okay so if we

445
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,559
ideally if we we uh

446
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,400
we printed out the uh so if we keep

447
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,400
going this fibonacci number

448
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,400
so we will find the golden ratio okay

449
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,960
look so we can say okay n equal a

450
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,880
thousand maybe then we can say a equals

451
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,160
one b equals one

452
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,320
four

453
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,360
for underscore

454
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,799
in

455
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,679
range

456
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,080
and then look at a b and what's the next

457
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,280
item it will be b and then a plus b

458
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,000
right and if the understand we bring

459
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,880
if we find the value final value which

460
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,520
what's the value of it b is bigger yeah

461
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
b

462
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,760
times one point zero we want to convert

463
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,080
it this integer to the floating number

464
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,600
divided by a

465
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,559
and you will see you will see the

466
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,559
numbers

467
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,240
golden ratio converts yeah so then

468
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,720
finally the coordination will be this

469
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,360
number b times 1.0 divided by at least

470
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,240
is the golden ratio five five

471
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,960
okay

472
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,600
so

473
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,120
let's do this what's the one 147 divided

474
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,799
by 91 okay

475
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,120
what's 66

476
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,880
no you see one one four seven are you

477
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,840
sure

478
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,440
147

479
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,720
divided by

480
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,240
91

481
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,200
1.615 right you see

482
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,640
it's very close to

483
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,480
1.618 this is the golden ratio we just

484
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,840
talked about okay so let's try next item

485
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,000
next new item what's in the next few

486
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,559
items next few items is one

487
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,919
what's this what's this one divided by

488
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,600
no no no 147 plus

489
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,440
91 equals one two three eight

490
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,559
okay and now what's next what's next

491
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,880
number

492
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,679
plus one four seven

493
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,640
three eight five and and then

494
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,640
last two three eight

495
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,160
two three yeah okay so let's let's let's

496
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,440
calculate this ratio yeah this this

497
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:49,039
value divided by this okay

498
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,960
six two three divided by three a five

499
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:55,480
equals look look look we got the

500
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,480
children ratio yeah you see 1.618

501
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,559
you see

502
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,480
so that's the beauty fibonacci number

503
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,280
when it goes infinity

504
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,440
the next item the ratio between the next

505
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,480
item and the current item will be

506
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,600
converging to 1.618.

507
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,360
yeah let's go

508
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,400
you can find many many

509
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,120
uh instances many many things you know

510
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,880
the the nature yeah or mathematics you

511
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,400
know many many things they obtain this

512
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,679
golden ratio

513
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,799
law

514
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,679
all right look this is at b this is a

515
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:33,039
the next item is a plus b okay

516
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,039
yeah so a plus b

517
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,679
divided by a equals a divided by b okay

518
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,919
so this is the relation okay

519
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,440
all right makes sense

520
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,600
so we have what have we learned so far

521
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,280
today the golden ratio and what's that

522
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,600
what's that can you explain to me what's

523
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
going on

524
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,559
so look if there is a segment and this

525
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,640
is a this is b and what's the golden

526
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,159
ratio how confidently

527
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,170
what's happening

528
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,880
so what's the golden ratio a and b

529
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,840
[Music]

530
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,120
what the last sum always the sum

531
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,880
divided by which one a or b the larger

532
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,320
sum yeah

533
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,720
all right one

534
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,720
equals one

535
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,919
a plus b times b equals a square right

536
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,960
and this is a b plus b square equals a

537
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,840
squared

538
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,720
okay this is look if this is b if b is

539
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,120
one then we can say

540
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,159
a plus one equals a squared right and

541
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,559
then we go to let's go to what a square

542
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,000
minus a minus one equals zero and we

543
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,320
already know how to solve this using

544
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,320
causative equation yeah

545
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,400
yeah two a's

546
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,520
the root will be one plus there are two

547
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,799
roots yeah one plus square root of five

548
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,360
and one

549
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,200
uh 1 minus square root of 5 divided by 2

550
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,600
and then we talk about how to estimate

551
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,760
the square root of 5 right yeah the

552
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,320
other way of estimating the square root

553
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,480
of 5 how can we extend it look

554
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,880
what square root of 5. let's say what's

555
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,039
the biggest square root let's say that

556
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,440
gives us you know

557
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,880
what's the biggest square root integer

558
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,360
part

559
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,039
is it going to be three

560
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,440
three point something or two point

561
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:29,280
something

562
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,280
which which one square root of five

563
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,640
six point something yeah because three

564
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,159
point something would be nine right over

565
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,799
nine right two point something is less

566
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,799
than five right yeah okay so let's say

567
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,000
two plus this is two point something x

568
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,720
squared

569
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,200
equals 5 right yeah this is the small

570
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,559
part okay and then look

571
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,159
remember

572
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,880
a plus b

573
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,159
square equals a squared plus b squared

574
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,960
plus 2 a b right all right

575
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,559
so we we know this x square

576
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,000
this s squared because this is a

577
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,400
fraction it's very small we can just

578
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,640
abandon it for for now then let's say

579
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,600
2 squared plus 2 times

580
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,679
a b that'll be four x equals five

581
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,799
yeah because there's a less s square

582
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,720
here right

583
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,280
let's say s square here but it's too

584
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,400
small let's forget it about now so four

585
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,200
plus four x equals five what's x

586
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,200
uh

587
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,440
a quarter right

588
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,799
0.25 okay so now we have the good

589
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,120
estimation we're plugging back so that's

590
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,039
2.25 plus x

591
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,720
yeah so that's the

592
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,360
eric look

593
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,000
yeah 2.25 you get 2.95 right at the

594
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,200
beginning right yes yeah that's how we

595
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,320
get get it

596
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,880
you know

597
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,960
you get it and then 2.25 plus x

598
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,880
squared square equals five and we keep

599
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,360
doing this until we get a very good

600
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,960
estimation okay yeah

601
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,640
okay let's say for today i feel like

602
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,320
talk too much today

603
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,960
bye bye bye

604
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,960
bye bye
