00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,279
okay yeah how about nine no let's just

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,480
make it simpler we have a one p

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,080
one p coins five p coins

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:30,720
ten p coins twenty five p points

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:34,320
right twenty p coins okay let's

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,960
just make it 25 no no no no you're right

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
it's american it's not it's not uh it's

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,840
it's uh it's

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
it's not british okay it's america's

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,320
change okay american chance

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
in this program we're not american yeah

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,360
american

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,079
denominations okay so that's one sense

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,840
it's one sentence five cents

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,520
yes okay okay let's let's look at two

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,360
thanks okay

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,719
let's just make it these four numbers

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,000
one five ten twenty

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,120
twenty five yeah and you let's say

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,799
if you want to give people like

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,600
money like that let's say you want to

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,840
give us six what's the minimum

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,760
coins you need to that will come up with

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,600
six does it have to be exactly

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,799
yeah of course there are six one five

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,400
yeah one five yeah

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,840
two yeah you're all right and how about

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,880
five five

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,000
how many one okay how about

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,400
three uh

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
three ones yeah that's one one one three

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,920
okay so you get the meaning yeah if i

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,680
give you a number like uh

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,799
12 you need to tell me

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,799
yeah okay exactly okay so that's that's

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,200
how we make the change so we also know

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,520
how

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,720
the minimum the mean number of coins

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,600
they make up

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,600
the money the target money yeah does it

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,000
make sense

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,280
right yeah you understand the problem

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,399
yeah

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,079
so how can we do this how can we do it

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,119
remember look at this one is a very

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,320
special

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,640
case it means that the we can all make

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,960
it

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,520
one right yeah so you'll be less than

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,720
the number okay you give it a number n

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,800
yeah define how

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,160
how what's your approach of doing this

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,640
define

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,640
uh change making change make sure

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
like if a number is 12 like after you

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
said

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,959
the small the smallest coin which is

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,680
is 10. and then you have remaining of

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,720
two

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,519
and the tomorrow

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,560
okay so i understand your approach so

66
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,760
why not find

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,640
a largest largest coin that

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,920
is smaller than the target right and now

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,239
we use that coin and i will repeat this

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,800
yeah

71
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,319
subtract that right yeah yeah does it

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,120
make sense how about

73
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,120
uh okay

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,319
so answer we want the answer yeah

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,440
okay yeah answer and now

76
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,720
look for

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,840
the coins yeah eric look four coins in

78
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,200
how many coins there let's uh

79
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,640
we try the biggest one first 25 10

80
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,440
5 1 right yes

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,319
it doesn't have to be these ones no we

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,319
yeah we know

83
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,920
these four coins and we want to try the

84
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,239
coin let's say we're going to try to

85
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,040
have to beat these coins yes yeah that's

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,599
the given

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,640
given we know it's four points so he

88
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,040
doesn't have to have

89
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,519
1 5 10 25 no no no no yeah we are trying

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,440
so look we want to find out the largest

91
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,680
coin that is smaller than n

92
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,680
right

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,760
why is in reverse order do you

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,840
understand because we want to

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:59,680
try the largest one yeah yeah yeah yeah

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,319
but it is not always 1 5 10 25.

97
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,560
then you put it maybe you want 20 40 20

98
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,840
here or 22 here yeah

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,200
this makes sense look look so now

100
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,080
so what so so

101
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,400
how do we try the largest number that is

102
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,799
no

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,799
more than uh no more than a target

104
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,880
any idea how we're doing this oh i think

105
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,560
we start at the smallness

106
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,800
no we'll start with the black lives

107
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,800
matter

108
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:39,989
[Music]

109
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
okay so look so how many coins can can

110
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,800
we use the

111
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,080
c 25 so look now we are n right so this

112
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,280
coin

113
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,080
will be n divided by 25 right

114
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,759
doesn't make sense if it's more than 25

115
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,960
like 26 you will you need

116
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,479
125 right if you're less than 25 like 24

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,759
this will become zero right

118
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,560
yeah this coin okay then

119
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,280
how many how many of these answer plus

120
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,320
equally

121
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,360
right does it make sense yeah

122
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,960
why okay yeah does it make sense this is

123
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,520
the number of the coins

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,800
of the current actually not 25 is

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,800
divided by c

126
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,440
right all right yeah look

127
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,160
come on don't work here in there okay 26

128
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,479
okay

129
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,280
and divided by c this is the number of

130
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,320
coins

131
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,199
that this is a number least number of

132
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,199
c coins and with this answer we add it

133
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,320
to the answer and then now what

134
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,320
i do i need to remove it n minus equals

135
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,280
please comes one

136
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,840
i just at least comes with end coin now

137
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,160
we are

138
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,520
we want to make up n choice but now we

139
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,320
know you need

140
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,120
your time c and then what should we do

141
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,800
if it becomes

142
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,840
zero it becomes yellow so we do

143
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,120
we return it whether i'll break the loop

144
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,960
yeah break the loop

145
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,479
they break it will break this loop and

146
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,560
then return answer yeah

147
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,639
yep yeah or or you can just directly

148
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,840
return answer here it's the same yeah

149
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,360
return your written answer but you you

150
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,199
if you write an answer then you don't

151
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,520
need to write here but it'll be better

152
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,199
if you just return

153
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,440
because we want to beat an answer when

154
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,039
it's zero right it when it becomes zero

155
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,120
you want to return zero so

156
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,319
we just break break what's what does

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,600
break mean

158
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:35,039
break with double link yeah we just

159
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,280
normally being a

160
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,560
so break loop means that yeah we don't

161
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,840
want to continue with the loop

162
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,319
right we just we just skip

163
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,840
no skip we should exit let me determine

164
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,440
yeah it doesn't make sense

165
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:53,680
yeah yeah okay i'm going to do it

166
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,919
okay what's this i remove one thing here

167
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,919
um

168
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,199
yeah because we need least number of

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,520
coins yeah

170
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,520
okay okay what's the time complexity

171
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:17,840
oh one what what

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
i win

173
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,960
[Music]

174
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,960
yeah because we only tried four

175
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,639
iterations we already know it's four

176
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,199
integration this doesn't change

177
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,759
and look this calculation is this all

178
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,160
right

179
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,599
this calculation we can we can it's the

180
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,639
same thing as look look

181
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,639
this one this one yeah this is the four

182
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,120
iterations of calculations so basically

183
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,479
we want to know

184
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,520
we can determine look return and

185
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,960
how many nodes of 25 yeah how many coins

186
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,199
of 25 yeah

187
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:05,120
all right this number of 25 coins plus

188
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:08,240
and you remain 25 right and then

189
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,960
what and then 125 how many

190
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,080
20 how many how many 10 are there right

191
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,680
you remain 25

192
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:19,199
divided by 10 plus remain 25

193
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,599
and then we meant 10 how many five of

194
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,759
that

195
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,960
right and plus and remain 25

196
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,520
remain the 10 remain 5 how many one of

197
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,759
them that's

198
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,120
right no that's it doesn't make sense

199
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,840
the least can be turned

200
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,840
into one line

201
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,560
this is the number of 25 yeah plus

202
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,360
remaining of 25 is this big look

203
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,320
this bit is this speed yeah we speed and

204
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
now we need to

205
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,839
we divide it by 10 to compute how many

206
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,120
10

207
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,480
coins we need and then we we

208
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,959
this number keep dividing uh remaining

209
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,920
ten

210
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,519
and how many five of them yeah and then

211
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,360
the next is how many one of them

212
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,040
doesn't make sense so these can be

213
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,279
changed into these

214
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,080
yeah but this is more straightforward

215
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,200
approach yeah

216
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,240
we agreed we could easily try

217
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,480
the largest coin right right

218
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,880
we tried the largest comb 25 and then we

219
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,040
tried 10 we tried five we tried one

220
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,880
doesn't make sense yes all right

221
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,080
how about we can use the dynamic

222
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,600
programming in this case

223
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,519
remember we can use the dynamic

224
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,720
programming error you don't need

225
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,480
memorization

226
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:36,560
uh yes yes uh not top down button

227
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,600
he's in the cache maybe maybe we don't

228
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,959
another solution look you just remember

229
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
that the term convex is

230
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,160
a one for that and our space complexity

231
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,240
is also one right

232
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,360
because we're not uh allocating any more

233
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,200
space for that right

234
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,800
it's always this is very optimal

235
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,480
solution but look

236
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:58,640
if we use the dp function right

237
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,640
look if fn let's say

238
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,760
if n fm means that the number of

239
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,640
minimum coins to represent

240
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,040
to come up with the target n right yeah

241
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,000
and

242
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,000
you will be equal s

243
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,720
equals mean of all these f

244
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,240
m minus i

245
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,519
right look where

246
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,640
where what i

247
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:34,399
is one two

248
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,519
one 5 10 25 right

249
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:42,320
does it make sense yeah will

250
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:46,000
yeah look fn is the number of the coins

251
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,040
minimum coins to store to come up with

252
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
m and then we know we know we have four

253
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,279
choice

254
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,920
so it must be no you know

255
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,720
today and plus one sorry plus one

256
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,720
because we need

257
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,399
one one more right yes doesn't make

258
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,279
sense look

259
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,279
f12

260
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,320
the number of ways the number the

261
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,160
minimum coins

262
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,760
to come up with 12 is equal to

263
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,200
mean of all these yeah f 12

264
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:23,519
minus one no no f two plus minus one

265
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,839
f two l minus five f two l minus ten

266
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,320
and f two n minus twenty five okay and

267
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,399
then really

268
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,240
yeah because this is too small so yeah

269
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,079
this is too small plus one right

270
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,240
doesn't make sense so it means these

271
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,440
they're they're the previous we can have

272
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,120
f2 right

273
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,399
if we know f2 all right

274
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,519
if we know that f2 we know f2f is f2

275
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,120
plus one right

276
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,360
because f2l is two plus ten right

277
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,560
yeah and we have ten coins does it make

278
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,680
sense very

279
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,570
doesn't make sense this one kind

280
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,360
of yes

281
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,959
[Music]

282
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:09,200
can you tell me why why is this f12

283
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:13,839
f2l equals f2m f5

284
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,839
f7 class one can you tell me what's this

285
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,320
f equals

286
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,320
yeah i mean

287
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,519
yeah yeah mean okay so why why is mean

288
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,720
yeah you're right

289
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,399
this is mean why why is that

290
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,839
because we want to make up 12

291
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:39,279
right yeah and we know that f7 if we

292
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,279
because we have 5 so we know f7 that

293
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,720
the difference between this is that we

294
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,040
have seven and we just need

295
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,079
another five right yeah this is one

296
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,920
solution right

297
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,440
and then if we keep iterating this then

298
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,959
we can find the fn right

299
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,000
doesn't make sense let's try this okay

300
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,440
all right pay attention you you're

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,279
losing track you know define

302
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,560
fm what's missing good okay now look

303
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:09,040
dp let's do it dps dp course

304
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,320
at the beginning we set it to a maximum

305
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,600
value we have float

306
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,920
or max dot infinite

307
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,920
infinity yeah math

308
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,720
times n plus one yeah because of that we

309
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,320
want to

310
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,320
access fn right and dt zlo will be equal

311
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,040
to zero okay

312
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,600
the number of ways to come up with the

313
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,880
nothing

314
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:39,760
is nothing right yeah now look

315
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,760
for i in range

316
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,360
one m plus one right this is from f1 to

317
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,040
n

318
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,120
for coin in

319
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,800
yeah you all you can use this is the set

320
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,920
1 5

321
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,639
10 25 right yeah all right

322
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,320
look we don't try the coins and then we

323
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,600
want to calculate dp

324
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,639
i yeah dpi from one to n right so the

325
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,320
answer will be p p

326
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,320
one the tp1 the answer return tp1

327
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:19,839
what ppy well i'll get calculating here

328
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:23,279
see no no no dp1 no i just said

329
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,320
this is one sorry

330
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,639
f f n is the number of dpn is the number

331
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,839
of the coins

332
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,839
needed to make up the target end return

333
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:41,519
dpn come on oh dpm dp

334
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:46,160
minus one right yeah the last one right

335
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:49,199
now look we are currently targeting

336
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,040
the number i and then we have coin

337
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:56,240
c if i bigger than

338
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,199
or equal then c right yeah yeah we have

339
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,880
25 coins

340
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,600
if if 25 10 is bigger than one of these

341
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,639
number if

342
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,680
right and

343
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,360
and what dp i

344
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,959
minus c is not equals to maximum

345
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:19,920
to the infinite area to the inf

346
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:22,959
and then right because the dpi minus c

347
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,240
we know we haven't uh

348
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:29,920
we know how to make it up right

349
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,880
doesn't make sense yeah because the

350
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,600
beginning is

351
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:38,639
infinity if if this dp i'm if i minus c

352
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,360
amount we we don't know how to

353
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,680
make it up we don't know how to come up

354
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,399
with

355
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,839
i minus c then we don't continue

356
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,199
otherwise

357
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,639
dpi equals mean

358
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:57,680
error can you tell me what was here dpi

359
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,680
i minus c uh

360
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,880
bracket plus one dpi

361
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,880
right does that make sense

362
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,279
yeah we want to compute the dpi minimum

363
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,320
dpi value right does it make sense

364
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,320
is it is it

365
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,399
dp minus 1 the last letter dpn dpn

366
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,120
is the number okay let's do this again

367
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,920
dpn

368
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,120
is the number of coins the minimum

369
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,240
number of coins

370
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,800
if we want to make up n uh

371
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,920
money and amount of n right you want to

372
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,519
come up with the

373
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,240
give if i want to give you amount of end

374
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,199
coins

375
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,680
yeah then you will be stored in dpn

376
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,279
right

377
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,759
right db0 is 0

378
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,880
why is that because like at the

379
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,160
beginning it's nothing

380
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,120
right yeah then the first

381
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,240
iteration i want to compute the i dpi

382
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,839
from dp1 to dp2 to dp and my

383
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,679
n right yeah this is butter up

384
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:12,240
butter butter up water up

385
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,439
dynamic programming right yeah and then

386
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,919
for each one

387
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,400
i know we have four choice four coins

388
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,160
one five ten twenty five

389
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,919
if if current amount i is bigger than

390
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,880
the coins right

391
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,400
if it's if it's bigger than the coins if

392
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,960
it's smaller than the coin what does it

393
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,600
mean

394
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,320
you're given too much but if i want 10

395
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,160
10 coins

396
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,320
you'll give me 25 this doesn't make

397
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,000
sense right yeah

398
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,400
yeah if i is bigger than c if the number

399
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,480
the money is bigger than the coins the

400
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,919
total amount is bigger than the coins

401
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,400
and if i subtract the coins

402
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,080
yeah we know already if we already know

403
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,280
the number of coins

404
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,480
to make make up i minus the amount

405
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,520
then ppi is equal to

406
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,440
the mean minimum of this value dpi minus

407
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,840
e plus one can you tell me why we plus

408
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,840
one here

409
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,080
because what

410
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,000
why are we plus one what does it mean

411
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,120
can you explain to me

412
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,080
why is the last one oh

413
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,360
because i you know it's not that's

414
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,240
because we're using we

415
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,400
which coin are we using we're using

416
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,080
cornwall

417
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,840
base note i mean yes no no we which coin

418
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,720
are we using i mean

419
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,280
c c of course if because we use one c

420
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,799
then this

421
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,559
is the number of coins adding one more

422
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,679
coin c right doesn't make sense

423
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,160
yeah you get it right yeah we we

424
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,720
use one c coin and then the amount we

425
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,160
substitute

426
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,799
c right does it make sense this is the

427
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,120
amount

428
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,000
we are only making we want to make a

429
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,039
mouse i

430
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,360
and we can use one corner c but

431
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,640
then we substitute the amount from i now

432
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,799
we add one

433
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,760
coin because we use one currency right

434
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,799
that makes sense

435
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,440
now it's clear what's the time

436
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,440
complexity

437
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,080
why is the one

438
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,600
because look this is n yeah we're

439
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,520
iterating n times

440
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,600
but this one we're only eating it in

441
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,799
four times so it's actually

442
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,600
o four times n but we drop the

443
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,600
constant what's the space complexity

444
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:39,840
are we using the space here and here

445
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
we always use in space look why is the

446
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,480
bottom up because we're calculating the

447
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:53,840
tp1 dp2 db3 until we get the tpi

448
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,840
right ready

449
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,159
which one is better do you think this

450
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,480
this solution is better on the previous

451
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,120
one

452
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,240
previous previous why is that oh because

453
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,799
it's faster

454
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,520
why is that one is faster than this o n

455
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,799
right

456
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,960
yeah and time complexity is a one

457
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,440
compared to one here space complexity is

458
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,480
a one compared to space uh complexity oh

459
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,400
and yeah right

460
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,799
yeah so the previous one is optimum

461
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,880
you can't get better than that right one

462
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:37,919
is the farthest you can't get

463
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,960
partisan zero minus one right one is the

464
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,400
super fastest

465
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,919
am right yeah because you just give me a

466
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,760
number i just do some mess

467
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,960
and that's it but this one i have to

468
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,720
iterate

469
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,159
linear number of time right you give me

470
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,240
the number a minion

471
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,039
and i need to iterate a million times

472
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,760
that's very slow compared to one right

473
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,760
does it make sense

474
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
yeah this is butter up we can also do it

475
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,320
in

476
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,480
top down but not today okay we can also

477
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,679
do this in top down

478
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,000
yeah yeah doesn't make sense

479
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,760
all right how can we do this in top down

480
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,440
all right maybe i can write it down okay

481
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,159
hop down it's crash

482
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,159
yeah calm down

483
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:28,080
come on i put a catch in there yeah

484
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:31,520
catch yeah

485
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,559
again n if n

486
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,159
equals yellow return zero right

487
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:45,039
yeah all right it could be

488
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:48,960
different number of points is zero zero

489
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:52,320
four let's do this we want to get the

490
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,440
minimum right answer equals

491
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,440
answer equals the max infinity mass

492
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,640
infinity mass and then for

493
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,480
i in uh

494
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,799
you can do this curly brace or square

495
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,880
bracket doesn't matter okay one

496
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,840
one five ten twenty five right

497
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,840
but

498
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:26,960
n smaller than zero we return

499
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,960
return a maximum of max dot

500
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,910
[Music]

501
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:45,440
f m minus i right yeah

502
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,919
and then return after

503
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,880
wait min i don't know plus one i

504
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,400
remember yeah

505
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:56,159
yeah we we use the coin let's do this

506
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:00,080
if we use the coin c well then we need i

507
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,080
right yes that's what it says

508
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,400
okay look because if it's smaller than

509
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,120
zero

510
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,080
that will return low return infinity

511
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
plus one okay

512
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,080
that's a very special case yes yeah all

513
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,120
right

514
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,400
okay answer equals

515
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,480
z infinity okay let's let it what's the

516
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,840
term complexity space complexity for

517
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,840
this one

518
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,000
sorry all right and yeah it's the same

519
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,280
as

520
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,280
it's basically the same as the

521
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,480
dynamic programming yeah okay

522
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,480
you want to do some thick boxing

523
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,880
oh we're done okay i pulled it out oh

524
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,440
okay wait for the toothpick fairy okay

525
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,840
bye bye see you tomorrow

526
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,840
