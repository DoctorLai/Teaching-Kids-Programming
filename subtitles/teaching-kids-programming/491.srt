1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
hello mystery mr rhino all right

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,839
yeah right and what's your favorite

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,880
fruit

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,840
bananas okay maybe i also like apples

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,120
okay i post bananas and grapes also

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,559
oranges

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,279
berries as well

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,520
okay i like cat and oranges oh yeah i

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,320
like fast too okay look there are

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,279
numbers we have pairs of apples bananas

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,199
six bananas you know papaya pail banana

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,800
yeah six bananas here four bananas three

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,000
bananas yeah

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,399
those are just

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,399
balls

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,399
whatever

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,800
what what's that

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,680
my favorite my favorite okay six six

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,680
actors forever three actors you can eat

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,840
our apples okay oh bananas are apples

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,559
there are six apples forever three

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,320
apples you can eat our apples in an hour

23
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,960
if this pie if a pile contains less than

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,119
r apples you still need to take

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,040
take one hour to finish it

26
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,840
so basically for example if there are

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,920
six apples you can eat the seven apples

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,240
in one hour there are six apples here

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
and then you can eat seven apples in one

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,960
hour

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,600
but it means that when you find six

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,080
apples in an hour you do nothing it

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,960
still takes you one hour to complete the

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,280
first

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,000
so that's why i'm playing games yeah you

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,880
if you can eat the ar apples at the time

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,079
and an hour you still take you one hour

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,479
but if you eat two apples at one hour it

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,000
needs to take you two hours all right

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,399
yeah because therefore apples and you

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,600
eat two in an hour you can do that

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,439
possible okay it will be so easy

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
hypothetically okay

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,920
okay so now question is that we want to

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,399
find out okay so let's say you want to

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
find out the minimum number of r your

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,799
speed that's the speed

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,920
that given that you can finish the all

49
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,319
the apples in k hours right hours okay

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,120
so look k equals five here right coming

51
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,959
back to this theta here k equals five

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,200
hours we want to finish all these three

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,000
apples three pies of apples in five

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,120
hours so what's the minimum speed what's

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,520
the minimum

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,680
the minimum speed is the answer is three

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,760
i equal three when i equals three means

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,840
that you can easily address in one hour

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,800
so how many hours does it need to take

60
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,800
to finish the effort of six two two okay

61
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,920
i can eat for your first in one hour how

62
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,560
many hours

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,560
two two

64
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,360
how many hours one what so two plus two

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,400
plus one smaller or equal than k equals

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,200
time

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,680
okay

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,840
when r equals two can we do it so when i

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,120
equals two what happened how many hours

70
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,840
we need to finish the apple of six

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,120
two three how many hours

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,120
two how many hours

73
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,800
3 plus 2 plus 2

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,599
7

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,640
bigger than k which is not what we want

76
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,920
make sense

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,040
yep

78
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,640
so look if we have a bigger r if i can

79
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,879
finish all the apples in k hours using r

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,519
so if i give you this so how about r

81
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,319
plus one can we also finish with r plus

82
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,720
one the speed

83
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,280
my speed is i plus three

84
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,440
when r equals three we just verify that

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,120
i equal 3 we can finish only three parts

86
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,760
of apples in

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,200
five hours k equals five if r equals

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,640
four can we finish all the apples in

89
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:49,519
less than or equal in five hours

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,959
yes or no if i can eat more apples

91
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,280
in one hour

92
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,159
so the total time

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,200
taken to finish all the efforts will be

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,640
equal or less am right make sense yeah

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,680
so look the speed r is increasing

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,840
the total time will be equal or less

97
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,680
right

98
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,000
how do we solve this problem we want to

99
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,799
minimize r

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,760
so let's take total time taken

101
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,759
to

102
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,320
finish all the effort is smaller or

103
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,000
equal than k

104
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,440
we want to find the minimum r so that

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,680
the total time

106
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,400
is smaller or equal than k

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,919
the apples in one pie is

108
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,320
n and now our speed is r how many hours

109
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,160
needs to complete the highest of another

110
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,199
and y by r

111
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,440
very close and divided by r

112
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,080
but look this might be a fraction eight

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,720
apples the speed is three acres in one

114
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,520
hour how many hours do we need divide

115
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,680
eighty minus three the ceiling when i'm

116
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,360
ceiling look eight divided by three this

117
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,800
is not enough right it's two point

118
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,320
something but we want the ceiling

119
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
ceiling

120
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,840
ceiling this is ceiling look sitting

121
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,080
sitting yeah this is flaw yeah

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,080
what's this eight divided by three four

123
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,360
what is it two okay

124
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,960
silly signal means that the next integer

125
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,199
that is bigger than the current value

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,080
okay

127
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:21,120
2.01 ceiling what's the value

128
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,199
three three exactly and two point ninety

129
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,720
nine nine flaw what's the value t is

130
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,039
it's ceiling

131
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,479
and divided by r okay we want to find

132
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,919
out the sum

133
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,240
sum of it

134
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,039
this is somewhere yeah we know some of

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,840
it

136
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,680
n

137
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,199
divided by r

138
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,039
for n

139
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,639
in all the

140
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,880
priors yeah you know all the players

141
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,520
okay given the r we know how many hours

142
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,600
in total it takes to finish all the

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,520
apples we can proof us

144
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,800
i'm right what's the range of the

145
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,919
numbers we need to check what's the

146
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,880
range of r so we have a pile of apples

147
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,039
so we want to check the speed of r

148
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,240
how many acres can you eat the minimum

149
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,280
in one hour

150
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,240
do we need to check zero

151
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,479
one

152
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,080
small is very one yeah obviously yeah

153
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,080
you can eat up one airport right what's

154
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,319
the biggest number we need to check so

155
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,120
that there are piles of apples what's

156
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,160
the biggest number of r we need to check

157
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,759
look at it from here okay seven eight

158
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,360
six five what's the biggest number of ah

159
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,120
we need to check

160
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,280
yes eight

161
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,800
yeah hey where do you know it yeah so we

162
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,520
just have to check one two three four

163
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,600
five here eight right

164
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,039
am right so we check

165
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,759
which way we check we're checking from

166
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,919
one to to a or we're checking from a to

167
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,680
one we want to find the minimum so which

168
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,599
way we need to check from one to eight

169
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,000
or eight to one

170
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,440
i won't do it why is that

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,039
so the first number you get

172
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,199
is the minimum excellent okay so we can

173
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,199
prove obviously okay coming back to the

174
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,280
sentence i equals two

175
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,840
we can finish in k hours

176
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,319
so do you need to verify if we eat more

177
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,919
apples in an hour

178
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,000
can we achieve the target with the

179
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,840
bigger r

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,720
yeah obviously right i'm telling you

181
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,360
that i can finish all the apples in k

182
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,800
hours which when i eat two when my speed

183
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,560
is two apples in one hour right if i

184
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,840
increase in my speed if i'm eating three

185
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,160
apples

186
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,759
certainly i can finish it right if i'm

187
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,280
hitting 100

188
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,199
i can finish it

189
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:40,560
what does that imply when x increases

190
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:44,000
as x this is the function increases

191
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,240
or decreases we call it monotone

192
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,720
monotone increasing or molecular

193
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,919
decreasing so what accurate comes into

194
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,319
your mind if

195
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,599
x increasing and f x

196
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,560
increasing or decreasing the x this is x

197
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,800
look

198
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:04,720
when x increases the y increases

199
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,240
or when x increases the y decreases

200
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,319
monotonous

201
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,080
right so look if i'm telling you x 1

202
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:15,199
smaller than x 2 then i know f x one is

203
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,800
smaller than f x two which accurate to

204
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,080
shorten the time to

205
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,520
o

206
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,280
log n

207
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,879
what does that imply

208
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,479
when we talk about complexity what kind

209
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,479
of aggregate gives the o log n

210
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,440
so we can manually research this let's

211
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,200
define a function f r the speed is r and

212
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,120
this function returns number of hours

213
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,919
taken to finish all the players okay so

214
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,839
we have this input prior and we want to

215
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:45,760
finish all the peppers in k hours answer

216
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,839
equals zero and then for i in

217
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,800
piles right then

218
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,880
answer plus equals the ceiling yeah we

219
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,880
have this ceiling ceiling

220
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,440
i divided by

221
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,360
r right and then return answer this is

222
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,560
the function to compute the total number

223
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,120
of hours to finish with all the apples

224
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,600
all the tiles of apples

225
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,800
when the speed is up right so look these

226
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,240
can be simplified as return sum

227
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,320
sieving

228
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,200
i divided by r

229
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,120
for

230
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,880
i in pi sorry if this is shorter ceiling

231
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,480
i divided by r is also equal to i minus

232
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,480
1

233
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,519
divided by double division which is the

234
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,279
integer part divided by r plus one okay

235
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,080
this is the same thing then once we have

236
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:38,720
this rule first for

237
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,640
r in range the smallest is

238
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,440
one the biggest

239
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,120
m equals maximum of all pi m plus one

240
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,720
and then if

241
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,440
f r e smaller or equal than k right then

242
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,320
we return right this problem might seem

243
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,640
complicated but the code is very simple

244
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,959
you see look it's releases blue force

245
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,920
the time complexity look

246
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,880
here

247
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,160
m

248
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,480
and here they are p tiles okay and then

249
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,640
we need to iterate m so the times this

250
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,600
is o m t

251
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,680
right

252
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,720
we changing this we want to improve this

253
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,120
bit this is slow right we are iterating

254
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,200
from one in the worst case this

255
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,440
iteration will takes uh

256
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,519
m times one to m

257
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,320
and every iteration we need to check

258
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,120
this

259
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,399
computer total number of hours taken so

260
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,880
om times p left boundary equals one the

261
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,959
right boundary equals

262
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,920
the right boundary equals this angle

263
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,440
right so why are that's smaller than

264
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,360
equal than the right boundary and we

265
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,480
kind of mean the meter

266
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,920
so that then lowercase meter equals left

267
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,399
plus r

268
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,320
divided by two right divided by two or

269
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:59,200
you can do this left plus y shift shift

270
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,519
one this is the same then look if s m

271
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,920
smaller or equal than

272
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,680
k hours okay look

273
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,440
left right

274
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,200
meter i can finish all the apples in

275
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,760
k hours

276
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,560
okay so which way i should go left or

277
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,519
right

278
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
left

279
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,760
left way down so we want to move to the

280
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
right that's it so the right needs to

281
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,880
move to the middle yeah right r equals

282
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,519
meter minus one if look in the middle we

283
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,040
can't finish so which way we need to go

284
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,240
l equals

285
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,079
m

286
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,399
plus one well

287
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,920
l equals m plus one because look m is

288
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,320
too small we need to go to the right

289
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,560
right and then we turn

290
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,839
yeah okay the terms of negative

291
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,360
log

292
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,560
n

293
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,040
times p

294
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,440
okay o log m times p

295
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,240
this is final search sometimes you write

296
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,120
the slightly different you can say wire

297
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,920
air is smaller strictly smaller than r

298
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,000
right this is the same then

299
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,360
r

300
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
equals

301
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,480
meat and then as

302
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,240
l equals m plus one some some people

303
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,720
prefer this way you know using the

304
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,560
strictly small and then

305
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,600
you have to be very careful when dealing

306
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,720
with the boundary this is just i equals

307
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,720
meter instead of meter minus one and air

308
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,639
equals mid plus one is the same what's

309
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,040
the thing you learned today

310
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,800
about eating bananas

311
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,200
no no no we're not we are not learning

312
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,279
how to eat bananas we don't have bananas

313
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,760
here and how you don't need to learn how

314
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,639
to eat banana it's just purely skin

315
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,639
eating how to

316
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,320
imaginary empire so we are given a pie a

317
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,639
few piles of bananas let me see how many

318
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,160
do you see in k hours

319
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,720
we want to find out the minimum number

320
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,440
of ah the speed so that we can finish

321
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,360
all the piles of the apples or bananas

322
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
in k hours we want to find out the

323
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,560
minimum so we can proof us yeah we can

324
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,200
prove us from one two three four as long

325
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,839
as we we know how to compute the total

326
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,839
number of the hours taken to finish all

327
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,680
the bananas right

328
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,399
so that's the f function we check from

329
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,760
one two three and we retain it as long

330
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,800
as we can finish all the apples and

331
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,519
bananas within k hours another way of

332
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,079
improvement is to use the binary search

333
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,120
based on the fact that if we can finish

334
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,760
all the apple's bananas we see

335
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,160
chaos using the speed r and definitely

336
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,120
if we increase the speed of r we can

337
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,519
also achieve this right yeah make sense

338
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,360
yeah so we're using the final result

339
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,920
yeah and then the time complexity will

340
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,519
be improved to o log m yeah because this

341
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,000
is the space of the r search space of r

342
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,920
and we lock it right so it's a great

343
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,360
improvement times p p is necessary

344
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,480
because they take we all for each r

345
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,639
we check

346
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,399
we need to compute the number of

347
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,380
hours taken to finish all the uh efforts

348
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,480
okay that's it for today bye

349
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,480
