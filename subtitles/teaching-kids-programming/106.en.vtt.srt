1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,990

hello hello mr how are you today

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
hello hello mr how are you today
 

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,990
hello hello mr how are you today
good okay so today we talk about a

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
good okay so today we talk about a
 

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,509
good okay so today we talk about a
program how do you multiply two integers

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
program how do you multiply two integers
 

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,789
program how do you multiply two integers
numbers yeah can you write the function

8
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:12,799
numbers yeah can you write the function
 

9
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:13,270
numbers yeah can you write the function
to

10
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,280
to
 

11
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,630
to
multiply two integers very simple i i i

12
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
multiply two integers very simple i i i
 

13
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,070
multiply two integers very simple i i i
write the top for you

14
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
write the top for you
 

15
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,510
write the top for you
define multiply simple

16
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
define multiply simple
 

17
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,230
define multiply simple
yeah yeah a and two integer a b what's

18
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
yeah yeah a and two integer a b what's
 

19
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,950
yeah yeah a and two integer a b what's
missing

20
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
missing
 

21
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,830
missing
column okay and then what can you write

22
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
column okay and then what can you write
 

23
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:37,430
column okay and then what can you write
it

24
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440

 

25
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,510

it looks very strong okay how about i

26
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
it looks very strong okay how about i
 

27
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,630
it looks very strong okay how about i
tell you

28
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
tell you
 

29
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,069
tell you
i tell you you can't use hand

30
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
i tell you you can't use hand
 

31
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,990
i tell you you can't use hand
multiply and you can use the multiply

32
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
multiply and you can use the multiply
 

33
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,229
multiply and you can use the multiply
and you can't use the division

34
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
and you can't use the division
 

35
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,990
and you can't use the division
and you can't use any bit shifting which

36
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
and you can't use any bit shifting which
 

37
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,990
and you can't use any bit shifting which
may not be for me you know the brief

38
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
may not be for me you know the brief
 

39
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,990
may not be for me you know the brief
shifting we'll talk about that later

40
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
shifting we'll talk about that later
 

41
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,189
shifting we'll talk about that later
okay so can you figure a way to do it to

42
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
okay so can you figure a way to do it to
 

43
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,029
okay so can you figure a way to do it to
implement this function without using

44
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
implement this function without using
 

45
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,310
implement this function without using
these two

46
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
these two
 

47
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,230
these two
and b shifting like r and

48
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
and b shifting like r and
 

49
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,390
and b shifting like r and
shift shift left shift shift right okay

50
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
shift shift left shift shift right okay
 

51
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,190
shift shift left shift shift right okay
so you can't use any of these can you

52
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
so you can't use any of these can you
 

53
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,030
so you can't use any of these can you
figure away how how can we write it

54
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040

 

55
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,310

so for example given three times five

56
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
so for example given three times five
 

57
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,310
so for example given three times five
how do you calculate three times five if

58
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
how do you calculate three times five if
 

59
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,910
how do you calculate three times five if
i don't want you to use the multiple

60
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
i don't want you to use the multiple
 

61
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,830
i don't want you to use the multiple
how do you 5 5

62
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
how do you 5 5
 

63
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,910
how do you 5 5
well done that's the good shot yeah so

64
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
well done that's the good shot yeah so
 

65
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,190
well done that's the good shot yeah so
basically we turn

66
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
basically we turn
 

67
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,190
basically we turn
10 in the multiplier multiplication into

68
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
10 in the multiplier multiplication into
 

69
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,190
10 in the multiplier multiplication into
you can do it three times five yeah

70
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
you can do it three times five yeah
 

71
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,109
you can do it three times five yeah
or five times three all right

72
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
or five times three all right
 

73
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,149
or five times three all right
yes so which which way you think it's

74
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
yes so which which way you think it's
 

75
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,789
yes so which which way you think it's
the most

76
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
the most
 

77
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,910
the most
efficient way why is that

78
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
efficient way why is that
 

79
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,030
efficient way why is that
because it's more short it's shorter so

80
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
because it's more short it's shorter so
 

81
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,389
because it's more short it's shorter so
it involves less

82
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
it involves less
 

83
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,389
it involves less
operation right yeah yeah okay that's

84
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
operation right yeah yeah okay that's
 

85
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,870
operation right yeah yeah okay that's
good good okay how about the negative

86
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
good good okay how about the negative
 

87
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,789
good good okay how about the negative
numbers

88
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
numbers
 

89
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,389
numbers
negative numbers like how to return

90
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
negative numbers like how to return
 

91
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,470
negative numbers like how to return
how do you handle these negative numbers

92
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
how do you handle these negative numbers
 

93
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,430
how do you handle these negative numbers
like multiply minus three times five

94
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
like multiply minus three times five
 

95
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,949
like multiply minus three times five
minus three times minus five

96
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
minus three times minus five
 

97
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,229
minus three times minus five
yeah and then if there's zeros for

98
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
yeah and then if there's zeros for
 

99
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,430
yeah and then if there's zeros for
example like three times

100
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
example like three times
 

101
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,710
example like three times
zero so i'm definitely zero

102
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
zero so i'm definitely zero
 

103
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,589
zero so i'm definitely zero
yeah i know so so how do we implement

104
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
yeah i know so so how do we implement
 

105
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,150
yeah i know so so how do we implement
this

106
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
this
 

107
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,110
this
e if they're negative what do we do

108
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120

 

109
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,710

if the negative uh

110
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
if the negative uh
 

111
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,509
if the negative uh
is too negative do we just turn into a

112
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
is too negative do we just turn into a
 

113
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,229
is too negative do we just turn into a
positive

114
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
positive
 

115
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,309
positive
we're down yeah two negative ten into

116
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
we're down yeah two negative ten into
 

117
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,949
we're down yeah two negative ten into
the positive how about one negative

118
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
the positive how about one negative
 

119
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,470
the positive how about one negative
what are we doing one negative

120
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
what are we doing one negative
 

121
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,270
what are we doing one negative
one negative so minus three times my

122
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
one negative so minus three times my
 

123
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,110
one negative so minus three times my
times five equals one

124
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
times five equals one
 

125
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,229
times five equals one
minus three times five

126
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
minus three times five
 

127
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,070
minus three times five
uh minus fifteen yeah minus fifteen so

128
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
uh minus fifteen yeah minus fifteen so
 

129
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,509
uh minus fifteen yeah minus fifteen so
how do we do it if it's

130
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
how do we do it if it's
 

131
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,710
how do we do it if it's
minus then we take a minus away and then

132
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
minus then we take a minus away and then
 

133
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,830
minus then we take a minus away and then
we

134
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
we
 

135
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,750
we
check this and put the minus okay so

136
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
check this and put the minus okay so
 

137
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,309
check this and put the minus okay so
so let's write it okay so easy look it

138
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
so let's write it okay so easy look it
 

139
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,830
so let's write it okay so easy look it
should be very easy

140
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
should be very easy
 

141
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,949
should be very easy
so look if a equals

142
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
so look if a equals
 

143
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,550
so look if a equals
zero or b equals zero

144
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
zero or b equals zero
 

145
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,309
zero or b equals zero
return one

146
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319

 

147
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,270

zero if a smaller than zero

148
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
zero if a smaller than zero
 

149
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,030
zero if a smaller than zero
and p smaller than zero what's

150
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
and p smaller than zero what's
 

151
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,470
and p smaller than zero what's
what should we return return

152
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
what should we return return
 

153
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,350
what should we return return
return let's call itself yeah let's turn

154
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
return let's call itself yeah let's turn
 

155
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,990
return let's call itself yeah let's turn
this

156
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
this
 

157
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,110
this
negative into positive which is

158
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
negative into positive which is
 

159
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,830
negative into positive which is
return multiple y can you feel this

160
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
return multiple y can you feel this
 

161
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,470
return multiple y can you feel this
blank

162
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
blank
 

163
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,830
blank
two two things uh

164
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
two two things uh
 

165
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,910
two two things uh
turning to positive yeah how can we turn

166
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
turning to positive yeah how can we turn
 

167
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,949
turning to positive yeah how can we turn
it to

168
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
it to
 

169
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,789
it to
a is negative now how can we turn into

170
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
a is negative now how can we turn into
 

171
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,110
a is negative now how can we turn into
positive

172
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
positive
 

173
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,229
positive
a is already negative how can we make we

174
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
a is already negative how can we make we
 

175
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,229
a is already negative how can we make we
how can we turn a into plus a

176
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
how can we turn a into plus a
 

177
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,229
how can we turn a into plus a
negative weight

178
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239

 

179
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,509

minus what a yeah minus a and

180
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
minus what a yeah minus a and
 

181
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,789
minus what a yeah minus a and
here minus b yeah minus b

182
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
here minus b yeah minus b
 

183
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,670
here minus b yeah minus b
minus b minus b okay be confident okay

184
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
minus b minus b okay be confident okay
 

185
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,390
minus b minus b okay be confident okay
yeah okay then look if i if one of them

186
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
yeah okay then look if i if one of them
 

187
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,030
yeah okay then look if i if one of them
is

188
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
is
 

189
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,749
is
negative if a is smaller than zero b

190
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
negative if a is smaller than zero b
 

191
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,870
negative if a is smaller than zero b
smaller than zero

192
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
smaller than zero
 

193
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,270
smaller than zero
can you tell me what to put here what

194
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280

 

195
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,350

this is n we can't do that

196
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
this is n we can't do that
 

197
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,830
this is n we can't do that
we can use the not the end this is this

198
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
we can use the not the end this is this
 

199
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,070
we can use the not the end this is this
is logical and not the big shifting

200
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
is logical and not the big shifting
 

201
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,629
is logical and not the big shifting
you can use this so if a is smaller than

202
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
you can use this so if a is smaller than
 

203
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,189
you can use this so if a is smaller than
zero

204
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
zero
 

205
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,230
zero
what this this we checking if both

206
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
what this this we checking if both
 

207
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,990
what this this we checking if both
are zero and if n is one

208
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
are zero and if n is one
 

209
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,950
are zero and if n is one
both are not yellow right yeah and both

210
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
both are not yellow right yeah and both
 

211
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,150
both are not yellow right yeah and both
are not yellow

212
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
are not yellow
 

213
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,510
are not yellow
if what's your equation here

214
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
if what's your equation here
 

215
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,070
if what's your equation here
if one of them is zero should we use n

216
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
if one of them is zero should we use n
 

217
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,270
if one of them is zero should we use n
or or

218
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280

 

219
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,110

if one room is zero what should i put

220
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
if one room is zero what should i put
 

221
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,310
if one room is zero what should i put
here

222
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
here
 

223
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,590
here
oh yes if one or one zero but we need to

224
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
oh yes if one or one zero but we need to
 

225
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,310
oh yes if one or one zero but we need to
check

226
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
check
 

227
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,390
check
which one is zero so you pretend if a is

228
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
which one is zero so you pretend if a is
 

229
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,469
which one is zero so you pretend if a is
smaller than zero then wha

230
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
smaller than zero then wha
 

231
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,310
smaller than zero then wha
return one if a smaller than zero is b

232
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
return one if a smaller than zero is b
 

233
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,790
return one if a smaller than zero is b
smaller than zero in this case it's p

234
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
smaller than zero in this case it's p
 

235
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,510
smaller than zero in this case it's p
small now

236
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
small now
 

237
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,270
small now
because if this if a is smaller than

238
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
because if this if a is smaller than
 

239
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,590
because if this if a is smaller than
zero piece more than zero is here yeah

240
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
zero piece more than zero is here yeah
 

241
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,590
zero piece more than zero is here yeah
if a smaller than zero return multiply

242
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
if a smaller than zero return multiply
 

243
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,430
if a smaller than zero return multiply
what what return multiply

244
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
what what return multiply
 

245
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,350
what what return multiply
a base one and

246
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
a base one and
 

247
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,390
a base one and
b yeah okay we're done if b is smaller

248
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
b yeah okay we're done if b is smaller
 

249
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,430
b yeah okay we're done if b is smaller
than zero

250
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
than zero
 

251
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,070
than zero
yeah return y multiply multiply

252
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
yeah return y multiply multiply
 

253
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,070
yeah return y multiply multiply
minus b is smaller than zero a is

254
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
minus b is smaller than zero a is
 

255
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,550
minus b is smaller than zero a is
smaller than the other no no

256
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560

 

257
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,629

minus b well done yes okay so this is

258
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
minus b well done yes okay so this is
 

259
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,150
minus b well done yes okay so this is
b basically these are the cases

260
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
b basically these are the cases
 

261
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,870
b basically these are the cases
yeah these are the cases to turn

262
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
yeah these are the cases to turn
 

263
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,350
yeah these are the cases to turn
everything into positive because we are

264
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
everything into positive because we are
 

265
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,390
everything into positive because we are
focusing on handling the positive

266
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
focusing on handling the positive
 

267
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,550
focusing on handling the positive
multiplication for two numbers yes yes

268
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
multiplication for two numbers yes yes
 

269
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,710
multiplication for two numbers yes yes
if any of them is zero we don't care if

270
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
if any of them is zero we don't care if
 

271
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,309
if any of them is zero we don't care if
any of them is negative

272
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
any of them is negative
 

273
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,909
any of them is negative
our pulse of light are negative we don't

274
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
our pulse of light are negative we don't
 

275
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,070
our pulse of light are negative we don't
care because we we have these four ifs

276
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
care because we we have these four ifs
 

277
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,790
care because we we have these four ifs
to turn

278
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
to turn
 

279
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,550
to turn
everything into positive okay yeah

280
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
everything into positive okay yeah
 

281
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,990
everything into positive okay yeah
turn everything into positive positive a

282
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
turn everything into positive positive a
 

283
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,830
turn everything into positive positive a
positive okay so now positive how can we

284
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
positive okay so now positive how can we
 

285
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,430
positive okay so now positive how can we
do it

286
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
do it
 

287
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,550
do it
and look if

288
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
and look if
 

289
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,670
and look if
a is smaller than b

290
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
a is smaller than b
 

291
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,950
a is smaller than b
okay so we want to look we want to turn

292
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
okay so we want to look we want to turn
 

293
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,070
okay so we want to look we want to turn
3 times 5 into

294
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
3 times 5 into
 

295
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,110
3 times 5 into
no we want to 10 five times three

296
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
no we want to 10 five times three
 

297
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,510
no we want to 10 five times three
into three times five right why

298
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
into three times five right why
 

299
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,990
into three times five right why
so instead of three plus three plus

300
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
so instead of three plus three plus
 

301
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,909
so instead of three plus three plus
three plus three plus three

302
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
three plus three plus three
 

303
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,230
three plus three plus three
we want the five plus five plus five

304
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
we want the five plus five plus five
 

305
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,270
we want the five plus five plus five
okay yeah

306
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
okay yeah
 

307
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,390
okay yeah
okay so suppose this is a this is b so

308
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
okay so suppose this is a this is b so
 

309
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,589
okay so suppose this is a this is b so
if a is bigger than b

310
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
if a is bigger than b
 

311
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,629
if a is bigger than b
then return y return

312
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
then return y return
 

313
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,990
then return y return
multiply what

314
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000

 

315
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,629

yes and now now we are falling at these

316
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
yes and now now we are falling at these
 

317
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,510
yes and now now we are falling at these
cases

318
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
cases
 

319
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,950
cases
so a is three b is five

320
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
so a is three b is five
 

321
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,270
so a is three b is five
so how can we do it how can we write it

322
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
so how can we do it how can we write it
 

323
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,589
so how can we do it how can we write it
uh okay we can return return what

324
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599

 

325
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,629

so five times five times five yeah so we

326
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
so five times five times five yeah so we
 

327
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,189
so five times five times five yeah so we
want to

328
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
want to
 

329
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,390
want to
make i add yeah if we want to make

330
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
make i add yeah if we want to make
 

331
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,869
make i add yeah if we want to make
a smaller three times five equals

332
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
a smaller three times five equals
 

333
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,390
a smaller three times five equals
three minus one times five plus five

334
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
three minus one times five plus five
 

335
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,270
three minus one times five plus five
all right yeah yes yeah got it so how

336
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
all right yeah yes yeah got it so how
 

337
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:03,189
all right yeah yes yeah got it so how
can we write this

338
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199

 

339
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,230

a minus one times

340
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
a minus one times
 

341
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,790
a minus one times
b add b

342
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800

 

343
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,670

look we we can't use these terms so we

344
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
look we we can't use these terms so we
 

345
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,670
look we we can't use these terms so we
need to use this to multiply

346
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
need to use this to multiply
 

347
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,270
need to use this to multiply
return what multiply

348
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
return what multiply
 

349
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,670
return what multiply
multiply what this is a this is b

350
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
multiply what this is a this is b
 

351
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,670
multiply what this is a this is b
multiplication a

352
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
multiplication a
 

353
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,670
multiplication a
minus one

354
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
minus one
 

355
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,950
minus one
multiply no no it's the a and b

356
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
multiply no no it's the a and b
 

357
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,389
multiply no no it's the a and b
whatever b yeah and then add b

358
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
whatever b yeah and then add b
 

359
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,709
whatever b yeah and then add b
yeah okay we're done now let's perfect

360
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
yeah okay we're done now let's perfect
 

361
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,589
yeah okay we're done now let's perfect
okay

362
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
okay
 

363
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,310
okay
so how can we turn these if we don't

364
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
so how can we turn these if we don't
 

365
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,909
so how can we turn these if we don't
want to use this recursion

366
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
want to use this recursion
 

367
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,470
want to use this recursion
we want to do it using iterate today how

368
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
we want to do it using iterate today how
 

369
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,870
we want to do it using iterate today how
can we do this

370
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880

 

371
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,110

so we add the answer here answer equals

372
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
so we add the answer here answer equals
 

373
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,630
so we add the answer here answer equals
zero right

374
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
zero right
 

375
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,350
zero right
yes yes how can you turn this into a

376
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
yes yes how can you turn this into a
 

377
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,750
yes yes how can you turn this into a
white

378
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,590
is bigger than y where y i is
bigger than zero right yeah and what you

388
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
bigger than zero right yeah and what you
 

389
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,870
bigger than zero right yeah and what you
will do answer

390
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
will do answer
 

391
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,230
will do answer
plus equals what can you can just

392
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
plus equals what can you can just
 

393
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,110
plus equals what can you can just
do this one one no

394
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120

 

395
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:28,550

answer e plus equal one

396
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560

 

397
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,670

why a is smaller than zero a is three b

398
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
why a is smaller than zero a is three b
 

399
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,670
why a is smaller than zero a is three b
is five why a three is bigger than zero

400
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
is five why a three is bigger than zero
 

401
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,990
is five why a three is bigger than zero
we are adding the answer of one b

402
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
we are adding the answer of one b
 

403
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,110
we are adding the answer of one b
b and now we need to equal

404
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
b and now we need to equal
 

405
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,670
b and now we need to equal
that and we and we need to a what one

406
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
that and we and we need to a what one
 

407
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,230
that and we and we need to a what one
a

408
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240

become two so what we need to make it

412
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
become two so what we need to make it
 

413
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,910
become two so what we need to make it
minus equals one okay and then we turn

414
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
minus equals one okay and then we turn
 

415
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,670
minus equals one okay and then we turn
return one return one

416
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680

 

417
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,509

well done okay so

418
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
well done okay so
 

419
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,350
well done okay so
do you see it yeah yeah we we are using

420
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
do you see it yeah yeah we we are using
 

421
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,030
do you see it yeah yeah we we are using
only the plus

422
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
only the plus
 

423
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,870
only the plus
minus to deal with the

424
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
minus to deal with the
 

425
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,910
minus to deal with the
multiplication right yeah

426
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
multiplication right yeah
 

427
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,949
multiplication right yeah
okay yeah yeah so how about

428
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
okay yeah yeah so how about
 

429
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,750
okay yeah yeah so how about
as a bonus if we are allowing to use the

430
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
as a bonus if we are allowing to use the
 

431
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,790
as a bonus if we are allowing to use the
division

432
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
division
 

433
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,470
division
or shifting how do we do it

434
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
or shifting how do we do it
 

435
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,269
or shifting how do we do it
we have to use those no no no this is

436
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
we have to use those no no no this is
 

437
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,110
we have to use those no no no this is
because my original question is

438
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
because my original question is
 

439
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,710
because my original question is
don't use the time multiplier and dv

440
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
don't use the time multiplier and dv
 

441
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,430
don't use the time multiplier and dv
divide and bit shifting which is to the

442
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
divide and bit shifting which is to the
 

443
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,310
divide and bit shifting which is to the
left to the right

444
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
left to the right
 

445
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,829
left to the right
but to the left to the right is

446
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
but to the left to the right is
 

447
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,150
but to the left to the right is
basically

448
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
basically
 

449
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,430
basically
to the left is basically multiply two

450
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
to the left is basically multiply two
 

451
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,670
to the left is basically multiply two
to the right is basically divided by two

452
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
to the right is basically divided by two
 

453
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,430
to the right is basically divided by two
yeah got it because

454
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
yeah got it because
 

455
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,430
yeah got it because
because look uh one basis in binary is

456
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
because look uh one basis in binary is
 

457
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,230
because look uh one basis in binary is
a yeah if you if you get rid of zero

458
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
a yeah if you if you get rid of zero
 

459
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,990
a yeah if you if you get rid of zero
that counts four yeah shifting to the

460
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
that counts four yeah shifting to the
 

461
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,990
that counts four yeah shifting to the
right if you add one more zero

462
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
right if you add one more zero
 

463
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,269
right if you add one more zero
it becomes 16 yeah okay

464
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
it becomes 16 yeah okay
 

465
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,430
it becomes 16 yeah okay
yeah okay so if we are allow using this

466
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
yeah okay so if we are allow using this
 

467
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,509
yeah okay so if we are allow using this
any thoughts like three times five how

468
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
any thoughts like three times five how
 

469
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,230
any thoughts like three times five how
can we do it three times five

470
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
can we do it three times five
 

471
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,829
can we do it three times five
equals one equals one

472
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
equals one equals one
 

473
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,110
equals one equals one
five equals fifteen yeah i know

474
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120

 

475
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,509

five that's fine maybe a little bit yeah

476
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
five that's fine maybe a little bit yeah
 

477
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,350
five that's fine maybe a little bit yeah
yeah maybe a little bit

478
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360

 

479
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,509

maybe look maybe what six times five

480
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
maybe look maybe what six times five
 

481
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,230
maybe look maybe what six times five
equals one yeah i know but five and five

482
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,240
equals one yeah i know but five and five
 

483
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,710
equals one yeah i know but five and five
guys

484
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720

 

485
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,630

no no maybe maybe six times seven okay

486
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
no no maybe maybe six times seven okay
 

487
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,910
no no maybe maybe six times seven okay
how hot do we do this is

488
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
how hot do we do this is
 

489
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,110
how hot do we do this is
a this is b instead of adding

490
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
a this is b instead of adding
 

491
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,670
a this is b instead of adding
instead of adding six times of seven

492
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
instead of adding six times of seven
 

493
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,069
instead of adding six times of seven
seven plus seven plus seven plus seven

494
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
seven plus seven plus seven plus seven
 

495
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,750
seven plus seven plus seven plus seven
seven e we can do this we can ten

496
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:54,760
seven e we can do this we can ten
 

497
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,910
seven e we can do this we can ten
because

498
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920

 

499
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,790

and multiply this by two so that will

500
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
and multiply this by two so that will
 

501
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,670
and multiply this by two so that will
become

502
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
become
 

503
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,110
become
low becomes 12 times for uh 40 i know

504
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
low becomes 12 times for uh 40 i know
 

505
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,750
low becomes 12 times for uh 40 i know
3 times 14 yeah yeah so that will be

506
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
3 times 14 yeah yeah so that will be
 

507
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,030
3 times 14 yeah yeah so that will be
even shorter yeah

508
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
even shorter yeah
 

509
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,069
even shorter yeah
but if it's an odd number so we we

510
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
but if it's an odd number so we we
 

511
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,910
but if it's an odd number so we we
cannot use this we can

512
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
cannot use this we can
 

513
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,870
cannot use this we can
minus one right when it's even number we

514
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
minus one right when it's even number we
 

515
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,670
minus one right when it's even number we
can

516
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
can
 

517
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,430
can
we can divide a divide a by two

518
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
we can divide a divide a by two
 

519
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,990
we can divide a divide a by two
or shifting a to the one to the right

520
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
or shifting a to the one to the right
 

521
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,710
or shifting a to the one to the right
right

522
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
right
 

523
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,069
right
and then multiply b by two or shifting b

524
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
and then multiply b by two or shifting b
 

525
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,949
and then multiply b by two or shifting b
one position to the left okay so in this

526
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
one position to the left okay so in this
 

527
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,670
one position to the left okay so in this
case it will be faster right instead of

528
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
case it will be faster right instead of
 

529
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,910
case it will be faster right instead of
what's the time complexity of reason by

530
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
what's the time complexity of reason by
 

531
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,829
what's the time complexity of reason by
the way

532
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
the way
 

533
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:49,030
the way
oh

534
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040

 

535
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,269

a because a is smaller right yeah always

536
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
a because a is smaller right yeah always
 

537
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,069
a because a is smaller right yeah always
smaller so you can

538
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
smaller so you can
 

539
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,670
smaller so you can
all o l mean a b

540
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
all o l mean a b
 

541
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,030
all o l mean a b
and because a and b could be negative so

542
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
and because a and b could be negative so
 

543
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,190
and because a and b could be negative so
you put the absolute value yeah

544
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
you put the absolute value yeah
 

545
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,750
you put the absolute value yeah
this absolute value remember abs was

546
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
this absolute value remember abs was
 

547
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,790
this absolute value remember abs was
absolutely

548
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
absolutely
 

549
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,590
absolutely
bad remember absolute minus three equals

550
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
bad remember absolute minus three equals
 

551
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,430
bad remember absolute minus three equals
three is the distance between the number

552
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
three is the distance between the number
 

553
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,069
three is the distance between the number
on the

554
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
on the
 

555
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,030
on the
line to the zero yeah in mathematics you

556
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,040
line to the zero yeah in mathematics you
 

557
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,910
line to the zero yeah in mathematics you
use this

558
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
use this
 

559
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,269
use this
two this minus three equals three

560
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
two this minus three equals three
 

561
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,629
two this minus three equals three
this three equals three so it's like two

562
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
this three equals three so it's like two
 

563
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,670
this three equals three so it's like two
vertical sticks okay okay

564
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
vertical sticks okay okay
 

565
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,670
vertical sticks okay okay
yes yeah here minimum absolute value a b

566
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
yes yeah here minimum absolute value a b
 

567
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,750
yes yeah here minimum absolute value a b
this is the complexity yeah because we

568
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
this is the complexity yeah because we
 

569
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,310
this is the complexity yeah because we
need that amount of time

570
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
need that amount of time
 

571
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,949
need that amount of time
iterations to calculate to accumulate

572
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
iterations to calculate to accumulate
 

573
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,750
iterations to calculate to accumulate
another value

574
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
another value
 

575
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,550
another value
all right yes if we are using this

576
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560
all right yes if we are using this
 

577
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,509
all right yes if we are using this
divided too

578
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
divided too
 

579
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,430
divided too
what's the complexity

580
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440

 

581
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,829

you'll be log not the thing right

582
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
you'll be log not the thing right
 

583
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,509
you'll be log not the thing right
because every time we can divide it by

584
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
because every time we can divide it by
 

585
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:47,990
because every time we can divide it by
two

586
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
two
 

587
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,910
two
yeah yeah so that would be log

588
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920

 

589
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,949

log minimum mean divided by two

590
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
log minimum mean divided by two
 

591
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,949
log minimum mean divided by two
yeah because log divided by two is the

592
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
yeah because log divided by two is the
 

593
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,470
yeah because log divided by two is the
most efficient okay

594
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
most efficient okay
 

595
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,470
most efficient okay
yeah yeah but that's a very good

596
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
yeah yeah but that's a very good
 

597
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,990
yeah yeah but that's a very good
question yeah

598
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
question yeah
 

599
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,069
question yeah
okay so that's it for today

600
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:06,079

 

601
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,910

have a nice weekend bye bye bye

602
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
have a nice weekend bye bye bye
 

603
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,040
have a nice weekend bye bye bye
yeah bye bye
