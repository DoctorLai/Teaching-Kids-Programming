00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:27,279
and how do you lie for um
 

17
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:42,950
and how do you lie for um
how do you like five

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960

 

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,549

what letters do you have i mean

20
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:47,559

 

21
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:51,029

lcdm so so this is one

22
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
lcdm so so this is one
 

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:01:01,050
lcdm so so this is one
this is five this is

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,060

 

25
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,510

[Music]

26
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
[Music]
 

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,830
[Music]
that's even better so if i give you a

28
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
that's even better so if i give you a
 

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,950
that's even better so if i give you a
number like

30
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
number like
 

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,270
number like
i don't know uh i

32
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
i don't know uh i
 

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,950
i don't know uh i
uh let's do this okay l

34
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
uh let's do this okay l
 

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,630
uh let's do this okay l
x v i what's this what's the number of

36
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
x v i what's this what's the number of
 

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,149
x v i what's this what's the number of
this air x yeah

38
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
this air x yeah
 

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,350
this air x yeah
so tell me the number

40
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360

 

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,469

that's 15. that's 10

42
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
that's 15. that's 10
 

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,950
that's 15. that's 10
that's five that's one 66

44
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
that's five that's one 66
 

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,429
that's five that's one 66
wow you got it you nailed it okay how

46
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
wow you got it you nailed it okay how
 

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,550
wow you got it you nailed it okay how
about i nail

48
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
about i nail
 

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,630
about i nail
it yeah you nearly how about x

50
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
it yeah you nearly how about x
 

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,910
it yeah you nearly how about x
er

52
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920

 

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,270

40 so that's 10

54
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
40 so that's 10
 

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,630
40 so that's 10
let's 50 why this is 40 oh because the

56
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
let's 50 why this is 40 oh because the
 

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,749
let's 50 why this is 40 oh because the
smaller number is fast smaller so this

58
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
smaller number is fast smaller so this
 

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,830
smaller number is fast smaller so this
is will become

60
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
is will become
 

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,469
is will become
eventually you become minus 10 plus 50.

62
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
eventually you become minus 10 plus 50.
 

63
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,630
eventually you become minus 10 plus 50.
if the next one is smaller than the

64
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
if the next one is smaller than the
 

65
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,070
if the next one is smaller than the
current one we just add it

66
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
current one we just add it
 

67
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,350
current one we just add it
right and add i use the bigger if the

68
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
right and add i use the bigger if the
 

69
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,390
right and add i use the bigger if the
next one is bigger

70
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
next one is bigger
 

71
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,150
next one is bigger
so this one is the smaller one which is

72
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
so this one is the smaller one which is
 

73
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,550
so this one is the smaller one which is
two minus okay so today's job is very

74
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
two minus okay so today's job is very
 

75
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,990
two minus okay so today's job is very
simple given a

76
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
simple given a
 

77
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,110
simple given a
roman number tell me

78
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120

 

79
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,270

how how many it represents what's that

80
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
how how many it represents what's that
 

81
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,030
how how many it represents what's that
number you represent okay

82
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040

 

83
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,150

so so what's your approach

84
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
so so what's your approach
 

85
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,830
so so what's your approach
we just solve it you already know how to

86
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
we just solve it you already know how to
 

87
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,990
we just solve it you already know how to
do it so tell me the approach

88
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
do it so tell me the approach
 

89
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,350
do it so tell me the approach
you're solving this given under this and

90
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
you're solving this given under this and
 

91
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,550
you're solving this given under this and
it'll be much easier

92
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
it'll be much easier
 

93
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,309
it'll be much easier
yeah yeah we have suppose we have a

94
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
yeah yeah we have suppose we have a
 

95
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,070
yeah yeah we have suppose we have a
mapping table so

96
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
mapping table so
 

97
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,830
mapping table so
we store this mapping table in uh

98
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:49,840
we store this mapping table in uh
 

99
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,110
we store this mapping table in uh
set a hash map a notebook yeah we can

100
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
set a hash map a notebook yeah we can
 

101
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,910
set a hash map a notebook yeah we can
look it up

102
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
look it up
 

103
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,830
look it up
looking up the keys will be least

104
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
looking up the keys will be least
 

105
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,830
looking up the keys will be least
character the values will be the

106
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
character the values will be the
 

107
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,470
character the values will be the
numbers yeah so we can look it up yeah

108
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
numbers yeah so we can look it up yeah
 

109
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,070
numbers yeah so we can look it up yeah
okay so look

110
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
okay so look
 

111
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,830
okay so look
we go through this number and how hard

112
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
we go through this number and how hard
 

113
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,070
we go through this number and how hard
are we going if the next one is smaller

114
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
are we going if the next one is smaller
 

115
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,509
are we going if the next one is smaller
than

116
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
than
 

117
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,949
than
if the next one is smaller than the

118
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
if the next one is smaller than the
 

119
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,190
if the next one is smaller than the
current one right by looking at the

120
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
current one right by looking at the
 

121
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,309
current one right by looking at the
least we added 15 10

122
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
least we added 15 10
 

123
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,710
least we added 15 10
5 and the last one if if this one

124
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
5 and the last one if if this one
 

125
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,830
5 and the last one if if this one
is smaller than the next one

126
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
is smaller than the next one
 

127
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,070
is smaller than the next one
what we do we put a

128
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
what we do we put a
 

129
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,750
what we do we put a
so for this one xl so if this if x

130
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
so for this one xl so if this if x
 

131
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,869
so for this one xl so if this if x
is smaller than the next one right if

132
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
is smaller than the next one right if
 

133
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,430
is smaller than the next one right if
this

134
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
this
 

135
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,869
this
the current character is smaller than

136
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
the current character is smaller than
 

137
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,710
the current character is smaller than
the next one what should we do

138
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
the next one what should we do
 

139
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,149
the next one what should we do
how should we do it differently than

140
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
how should we do it differently than
 

141
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,149
how should we do it differently than
this one um

142
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
this one um
 

143
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,470
this one um
because because the smaller number is

144
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
because because the smaller number is
 

145
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,430
because because the smaller number is
first

146
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
first
 

147
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,509
first
yeah and then we subtract this number

148
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
yeah and then we subtract this number
 

149
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:47,990
yeah and then we subtract this number
right

150
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
right
 

151
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,470
right
and go through that okay that's easy

152
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
and go through that okay that's easy
 

153
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,430
and go through that okay that's easy
that seems the easy one

154
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
that seems the easy one
 

155
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,630
that seems the easy one
there was a time complexity

156
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
there was a time complexity
 

157
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,030
there was a time complexity
if there are a number and characters in

158
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
if there are a number and characters in
 

159
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,589
if there are a number and characters in
the roman string

160
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
the roman string
 

161
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,710
the roman string
okay let's do this

162
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720

 

163
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,070

define roman

164
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
define roman
 

165
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,509
define roman
two integer okay

166
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
two integer okay
 

167
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,990
two integer okay
and now we get the s here okay

168
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
and now we get the s here okay
 

169
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,310
and now we get the s here okay
so first of all we want to keep the

170
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
so first of all we want to keep the
 

171
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,150
so first of all we want to keep the
value in the answer at the beginning is

172
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
value in the answer at the beginning is
 

173
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,189
value in the answer at the beginning is
zero right

174
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
zero right
 

175
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,270
zero right
so but we need to also need a a mapping

176
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
so but we need to also need a a mapping
 

177
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,909
so but we need to also need a a mapping
table so

178
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:27,919
table so
 

179
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,909
table so
let's do a mapping table let's call it

180
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
let's do a mapping table let's call it
 

181
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,270
let's do a mapping table let's call it
data

182
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
data
 

183
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,870
data
and how do we do the mapping table we

184
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
and how do we do the mapping table we
 

185
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,469
and how do we do the mapping table we
use the curry brace look

186
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
use the curry brace look
 

187
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,110
use the curry brace look
curly brace and then we can write i

188
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
curly brace and then we can write i
 

189
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,749
curly brace and then we can write i
i is one right comma look and

190
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
i is one right comma look and
 

191
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,030
i is one right comma look and
and v is five

192
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
and v is five
 

193
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,189
and v is five
okay except so okay i i'm not going to

194
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
okay except so okay i i'm not going to
 

195
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,790
okay except so okay i i'm not going to
write always why

196
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
write always why
 

197
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,550
write always why
i you know you know i'm going to leave

198
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
i you know you know i'm going to leave
 

199
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,310
i you know you know i'm going to leave
okay

200
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320

 

201
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,670

yeah i'm lazy just to keep it quick iv

202
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
yeah i'm lazy just to keep it quick iv
 

203
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,430
yeah i'm lazy just to keep it quick iv
what i v x

204
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
what i v x
 

205
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,430
what i v x
l c d m do you find the acronym for it

206
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
l c d m do you find the acronym for it
 

207
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,629
l c d m do you find the acronym for it
no okay

208
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639

 

209
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,510

wait wait wait wait let me think

210
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
wait wait wait wait let me think
 

211
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,189
wait wait wait wait let me think
come on wait let me think

212
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
come on wait let me think
 

213
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,670
come on wait let me think
you can tell people how to remember this

214
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680

 

215
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,670

trust me i will it will be interesting

216
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
trust me i will it will be interesting
 

217
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,430
trust me i will it will be interesting
right okay don't worry about it

218
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440

 

219
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,430

come on wait the video is funny okay

220
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
come on wait the video is funny okay
 

221
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,629
come on wait the video is funny okay
let's do this

222
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
let's do this
 

223
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,830
let's do this
and equals length and summaries the

224
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
and equals length and summaries the
 

225
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,670
and equals length and summaries the
number of characters in the string right

226
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
number of characters in the string right
 

227
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,950
number of characters in the string right
all right

228
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
all right
 

229
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,550
all right
come on okay i know we want to iterate

230
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
come on okay i know we want to iterate
 

231
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,070
come on okay i know we want to iterate
for

232
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
for
 

233
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,270
for
i in range

234
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
i in range
 

235
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,990
i in range
to to n minus one yeah we want to skip

236
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
to to n minus one yeah we want to skip
 

237
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,749
to to n minus one yeah we want to skip
the last one first because we want to

238
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
the last one first because we want to
 

239
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,670
the last one first because we want to
find out look if if current letter

240
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
find out look if if current letter
 

241
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,029
find out look if if current letter
the value will be theta all right all

242
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
the value will be theta all right all
 

243
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,950
the value will be theta all right all
right delta

244
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
right delta
 

245
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,230
right delta
s i okay you tell me okay

246
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
s i okay you tell me okay
 

247
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,670
s i okay you tell me okay
s i is the current letter yeah i think

248
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
s i is the current letter yeah i think
 

249
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,710
s i is the current letter yeah i think
and theta we're looking at the value if

250
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
and theta we're looking at the value if
 

251
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,990
and theta we're looking at the value if
it's a

252
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
it's a
 

253
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,990
it's a
bigger if it's bigger

254
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
bigger if it's bigger
 

255
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,070
bigger if it's bigger
or equal right or you think if it's

256
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
or equal right or you think if it's
 

257
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,670
or equal right or you think if it's
smaller let's say if it's smaller

258
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
smaller let's say if it's smaller
 

259
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,050
smaller let's say if it's smaller
if it's smaller than y

260
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,060

263
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,590

the next one is one what is the next one

264
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
the next one is one what is the next one
 

265
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,110
the next one is one what is the next one
because

266
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
because
 

267
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,710
because
common index is i this is the plus one

268
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
common index is i this is the plus one
 

269
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,150
common index is i this is the plus one
yes i plus one and i'm using

270
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
yes i plus one and i'm using
 

271
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,230
yes i plus one and i'm using
the theta data look it up the value here

272
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
the theta data look it up the value here
 

273
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,629
the theta data look it up the value here
like what if this is smaller than the

274
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
like what if this is smaller than the
 

275
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,230
like what if this is smaller than the
next one

276
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
next one
 

277
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,189
next one
we subtract answer one

278
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
we subtract answer one
 

279
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,870
we subtract answer one
subtract one subtract

280
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
subtract one subtract
 

281
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,430
subtract one subtract
subtract which value this this from this

282
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
subtract which value this this from this
 

283
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:25,430
subtract which value this this from this
no no no but next one

284
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440

 

285
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,070

yeah but for the next one we're going to

286
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
yeah but for the next one we're going to
 

287
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,990
yeah but for the next one we're going to
add it anyway right so we just

288
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
add it anyway right so we just
 

289
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,230
add it anyway right so we just
need to substitute data as i

290
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
need to substitute data as i
 

291
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,350
need to substitute data as i
okay i'll tell you s-i look at eric look

292
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
okay i'll tell you s-i look at eric look

iv iv i
 

295
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,070
iv iv i
is -1 now and then i if i move to the

00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
just ended
 

303
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,990
just ended
in the next iteration right and as f1

311
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,830

if it's smaller i subtract and if it's

312
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
if it's smaller i subtract and if it's
 

313
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,990
if it's smaller i subtract and if it's

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:31,110

which one is it the same

320
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120

 

321
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,149

okay so look these will

322
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
okay so look these will
 

323
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,230
okay so look these will
we'll skip the last one right skip the

324
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
we'll skip the last one right skip the
 

325
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,990
we'll skip the last one right skip the
last characters and then for the last

326
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
last characters and then for the last
 

327
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,149
last characters and then for the last
character we just need to edit right

328
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
character we just need to edit right
 

329
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,750
character we just need to edit right
so theta answer answer

330
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
so theta answer answer
 

331
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,790
so theta answer answer
plus equal theta what's the last

332
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
plus equal theta what's the last
 

333
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,910
plus equal theta what's the last

335
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,110
character
what's the last character yeah s minus

336
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
what's the last character yeah s minus
 

337
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,550
what's the last character yeah s minus
one

338
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
one
 

339
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,509
one
that's it okay look what's the tongue

340
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
that's it okay look what's the tongue
 

341
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,550
that's it okay look what's the tongue
complexity

342
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560

 

343
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,389

oh and yeah we're iterating anytime

344
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
oh and yeah we're iterating anytime
 

345
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,710
oh and yeah we're iterating anytime
what's the space complexity

346
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720

 

347
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,750

what's the space are complexity using

348
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
what's the space are complexity using
 

349
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,310
what's the space are complexity using
any space here

350
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
any space here
 

351
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,350
any space here
are we using any space here yeah but

352
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
are we using any space here yeah but
 

353
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,990
are we using any space here yeah but
this one

354
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
this one
 

355
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,190
this one
is is it growing as the number of s

356
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
is is it growing as the number of s
 

357
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,550
is is it growing as the number of s
so what's the terminology

358
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560

 

359
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,190

a one we are using a lookup table but

360
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
a one we are using a lookup table but
 

361
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,550
a one we are using a lookup table but
this doesn't change

362
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
this doesn't change
 

363
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,550
this doesn't change
these we know the fixed we know it's a

364
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
these we know the fixed we know it's a
 

365
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,230
these we know the fixed we know it's a
it's a

366
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
it's a
 

367
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,150
it's a
a table with a fixed size it's a lookup

368
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
a table with a fixed size it's a lookup
 

369
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,790
a table with a fixed size it's a lookup
table key value pair yeah notebook yeah

370
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
table key value pair yeah notebook yeah
 

371
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,230
table key value pair yeah notebook yeah
key value pair yeah okay you're still

372
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
key value pair yeah okay you're still
 

373
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,750
key value pair yeah okay you're still
thinking about the aquarium

374
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
thinking about the aquarium
 

375
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,910
thinking about the aquarium
yeah okay i'm going to erase this okay

376
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
yeah okay i'm going to erase this okay
 

377

so s i
 

405
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,190
so s i
yeah delta s i bracket [ __ ] it

406
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
yeah delta s i bracket [ __ ] it
 

407
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,190
yeah delta s i bracket [ __ ] it
is smaller than delta smaller than delta

408
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
is smaller than delta smaller than delta
