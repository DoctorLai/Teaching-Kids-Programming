00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360

 

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,230

okay so

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
okay so
 

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,070
okay so
today we'll continue talking about uh

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
today we'll continue talking about uh
 

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,470
today we'll continue talking about uh
parentheses called valid parentheses

10
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,480
parentheses called valid parentheses
 

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,070
parentheses called valid parentheses
yeah this will be your last day of

12
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
yeah this will be your last day of
 

13
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,349
yeah this will be your last day of
parentheses yeah

14
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
parentheses yeah
 

15
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,109
parentheses yeah
so remember previously we talked about

16
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
so remember previously we talked about
 

17
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,429
so remember previously we talked about
valid processes only including these

18
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:27,439
valid processes only including these
 

19
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,830
valid processes only including these
brackets right

20
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
brackets right
 

21
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,270
brackets right
yeah how about if we also

22
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
yeah how about if we also
 

23
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,389
yeah how about if we also
consider curly brace and square bracket

24
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
consider curly brace and square bracket
 

25
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,350
consider curly brace and square bracket
yeah so if it's a very princesses it

26
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
yeah so if it's a very princesses it
 

27
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,750
yeah so if it's a very princesses it
could be something like that

28
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
could be something like that
 

29
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,830
could be something like that
yeah something like that

30
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
yeah something like that
 

31
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,549
yeah something like that
do you get it yeah this is a valid

32
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
do you get it yeah this is a valid
 

33
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,110
do you get it yeah this is a valid
because

34
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
because
 

35
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,110
because
everything is impaired but this is not

36
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
everything is impaired but this is not
 

37
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,310
everything is impaired but this is not
impaired

38
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
impaired
 

39
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,630
impaired
this is not this is not

40
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
this is not this is not
 

41
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,389
this is not this is not
do you get it yeah

42
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399

 

43
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,030

this is not right because even it's

44
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
this is not right because even it's
 

45
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,230
this is not right because even it's
opening close but this

46
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
opening close but this
 

47
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,270
opening close but this
does not match right yeah okay so

48
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
does not match right yeah okay so
 

49
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,550
does not match right yeah okay so
our task is to do to design an

50
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
our task is to do to design an
 

51
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,749
our task is to do to design an
algorithm

52
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759

 

53
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,789

algorithm yeah algorithm to to solve

54
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
algorithm yeah algorithm to to solve
 

55
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,070
algorithm yeah algorithm to to solve
this problem okay

56
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
this problem okay
 

57
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,830
this problem okay
yeah thank you for doing that

58
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
yeah thank you for doing that
 

59
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,230
yeah thank you for doing that
so remember any ideas

60
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
so remember any ideas
 

61
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,950
so remember any ideas
i mean how do we do that i don't

62
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
i mean how do we do that i don't
 

63
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,550
i mean how do we do that i don't
understand what we're doing

64
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
understand what we're doing
 

65
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,390
understand what we're doing
i was just talking about that i mean to

66
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
i was just talking about that i mean to
 

67
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,910
i was just talking about that i mean to
check if it is a string

68
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
check if it is a string
 

69
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,630
check if it is a string
like that is if it's a very this should

70
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
like that is if it's a very this should
 

71
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,149
like that is if it's a very this should
give me force

72
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
give me force
 

73
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,429
give me force
this should give me true yeah

74
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
this should give me true yeah
 

75
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,350
this should give me true yeah
these two these

76
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
these two these
 

77
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,590
these two these
two these

78
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
two these
 

79
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,590
two these
uh this fourth okay

80
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
uh this fourth okay
 

81
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,109
uh this fourth okay
so remember previously we we we

82
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
so remember previously we we we
 

83
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,429
so remember previously we we we
use a balance counter right when we meet

84
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
use a balance counter right when we meet
 

85
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,830
use a balance counter right when we meet
opening with plus one when we mean

86
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
opening with plus one when we mean
 

87
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,830
opening with plus one when we mean
closing with minus one and we check if

88
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
closing with minus one and we check if
 

89
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,030
closing with minus one and we check if
it's yellow right

90
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
it's yellow right
 

91
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,350
it's yellow right
if any time it falls below zero then

92
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
if any time it falls below zero then
 

93
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,229
if any time it falls below zero then
it's invalid

94
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
it's invalid
 

95
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,949
it's invalid
all right because it falls below zero it

96
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
all right because it falls below zero it
 

97
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,790
all right because it falls below zero it
means we don't have enough

98
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
means we don't have enough
 

99
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,309
means we don't have enough
opening brackets

100
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319

 

101
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,390

like this one

102
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
like this one
 

103
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,670
like this one
zero minus one one is negative one is

104
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
zero minus one one is negative one is
 

105
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,589
zero minus one one is negative one is
below zero it means we don't have enough

106
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
below zero it means we don't have enough
 

107
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,030
below zero it means we don't have enough
opening all right

108
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
opening all right
 

109
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,350
opening all right
so it means we will deal with ten

110
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
so it means we will deal with ten
 

111
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,670
so it means we will deal with ten
fourths immediately

112
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
fourths immediately
 

113
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,190
fourths immediately
if this one is one and this one minus

114
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
if this one is one and this one minus
 

115
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,670
if this one is one and this one minus
one

116
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
one
 

117
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,710
one
and this uh a3 and this quantity

118
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
and this uh a3 and this quantity
 

119
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,830
and this uh a3 and this quantity
and this are three and this one three

120
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
and this are three and this one three
 

121
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,670
and this are three and this one three
no look it could work a little bit but

122
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
no look it could work a little bit but
 

123
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,070
no look it could work a little bit but
no

124
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
no
 

125
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,550
no
look if you add two what happened like

126
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
look if you add two what happened like
 

127
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,470
look if you add two what happened like
if you're saying that uh

128
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
if you're saying that uh
 

129
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,670
if you're saying that uh
uh these at one and these at two right

130
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
uh these at one and these at two right
 

131
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,790
uh these at one and these at two right
and this s3 right yeah oh okay so if

132
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
and this s3 right yeah oh okay so if
 

133
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,830
and this s3 right yeah oh okay so if
this is minus two all right and

134
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840
this is minus two all right and
 

135
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,990
this is minus two all right and
hopefully

136
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
hopefully
 

137
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,190
hopefully
one one two one one is yellow this is

138
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
one one two one one is yellow this is
 

139
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,229
one one two one one is yellow this is
apparently not very

140
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
apparently not very
 

141
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,110
apparently not very
valid yeah did you get it so this this

142
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
valid yeah did you get it so this this
 

143
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,710
valid yeah did you get it so this this
of course stuff you know what

144
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
of course stuff you know what
 

145
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,949
of course stuff you know what
got it yeah okay

146
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959

 

147
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,350

so the the tricky part is that we need

148
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
so the the tricky part is that we need
 

149
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,149
so the the tricky part is that we need
to check

150
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
to check
 

151
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,430
to check
if the opening is the one we want okay

152
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
if the opening is the one we want okay
 

153
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,190
if the opening is the one we want okay
even yeah so remember we talked about a

154
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
even yeah so remember we talked about a
 

155
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,110
even yeah so remember we talked about a
sec before what stack

156
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
sec before what stack
 

157
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,130
sec before what stack
can you remind me

158
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,140

 

159
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:44,949

[Music]

160
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959

 

161
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,630

the beginning yeah why you change your

162
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
the beginning yeah why you change your
 

163
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,910
the beginning yeah why you change your
answer to first thing first off

164
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
answer to first thing first off
 

165
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,110
answer to first thing first off
okay so let's take visually okay if you

166
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
okay so let's take visually okay if you
 

167
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,070
okay so let's take visually okay if you
put something in

168
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
put something in
 

169
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,509
put something in
put a if we put eric in

170
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
put a if we put eric in
 

171
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:13,110
put a if we put eric in
then we put ryan in

172

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
another opening i put it here okay now
 

207
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,909
another opening i put it here okay now
it's closing yeah

208
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
it's closing yeah
 

209
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,790
it's closing yeah
what is going to mean any of these we

210
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
what is going to mean any of these we
 

211
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,110
what is going to mean any of these we
look

212
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
look
 

213
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,990
look
at the topless deck right okay this

214
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
at the topless deck right okay this
 

215
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,350
at the topless deck right okay this
topper stack is this

216
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
topper stack is this
 

217
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,670
topper stack is this
it doesn't match this one yes then we

218
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
it doesn't match this one yes then we
 

219
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,390
it doesn't match this one yes then we
continue

220
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
continue
 

221
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,990
continue
we take it out we continue does it makes

222
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
we take it out we continue does it makes
 

223
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,469
we take it out we continue does it makes
match this one yes we take it off yeah

224
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
match this one yes we take it off yeah
 

225
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,150
match this one yes we take it off yeah
does it make match this one no yes

226
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
does it make match this one no yes
 

227
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,230
does it make match this one no yes
i'm going to take it off yes yes and

228
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
i'm going to take it off yes yes and
 

229
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,390
i'm going to take it off yes yes and
then look if it doesn't match then for

230
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
then look if it doesn't match then for
 

231
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,230
then look if it doesn't match then for
example if you start to match

232
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
example if you start to match
 

233
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,830
example if you start to match
like that okay yeah doesn't match

234
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
like that okay yeah doesn't match
 

235
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,189
like that okay yeah doesn't match
uh this is the set

236
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
uh this is the set
 

237
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,189
uh this is the set
yeah if it if it is the

238
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
yeah if it if it is the
 

239
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,430
yeah if it if it is the
does not match right then will be turned

240
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
does not match right then will be turned
 

241
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,790
does not match right then will be turned
forth immediately

242
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
forth immediately
 

243
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,189
forth immediately
you see and at the end we need to check

244
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
you see and at the end we need to check
 

245
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,950
you see and at the end we need to check
if this stack is empty

246
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
if this stack is empty
 

247
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,790
if this stack is empty
if it's not empty it means that some

248
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
if it's not empty it means that some
 

249
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,790
if it's not empty it means that some
brackets are now closing right

250
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
brackets are now closing right
 

251
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,390
brackets are now closing right
like this if you look i push two twice

252
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
like this if you look i push two twice
 

253
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,270
like this if you look i push two twice
30 degrees of brackets and then i mean

254
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
30 degrees of brackets and then i mean
 

255
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,629
30 degrees of brackets and then i mean
this one i take this out

256
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
this one i take this out
 

257
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,350
this one i take this out
it match yeah okay and look what

258
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
it match yeah okay and look what
 

259
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,830
it match yeah okay and look what
happened

260
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
happened
 

261
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,550
happened
we have one more needs to be close so

262
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
we have one more needs to be close so
 

263
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,029
we have one more needs to be close so
it's not

264
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
it's not
 

265
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,629
it's not
a valid one does it doesn't make sense

266
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
a valid one does it doesn't make sense
 

267
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,550
a valid one does it doesn't make sense
so this stack is very useful in this

268
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
so this stack is very useful in this
 

269
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,390
so this stack is very useful in this
case yeah okay hop

270
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
case yeah okay hop
 

271
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,029
case yeah okay hop
right let's learn the problem can i have

272
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
right let's learn the problem can i have
 

273
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:23,430
right let's learn the problem can i have
like

274
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
like
 

275
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,790
like

defined you choose it valid
 

285
00:06:48,800 --> 00:07:05,740
defined you choose it valid
princesses yeah then this is

286
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:05,750

 

287
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:19,749

[Music]

288
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759

 

289
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,670

this means the list but we can use it as

290
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
this means the list but we can use it as
 

291
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,029
this means the list but we can use it as
a stack right remember

292
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
a stack right remember
 

293
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,790
a stack right remember
yeah okay so why unite

294
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
yeah okay so why unite
 

295
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,990
yeah okay so why unite
yeah for i is s

296
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
yeah for i is s
 

297
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,350
yeah for i is s
column yeah

298
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
column yeah
 

299
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,710
column yeah
so now we need to find out if i if i

300
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
so now we need to find out if i if i
 

301
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,309
so now we need to find out if i if i
in look we can use in to

302
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
in look we can use in to
 

303
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,670
in look we can use in to
to check if this is enough in

304
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
to check if this is enough in
 

305
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,710
to check if this is enough in
in in this piece right

306
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
in in this piece right
 

307
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,070
in in this piece right
if it's in the open bracket curly brace

308
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,080
if it's in the open bracket curly brace
 

309
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,350
if it's in the open bracket curly brace
and then square bracket if it's one of

yeah if it's one of these then we push
 

315
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,589
yeah if it's one of these then we push
it into the stack stop the append right

331
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,950

ryan then we need to check if the stack

332
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
ryan then we need to check if the stack
 

333
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,070
ryan then we need to check if the stack
is empty or not right

334
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
is empty or not right
 

335
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,629
is empty or not right
if we already mean this one even at the

336
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
if we already mean this one even at the
 

337
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,589
if we already mean this one even at the

beginning
 

339
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,990
beginning
the stack is empty right if we all have

340
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
the stack is empty right if we all have
 

341
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,870
the stack is empty right if we all have
the closing one

342
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
the closing one
 

343
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,190
the closing one
it's invalid we can't pop any element

344
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
it's invalid we can't pop any element
 

345
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,350
it's invalid we can't pop any element
there's nothing in the stack right

346
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
there's nothing in the stack right
 

347
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,430
there's nothing in the stack right
so we need to check in this case if then

348
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
so we need to check in this case if then
 

349
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,350
so we need to check in this case if then
nothing in the stack is invalid

nothing in the stack is invalid
 

351
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,030
nothing in the stack is invalid
right so we need to check a and

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
right so we need to check a and
 

353
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,310
right so we need to check a and
c is zero equals equals right that means

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
c is zero equals equals right that means
 

355
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,310
c is zero equals equals right that means

364
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
look the top of the stack right
 

365
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,150
look the top of the stack right
look if you are using a list like even a

366
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
look if you are using a list like even a
 

367
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,790
look if you are using a list like even a
step if the list is one two three

368
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
step if the list is one two three
 

369
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,710
step if the list is one two three
um do you still remember this before

370
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
um do you still remember this before
 

371
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,070
um do you still remember this before
this is one two three

372
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
this is one two three
 

373
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,829
this is one two three
yeah the minus one yes minus one is

374
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
yeah the minus one yes minus one is
 

375
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,590
yeah the minus one yes minus one is
three yeah the last element

376
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
three yeah the last element
 

377
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,190
three yeah the last element
yes zero is the beginning

378
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
yes zero is the beginning
 

379
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,470
yes zero is the beginning
right yeah

380
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480

 

381
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,190

okay okay okay that's it that's it okay

382
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
okay okay okay that's it that's it okay
 

383
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,710
okay okay okay that's it that's it okay
now

384
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720

 

385
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,110

if mistake if the the previous the

386
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
if mistake if the the previous the
 

387
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,949
if mistake if the the previous the
top of the step right even the top of

388
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
top of the step right even the top of
 

389
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,430
top of the step right even the top of
stack is this one

390
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
stack is this one
 

391
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,269
stack is this one
is the top topper stack

392
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
is the top topper stack
 

393
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,470
is the top topper stack
plus now current current one is

394
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
plus now current current one is
 

395
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,070
plus now current current one is
also in in what in this this

396
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
also in in what in this this
 

397
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,150
also in in what in this this
is a very pair yeah this is the red pair

398
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
is a very pair yeah this is the red pair
 

399
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,190
is a very pair yeah this is the red pair
this is a very pair right

400
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
this is a very pair right
 

401
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,430
this is a very pair right
if not in this is the red pair but we

402
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
if not in this is the red pair but we
 

403
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,630
if not in this is the red pair but we
are looking for not

404
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
are looking for not
 

405
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,230
are looking for not
so not this one

406
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
so not this one
 

407
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,590
so not this one
column return fourth right

408
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
column return fourth right
 

409
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,750
column return fourth right
yeah and then after that we need to

410
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
yeah and then after that we need to
 

411
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,069
yeah and then after that we need to
publish from the second t

412
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
publish from the second t
 

413
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,910
publish from the second t
dot pop

414
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920

 

415
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,990

this is popular last element if we want

416
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
this is popular last element if we want
 

417
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,750
this is popular last element if we want
to pop the first element

418
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760

 

419
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,870

yeah we need to check if it's listed

420
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
yeah we need to check if it's listed
 

421
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,350
yeah we need to check if it's listed
this is empty right let's take it empty

422
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
this is empty right let's take it empty
 

423
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,470
this is empty right let's take it empty
okay so

424
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
okay so
 

425
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,790
okay so
so can you tell me if i want to check

426
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
so can you tell me if i want to check
 

427
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,910
so can you tell me if i want to check
the beginning of

428
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
the beginning of
 

429
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,230
the beginning of
we want to even list this one two three

430
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
we want to even list this one two three
 

431
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,430
we want to even list this one two three
if i want to pop

432
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
if i want to pop
 

433
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,389
if i want to pop
this element out first first thing first

434
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
this element out first first thing first
 

435
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,750
this element out first first thing first
or how do we do this

436
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
or how do we do this
 

437
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,910
or how do we do this
first so he needs to go out so he goes

438
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
first so he needs to go out so he goes
 

439
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,470
first so he needs to go out so he goes
out

440
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
out
 

441
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,430
out
yeah that's st pop right yeah and how

442
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
yeah that's st pop right yeah and how
 

443
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,870
yeah that's st pop right yeah and how
about if i want the popular one

444
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
about if i want the popular one
 

445
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,389
about if i want the popular one
oh what do i do

446
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399

 

447
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,430

that one no no what i'm saying that

448
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
that one no no what i'm saying that
 

449
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,069
that one no no what i'm saying that
if if we are using this stack this is

450
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
if if we are using this stack this is
 

451
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,230
if if we are using this stack this is
this as a queue we want to pop the first

452
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
this as a queue we want to pop the first
 

453
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,790
this as a queue we want to pop the first
element

454
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
element
 

455
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,389
element
out and we need to pop zero remember

456
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
out and we need to pop zero remember
 

457
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:08,710
out and we need to pop zero remember
this

458
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
this
 

459
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,750
this
zero means the first one yeah yeah

460
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
zero means the first one yeah yeah
 

461
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,110
zero means the first one yeah yeah
okay okay so this is the basic so

462
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
okay okay so this is the basic so
 

463
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,350
okay okay so this is the basic so
what's the complexity what's the

464
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
what's the complexity what's the
 

465
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,470
what's the complexity what's the
complexity

466

469
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,030

because yes n is the number of the

470
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
because yes n is the number of the
 

471
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,550
because yes n is the number of the

472
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
character in the string
 

473
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,670
character in the string
how about the space complexity

474
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
how about the space complexity
 

475
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,069
how about the space complexity
yeah space complexity do we need to

476
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
yeah space complexity do we need to
 

477
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,150
yeah space complexity do we need to
allocate a space for this problem

478
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
allocate a space for this problem
 

479
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,230
allocate a space for this problem
nine why not we're using a stack why not

480
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,240
nine why not we're using a stack why not
 

481
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,750
nine why not we're using a stack why not
because it becomes

482
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
because it becomes

because it becomes
what's your opinion

484
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880

 

485
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,230

are they not cleanly sorry

486
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
are they not cleanly sorry
 

487
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,470
are they not cleanly sorry
you say bravely it doesn't matter i

488
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
you say bravely it doesn't matter i
 

489
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,269
you say bravely it doesn't matter i
don't know

490
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
don't know
 

491
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,550
don't know
make a guess it's on that

492
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
make a guess it's on that
 

493
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,750
make a guess it's on that
board what's the space capacity yeah

494
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
board what's the space capacity yeah
 

495
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,389
board what's the space capacity yeah
yeah

496
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
yeah
 

497
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,190
yeah
because we're using a stack yeah yeah

498
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
because we're using a stack yeah yeah
 

499
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,590
because we're using a stack yeah yeah
we're using the stack in the worst case

500
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
we're using the stack in the worst case
 

501
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,870
we're using the stack in the worst case
the stack for example if the string

502
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
the stack for example if the string
 

503
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,509
the stack for example if the string

opening there's no popping right all
right

510
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
right
 

511
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,550
right
then the stack will contain these or

512
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
then the stack will contain these or

when there are encounters in a string

520
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
when there are encounters in a string
 

521
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,430
when there are encounters in a string
you need another space

522
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
you need another space
 

523
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,470
you need another space
another space which contains and

another space which contains and

another space which contains and
cut and elements in a stack i'm right

526
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
cut and elements in a stack i'm right
 

527
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,910
cut and elements in a stack i'm right
yeah yeah that's

528
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
yeah yeah that's
 

529
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,790
yeah yeah that's
that's why it's called om complexity of

530
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
that's why it's called om complexity of

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,590
that's why it's called om complexity of

that's because of time yeah when you

538
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
that's because of time yeah when you

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,030
that's because of time yeah when you
when when we talk about time we talk

540
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
when when we talk about time we talk
 

541
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,389
when when we talk about time we talk
about how many times

542
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
about how many times
 

543
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,269
about how many times
how many iterations the computer needs

544
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
how many iterations the computer needs
 

545
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,069
how many iterations the computer needs
to process

546
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
to process
 

547
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,470
to process
right but this stack is if we are using

548
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
right but this stack is if we are using
 

549
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,310
right but this stack is if we are using
an additional

550
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
an additional
 

551
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,430
an additional
storage to keep the elements right and

552
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
storage to keep the elements right and
 

553
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,110
storage to keep the elements right and
in the worst case there is no

554
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
in the worst case there is no
 

555
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,069
in the worst case there is no
popping from the stack in in the worst

556
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
popping from the stack in in the worst
 

557
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:04,629
popping from the stack in in the worst
case

558
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
case
 

559
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,269
case
the string contains all the push right

560
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
the string contains all the push right
 

561
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,550
the string contains all the push right
all opening and then

562
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
all opening and then
 

563
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,389
all opening and then
this stack needs that for example if you

564
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
this stack needs that for example if you
 

565
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,750
this stack needs that for example if you
lay 100

566
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
lay 100
 

567
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,470
lay 100
a string size is 100 characters and i

568
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
a string size is 100 characters and i
 

569
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,670
a string size is 100 characters and i
need to add stack

570
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
need to add stack
 

571
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,790
need to add stack
which can hold at least

572
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
which can hold at least
 

573
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,350
which can hold at least
100 characters do you get it yeah this

574
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
100 characters do you get it yeah this
 

575
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,710
100 characters do you get it yeah this
is what it means first of all

576
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
is what it means first of all
 

577
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,230
is what it means first of all
okay good job today the last thing

578
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
okay good job today the last thing
 

579
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:34,240
okay good job today the last thing
say goodbye
