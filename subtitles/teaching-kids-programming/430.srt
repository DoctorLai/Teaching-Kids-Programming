[Music]

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,920
for each one you can there are only two

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,520
kinds

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,800
of either win or you lose

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,800
right so you either win or lose

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,920
you win or lose

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,640
so what how many how many ways that in

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,840
which that you can have this consecutive

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,920
k wins or less okay wins

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,920
or less

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,239
but it has to be consecutive what's

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,000
consecutive order

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,200
okay

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,200
one two three consecutive

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,719
uh it continues right so you win like

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,680
you win the first game second game third

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,920
game that's consecutive but if you win

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,920
first game you lose the second game you

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,120
win the third game this is nothing

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
consecutive

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,560
so we are looking forward

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,360
we're looking for a number of ways that

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,439
you can have you can win k times

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,080
consecutive or less right so for example

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,840
last week one can n equal three and then

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,320
k equals two

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,080
so we play three games

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,080
and then look we can win

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,600
if we have look

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,000
if we play three games what's how many

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,200
how many kind of different situation

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,079
would that be i mean what's the

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,520
permutation total number of permutation

35
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,200
you should be able to answer this

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,960
question quickly

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,040
we play three games each one has two

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,360
possibilities how many possibilities all

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,920
together

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,200
the a yeah exactly two to the power of n

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,360
equals

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,840
eight okay at this time okay so

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,200
look if i write this a

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,000
in so you can you should be able to

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,399
write lr

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,560
what's r okay so actually it's win okay

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,560
win

48
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,280
okay and

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,720
okay so these

50
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,400
oh i read the argument why don't

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,400
keep writing on this r again

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,160
okay

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,400
how many how many one two three four

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,760
five six seven eight okay

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,360
uh

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,040
yeah yeah

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,040
so lose three times in a row

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,160
k equals two yeah yeah i know so which

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,560
one which

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,640
these are all possibilities eight a of

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
possibilities how many of them have

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,640
these k

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,519
less than k less than two consecutive

64
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,800
that one doesn't this one doesn't this

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,920
one

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
yes

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,040
yes

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,000
yes yes yes yes yes all right

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,000
yeah

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,760
so that's seven okay so you just give me

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,599
the seven right

72
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,920
yeah

73
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,840
so what's the sauce i mean what are we

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,400
doing here what are we doing what's this

75
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,480
what's this approach if we eat uh

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,840
internet uh if we

77
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,640
list all the possibilities

78
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,879
what what what's this method called

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,879
um

80
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,560
yeah yeah yeah and and we have to do

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,879
this two to the power of n times this is

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,280
just to iterate to list all the

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,640
possibilities of all of all the games

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,280
and we have to find out how many of them

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,080
are consecutive yeah so this point this

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,319
is

87
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,760
the time complexity if we are given a

88
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,159
game outcome and it takes on time to

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,760
check if they are less than k

90
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,799
if it meets the requirements so the time

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,200
from next to is time complexities o n

92
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,760
times two to the power n right this is

93
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,560
total total complexity okay do you get

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,560
it

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,159
yeah so certainly we don't we don't want

96
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,920
this so at least it's too complicated

97
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,000
right too complicated

98
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,080
yeah okay so how about if we i can tell

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,680
you like if like let's say we define the

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,000
function f f i comma j what does it mean

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,759
okay listen carefully okay it means that

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,400
we are playing

103
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,400
we are playing at ice game

104
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,520
and we have now

105
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,320
j win consecutive wins

106
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,320
consecutive win okay consecutive wind

107
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,520
bowling game okay consecutively wins

108
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,479
okay so look so let's say look i have uh

109
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,199
place the icon okay so i have

110
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,199
root loose

111
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,320
i know but this is example but as an

112
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,479
input okay so let's see look

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,360
okay so they are i yeah

114
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,080
this their eye here so this is i

115
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,919
they're eyes okay eyes

116
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,120
and then we have

117
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,440
j wins very consecutive okay

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,440
yeah

119
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,120
so okay so i'm playing the i plus one

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,479
game here okay this is i plus one game

121
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,759
here

122
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,880
how many possibilities for this game

123
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,639
times

124
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,600
how many possibilities

125
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,919
i'm playing i plus one game

126
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
what's the outcome of this game

127
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,840
um

128
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,400
how many come on

129
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,160
ryan how many what if i'm playing this

130
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,160
game i scan how many possibilities

131
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,440
um for this game i mean two yeah we know

132
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,240
lose exactly

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,039
yeah we not lose lose or win

134
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,080
right

135
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,759
so if i lose if i lose

136
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,240
if i lose

137
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,400
so i'm playing i plus one again but if i

138
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,919
lose what happens to this consecutive

139
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,360
week

140
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:02,800
okay but if i win j plus one

141
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,120
yeah i plus one j plus n exactly yeah

142
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,800
that's very good yeah so so the outcome

143
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,319
will be so this look f i

144
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:16,560
j will be equal to these two angles here

145
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,160
exactly right and one i when will the i

146
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,560
play the

147
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,160
one way i reach the end means that we

148
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,199
have finished all again

149
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,400
right

150
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,199
yeah

151
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,680
then

152
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,039
then we should check if j is less than

153
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,199
or equal than k right yeah okay

154
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,319
okay so about one k

155
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,080
the one k when when the j is bigger than

156
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,960
k we return

157
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,600
zero right because we want the we want

158
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,600
we don't want the consecutive wins more

159
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,000
than k right this is the requirement

160
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,720
right yeah so but we so we with this we

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,160
can

162
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
we should be able to implement this

163
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,080
using recursion right easy

164
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,080
okay let's try this in recursion

165
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,880
wow

166
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,400
f i

167
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,759
j

168
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,280
if

169
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,479
if j is bigger than k

170
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,400
return

171
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,400
what within zero one come on

172
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,740
is

173
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,740
[Music]

174
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,240
plus f i plus one j yeah this is the

175
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,360
recursive recursion the current formula

176
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,240
right the i plus one j plus

177
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,840
what's the time complexity for this one

178
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,599
um what's the temperature

179
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,360
actually what are we doing here what's

180
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,599
the thumbs up let's say it's the same as

181
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,520
proof of that something like that right

182
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,000
because each one each one you have two

183
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,160
possibilities each one you have two so

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,479
two to the power of n right but how do

185
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,680
we make it faster what's the missing

186
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,479
thing here

187
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,080
cash cash yeah so

188
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,759
what do you mean what does

189
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,680
what happened if we put a cash what

190
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,240
happened

191
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,560
what happened if we put a test uh with

192
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,680
is an explanation

193
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,720
yeah why is that because we're

194
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,240
remembering we're memorizing it right so

195
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,120
so look i

196
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,039
i

197
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,319
has n right i is from 0 to n and

198
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,120
to n minus 1 so there are n states of i

199
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,640
and they are k stay for the j

200
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,640
so the time complexes o

201
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,399
how many states of these

202
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,399
um

203
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,480
how many states right

204
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,800
how many look at that

205
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,440
no no how many states there are n n

206
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,600
possibilities here and f k possibility

207
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,519
how many total states

208
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,959
n times k okay

209
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,680
and the time conducts the space

210
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,000
complexity is also uh and o n times k

211
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,279
why is that because they are and most o

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,880
and uh n times k states we need to

213
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,320
memorize minimize yeah minimalism

214
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,519
okay so what does this mean look at oh

215
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,120
and okay so we can do a tree here we can

216
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,160
do a tree

217
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,160
we can do a tree okay

218
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,279
okay so for example

219
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,240
at the beginning we put f00 and then

220
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,080
we need to go from f1

221
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,519
f1 0

222
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,120
and then leads to f1

223
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,880
1 right look

224
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:39,120
f1 0 again you go to f2

225
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:44,399
cll and then plus what f2 right you see

226
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:47,200
so f1 will go to f to zlo and

227
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,200
f2

228
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,080
f22 again right is it two no no f2 one

229
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,320
look f2 zero f21 here so what's the

230
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,440
problem here if i i'm just iterating at

231
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,000
least a few iterations the problem is

232
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
what look look at here

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,959
this one

234
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,000
two zero

235
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,959
and here f two zero as well right

236
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,200
so

237
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,440
once twice so i the first time i

238
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,360
calculate it i i i minimize it i

239
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,000
memorize it right so when i calculate

240
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,519
this one i don't have to explain the

241
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
tree here right

242
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,920
for example you take one day you spend

243
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,040
one day in this tree right you spend one

244
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,600
day finding out the f21 value but here

245
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,680
you want to calculate f to one

246
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,519
f to zero here

247
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,120
do you need to spend another one data

248
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,440
why is that because i remember this yeah

249
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,160
yeah exactly so i put it down i put it

250
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,920
down on the notebook hash table

251
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,640
right it's the same thing

252
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,640
you work out a very complex complicated

253
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,600
mathematic problem

254
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,920
right

255
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,000
you put it down on your notebook

256
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
the next day you find out okay it's the

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
same question do you still have to go

258
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,440
through this right you just look it up

259
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
right you just tell teddy okay i know it

260
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,760
click a one constant right so that's how

261
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,600
we speed up

262
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,519
using this cache okay this is this is

263
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,640
quite similar to fibonacci number

264
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,000
remember what's fibonacci number

265
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,839
what's fibonacci number one one

266
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,959
two what's the next fibonacci number

267
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,000
three

268
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,360
five

269
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,240
eight

270
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,839
thirteen etcetera yeah exactly f i

271
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,560
equals twenty one

272
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:33,200
yeah plus plus f i plus look so the

273
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,880
first two numbers equals the added

274
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
together will be the next number yeah so

275
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,640
this number is

276
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,200
f n equals f n minus one plus f n minus

277
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,680
two that is quite similar to this yeah

278
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,760
so you expand this uh fibonacci you'll

279
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,560
find lots of these

280
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,320
f values are repeated so we have to

281
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,440
cache it right that's the magic of

282
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,079
caching

283
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,600
here okay so here is the same yeah for

284
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,760
each game

285
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,680
this is top-down top-down dynamic

286
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,240
programming using recursion instead

287
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,600
using the keywords minimization so at

288
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,959
this game

289
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,839
we we know we have already played i game

290
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,160
ice game yeah and then we have j

291
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,639
consecutive win and so if we play the

292
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,920
next game we have two possibilities

293
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,920
either win

294
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,720
continuous straight yes straight what

295
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,720
this means check

296
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,040
straight yeah

297
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,680
we continue we win we keep the stretch

298
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,079
oh we lose we reset it to zero right

299
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,360
easy right yeah and then we finish the

300
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:38,399
game uh when i equals n we return one

301
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,480
yeah because at this point j why we can

302
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,720
return one here because at this point j

303
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,040
is smaller or equal k why is that

304
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,639
because if j is bigger than k we already

305
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,839
be ten zero okay

306
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,959
yeah

307
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:54,920
that'll be it for today good job

308
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,920
bye bye bye
