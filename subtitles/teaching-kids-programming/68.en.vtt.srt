no it means the monotony you can at the

30
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
no it means the monotony you can at the
 

31
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,350
no it means the monotony you can at the
moment

32
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
moment
 

33
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,709

increasing increasing or more level of

34
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
increasing increasing or more level of

00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480

 

37
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,069

okay so the mean look alright

38
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
okay so the mean look alright
 

39
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,150
okay so the mean look alright
function by function look this is the

40
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
function by function look this is the
 

41
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,510
function by function look this is the
monotony

42
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
monotony
 

43
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,870
monotony
monotony function because when x grows

44
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
monotony function because when x grows
 

45
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,469
monotony function because when x grows
when x grows the bigger x is attention

46
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
when x grows the bigger x is attention
 

47
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,750
when x grows the bigger x is attention
monotony when x

48
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
monotony when x
 

49
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,789
monotony when x
grows y also grows the bigger x will

50
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
grows y also grows the bigger x will
 

51
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,830
grows y also grows the bigger x will
give bigger y

52
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
give bigger y
 

53
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,070
give bigger y
right yes less monotony so how about

54
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
right yes less monotony so how about
 

55
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,950
right yes less monotony so how about
this

56
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
this
 

57
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,749
this
how about this how about this graph is

58
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
how about this how about this graph is
 

59
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,670
how about this how about this graph is
this monotony

60
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
this monotony
 

61
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,670
this monotony
no no it's monotony increased decreasing

62
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
no no it's monotony increased decreasing
 

63
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,710
no no it's monotony increased decreasing
the bigger x the smaller y

64
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
the bigger x the smaller y
 

65
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,710
the bigger x the smaller y
do you get it so because the trend is

66
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
do you get it so because the trend is
 

67
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,710
do you get it so because the trend is
going the same direction

68
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
going the same direction
 

69
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,149
going the same direction
but this is no monotony this is not

70
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
but this is no monotony this is not
 

71
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,069
but this is no monotony this is not
right because it goes down and goes up

72
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079
right because it goes down and goes up
 

73
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,069
right because it goes down and goes up
right this is what morning monotony

74
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
right this is what morning monotony
 

75
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,950
right this is what morning monotony
means

76
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
means
 

77
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,630
means
it can be monetary increasing or

78
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
it can be monetary increasing or
 

79
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,550
it can be monetary increasing or
monolithically decreasing do you get it

80
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
monolithically decreasing do you get it
 

81
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,670
monolithically decreasing do you get it
this is monetary increasing array

82
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
this is monetary increasing array
 

83
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,789
this is monetary increasing array
because x array is always increasing

84
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
because x array is always increasing
 

85
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,550
because x array is always increasing
right yeah and this one is always

86
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
right yeah and this one is always
 

87
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,749
right yeah and this one is always
d decreasing right okay so our task

88
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
d decreasing right okay so our task
 

89
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,990
d decreasing right okay so our task
today is very simple

90
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
today is very simple
 

91
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,870
today is very simple
simple so you're given the numbers at

92
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
simple so you're given the numbers at
 

93
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,429
simple so you're given the numbers at
least

94
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
least
 

95
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,150
least
arranged at least the numbers yeah one

96
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
arranged at least the numbers yeah one
 

97
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,949
arranged at least the numbers yeah one
three

98
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
three
 

99
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,070
three
five like like two seven is this a

100
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
five like like two seven is this a
 

101
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,030
five like like two seven is this a
monotony no

102
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
monotony no
 

103
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,949
monotony no
no okay so given the function

104
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
no okay so given the function
 

105
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,150
no okay so given the function
it's easy monitoring yeah

106
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
it's easy monitoring yeah
 

107
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,589
it's easy monitoring yeah
any given numbers so return true

108
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
any given numbers so return true
 

109
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,150
any given numbers so return true
if it's either monetary increasing or

110
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
if it's either monetary increasing or
 

111
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,430
if it's either monetary increasing or
monetary decreasing

112
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
monetary decreasing
 

113
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,190
monetary decreasing
return force if it's not so

114
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
return force if it's not so
 

115
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,630
return force if it's not so
any ideas how can we do it just see

116
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
any ideas how can we do it just see
 

117
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,830
any ideas how can we do it just see
it's going down number one yeah i know

118
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
it's going down number one yeah i know
 

119
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,830
it's going down number one yeah i know
but how to do it

120
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
but how to do it
 

121
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,270
but how to do it
how do you do it one

122
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
how do you do it one
 

123
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,630
how do you do it one
is what smoothness is

124
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
is what smoothness is
 

125
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,350
is what smoothness is
one is smaller greater than three so

126
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
one is smaller greater than three so
 

127
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,589
one is smaller greater than three so
it's smaller so we just keep smooth it

128
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
it's smaller so we just keep smooth it
 

129
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,550
it's smaller so we just keep smooth it
is smaller

130
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
is smaller
 

131
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,990
is smaller
yes

132
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000

 

133
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,509

not not not nice quite close quite close

134
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
not not not nice quite close quite close
 

135
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,710
not not not nice quite close quite close
so all right quite close so

136
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
so all right quite close so
 

137
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,390
so all right quite close so
so basically quite close so one hint is

138
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
so basically quite close so one hint is
 

139
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,430
so basically quite close so one hint is
you check the

140
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
you check the
 

141
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,830
you check the
neighbor numbers yeah for example if i

142
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
neighbor numbers yeah for example if i
 

143
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,430
neighbor numbers yeah for example if i
want to check increasing like

144
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
want to check increasing like
 

145
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,190
want to check increasing like
i check it's less number it's always

146
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
i check it's less number it's always
 

147
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,110
i check it's less number it's always
bigger than it's five bigger the

148
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
bigger than it's five bigger the
 

149
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,470
bigger than it's five bigger the
next number is bigger than current

150
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
next number is bigger than current
 

151
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,630
next number is bigger than current
number is fine this one

152
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
number is fine this one
 

153
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,630
number is fine this one
no right because no because two is

154
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
no right because no because two is
 

155
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,670
no right because no because two is
smaller than five

156
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
smaller than five
 

157
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,270
smaller than five
that in this case would return false

158
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
that in this case would return false
 

159
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,350
that in this case would return false
right yeah okay so

160
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
right yeah okay so
 

161
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,509
right yeah okay so
but but but you need to have two

162
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
but but but you need to have two
 

163
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,430
but but but you need to have two
functions right one is to check either

164
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
functions right one is to check either
 

165
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,990
functions right one is to check either
monotony

166
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
monotony
 

167
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,910
monotony
increasing or the other one is to check

168
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
increasing or the other one is to check
 

169
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,229
increasing or the other one is to check
monitoring decreasing right

170
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
monitoring decreasing right
 

171
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,869
monitoring decreasing right
right yeah so here you will say return

172
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
right yeah so here you will say return
 

173
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,830
right yeah so here you will say return
is it increasing i am just increasing

174
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
is it increasing i am just increasing
 

175
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,710
is it increasing i am just increasing
okay

176
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
okay
 

177
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,149
okay
nums this is check increasing numbers

178
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
nums this is check increasing numbers
 

179
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,509
nums this is check increasing numbers
or decreasing yeah

180
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
or decreasing yeah
 

181
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,630
or decreasing yeah
decreasing numbers

182
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640

 

183
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,390

okay and then i need to implement these

184
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
okay and then i need to implement these
 

185
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,670
okay and then i need to implement these
two functions right

186
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
two functions right
 

187
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,750
two functions right
all right define pay attention

188
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
all right define pay attention
 

189
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,030
all right define pay attention
increasing and then you tell me how to

190
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
increasing and then you tell me how to
 

191
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,830
increasing and then you tell me how to
write yes

192
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
write yes
 

193
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,750
write yes
this is num num so now i need to check

194
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
this is num num so now i need to check
 

195
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,030
this is num num so now i need to check
for

196
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
for
 

197
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,710
for
what i need to index from here to here

198
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
what i need to index from here to here
 

199
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,310
what i need to index from here to here
what's the index for i in range

200
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320

 

201
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,270

the length will be length lumps

202
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
the length will be length lumps
 

203
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,670
the length will be length lumps
minus one minus one remember we are up

204
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
minus one minus one remember we are up
 

205
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,390
minus one minus one remember we are up
to here

206
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
to here
 

207
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,430
to here
yeah why does seven over n and

208
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
yeah why does seven over n and
 

209
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,950
yeah why does seven over n and
and then look if

210
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
and then look if
 

211
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,710
and then look if
none current numbers which is i

212
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
none current numbers which is i
 

213
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,390
none current numbers which is i
yeah this will be increasing then if

214
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
yeah this will be increasing then if
 

215
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,909
yeah this will be increasing then if
if it's bigger right

216
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
if it's bigger right
 

217
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,950
if it's bigger right
if it's bigger than lungs what should i

218
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
if it's bigger than lungs what should i
 

219
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,270
if it's bigger than lungs what should i
put

220
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
put
 

221
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,870
put
here if this dance i

222
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
here if this dance i
 

223
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,390
here if this dance i
is bigger than this way so what's what's

224
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
is bigger than this way so what's what's
 

225
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,990
is bigger than this way so what's what's
your happen here three

226
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
your happen here three
 

227
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,990
your happen here three
this is i and what's what should i put

228
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
this is i and what's what should i put
 

229
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,830
this is i and what's what should i put
here your index

230
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
here your index
 

231
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,469
here your index
it's next next something dot next

232
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
it's next next something dot next
 

233
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,990
it's next next something dot next
i dynamics i plus one come on

234
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000

 

235
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,749

if this number is bigger than that it's

236
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
if this number is bigger than that it's
 

237
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,350
if this number is bigger than that it's
not an i

238
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
not an i
 

239
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,749
not an i
it's not a monotony increasing so what

240
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
it's not a monotony increasing so what
 

241
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,670
it's not a monotony increasing so what
should i return

242
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
should i return
 

243
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:30,390
should i return
false

244
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400

 

245
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,029

okay now if i change this function to

246
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
okay now if i change this function to
 

247
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,670
okay now if i change this function to
mono

248
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
mono
 

249
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,270
mono
to this squeezing look

250
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
to this squeezing look
 

251
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,270
to this squeezing look
if i change this to the squeezing and

252
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
if i change this to the squeezing and
 

253
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,790
if i change this to the squeezing and
then do you

254
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
then do you
 

255
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,629
then do you
can you tell me what should i do to make

256
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
can you tell me what should i do to make
 

257
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,150
can you tell me what should i do to make
this function work

258
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
this function work
 

259
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,790
this function work
if i want to check if it's decreasing

260
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
if i want to check if it's decreasing
 

261
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,430
if i want to check if it's decreasing
yes

262
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
yes
 

263
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,629
yes
uh could that be

264
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
uh could that be
 

265
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,830
uh could that be
opposite way which is

266
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
opposite way which is
 

267
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,189
opposite way which is
small yeah okay so

268
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
small yeah okay so
 

269
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,870
small yeah okay so
what's the time complexity of this

270
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
what's the time complexity of this
 

271
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,309
what's the time complexity of this
function

272
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
function
 

273
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,110
function
yeah yes but you need to go through this

274
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
yeah yes but you need to go through this
 

275
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,790
yeah yes but you need to go through this
array twice right

276
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
array twice right
 

277
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,909
array twice right
yes because the first time every first

278
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
yes because the first time every first
 

279
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,350
yes because the first time every first
time you go through to check if it's

280
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
time you go through to check if it's
 

281
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,710
time you go through to check if it's
increasing and the second time goes

282
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
increasing and the second time goes
 

283
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,990
increasing and the second time goes
through to check it with this squeezing

284
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
through to check it with this squeezing
 

285
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,790
through to check it with this squeezing
right

286
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
right
 

287
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,189
right
yeah okay can we do better

288
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
yeah okay can we do better
 

289
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,990
yeah okay can we do better
can we can we do it in one pass

290
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
can we can we do it in one pass
 

291
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,430
can we can we do it in one pass
so how about look define look

292
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
so how about look define look
 

293
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,670
so how about look define look
okay i write the code and you tell me

294
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
okay i write the code and you tell me
 

295
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,550
okay i write the code and you tell me
how

296
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
how
 

297
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,830
how
how it works okay look monotonous

298
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:32,840
how it works okay look monotonous
 

299
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,950
how it works okay look monotonous
monitor just monotonic monotonic

300
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
monitor just monotonic monotonic
 

301
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,390
monitor just monotonic monotonic
lungs okay and then now look

302
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
lungs okay and then now look
 

303
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,909
lungs okay and then now look
magic yeah look increasing

304
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919

 

305
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,270

equals to decreasing

306
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280

 

307
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,469

equals two

308
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479

 

309
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,589

that's the fact okay and then for

310
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
that's the fact okay and then for
 

311
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,950
that's the fact okay and then for
i in range this is the same

312
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
i in range this is the same
 

313
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,550
i in range this is the same
same thing lens numbs

314
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
same thing lens numbs
 

315
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,070
same thing lens numbs
minus one right okay look

316
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
minus one right okay look
 

317
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,670
minus one right okay look
if lamps

318
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680

 

319
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,469

pay attention okay

320
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479

 

321
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,110

if numbs i bigger than num

322
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
if numbs i bigger than num
 

323
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,189
if numbs i bigger than num
i plus one if this number is bigger than

324
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
i plus one if this number is bigger than
 

325
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:27,589
i plus one if this number is bigger than
that

326
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
that
 

327
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,589
that
then it's not increasing right the

328
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
then it's not increasing right the
 

329
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,909
then it's not increasing right the
return focus no no no

330
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
return focus no no no
 

331
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,950
return focus no no no
increasing i set it to false right

332
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
increasing i set it to false right
 

333
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,550
increasing i set it to false right
because current number is bigger than

334
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
because current number is bigger than
 

335
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,189
because current number is bigger than
the next one so the increasing will be

336
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
the next one so the increasing will be
 

337
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:39,909
the next one so the increasing will be
false right

338
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
false right
 

339
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:52,469
false right
it must not be increasing yeah yeah

340
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479

 

341
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,430

i minus what i plus one if the current

342
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
i minus what i plus one if the current
 

343
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,950
i minus what i plus one if the current
number is smaller than the

344
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
number is smaller than the
 

345
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,909
number is smaller than the
next number then the decreasing is not

346
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
next number then the decreasing is not
 

347
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:00,869
next number then the decreasing is not
false yeah

348
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
false yeah
 

349
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,909
false yeah
all right all right

350
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
all right all right
 

351
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,520
all right all right
yeah you can air is equal is false

352
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:06,530
yeah you can air is equal is false
 

353
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,990
yeah you can air is equal is false

and then what should i return here

356
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
and then what should i return here
 

357
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,670
and then what should i return here
return

358
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
return
 

359
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,670
return
no oh look at these two numbers

360
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
no oh look at these two numbers
 

361
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,270
no oh look at these two numbers
two flags look in return what

362
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
two flags look in return what
 

363
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,550
two flags look in return what
what or what guess

364
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
what or what guess
 

365
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,510
what or what guess
increasing or decreasing yes we're

366
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520

 

367
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,749

why is that can you tell me how how this

368
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
why is that can you tell me how how this
 

369
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,949
why is that can you tell me how how this
work

370
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959

 

371
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,670

so we assume make the assumption that

372
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
so we assume make the assumption that
 

373
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,310
so we assume make the assumption that
it's e

374
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
it's e
 

375
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,870
it's e
is both increasing and both disgracing

376
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
is both increasing and both disgracing
 

377
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,750
is both increasing and both disgracing
right

378
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
right
 

379
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,870
right
yeah but once we find an opposite

380
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
yeah but once we find an opposite
 

381
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,230
yeah but once we find an opposite
case we say to false right we set it to

382
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
case we say to false right we set it to
 

383
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,110
case we say to false right we set it to
first

384
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
first
 

385
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,430
first
and after going through this one time

386
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
and after going through this one time
 

387
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,190
and after going through this one time
then

388
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
then
 

389
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,350
then
if it's not set to false if we still

390
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
if it's not set to false if we still
 

391
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,430
if it's not set to false if we still
true then it's increasing or if it's

392
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
true then it's increasing or if it's
 

393
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,870
true then it's increasing or if it's
equation reset two is

00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
equation reset two is
 

395
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,910
equation reset two is
still decreasing yeah can do do you

396
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
still decreasing yeah can do do you
 

397
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,550
still decreasing yeah can do do you
understand

398
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
understand
 

399
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,389
understand
yeah can you repeat can you say

400
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399

 

401
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,000

no

402
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,010

um if

406
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
um if
 

407
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,070
um if
if if it's bigger than it

408
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
if if it's bigger than it
 

409
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,509
if if it's bigger than it
is smaller return false not return force

410
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
is smaller return false not return force
 

411
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,269
is smaller return false not return force
here is just setting to force not

412
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
here is just setting to force not
 

413
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,710
here is just setting to force not
returning all

414
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
returning all
 

415
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,150
returning all
okay then

416
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160

 

417
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,670

so we make an assumption how about

418
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
so we make an assumption how about
 

419
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,070
so we make an assumption how about
how about if i if you just look at one

420
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
how about if i if you just look at one
 

421
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,870
how about if i if you just look at one
increasing i

422
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
increasing i
 

423
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,509
increasing i
i assume the array is not only

424
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
i assume the array is not only
 

425
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:49,990
i assume the array is not only
increasing

426
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
increasing
 

427
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,110
increasing
right and now if i first

428
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
right and now if i first
 

429
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,030
right and now if i first
find a place that this number is bigger

430
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
find a place that this number is bigger
 

431
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,190
find a place that this number is bigger
than the next number then it must not be

432
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
than the next number then it must not be
 

433
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,630
than the next number then it must not be
increasing right

434
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
increasing right
 

435
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,790
increasing right
yes

436
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:02,800

 

437
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,630

it's the same goes for the decreasing if

438
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
it's the same goes for the decreasing if
 

439
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,990
it's the same goes for the decreasing if
i assume it is

440
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
i assume it is
 

441
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,710
i assume it is
decreasing but i found the number

442
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
decreasing but i found the number
 

443
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,550
decreasing but i found the number
current number is smaller than the next

444
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
current number is smaller than the next
 

445
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,710
current number is smaller than the next
number then it must not be decreasing

446
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
number then it must not be decreasing
 

447
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,829
number then it must not be decreasing
i'm right

448
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
i'm right
 

449
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,550
i'm right
yeah and if i go through this number of

450
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
yeah and if i go through this number of
 

451
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,269
yeah and if i go through this number of
numbers

452
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
numbers
 

453
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,509
numbers
once and if the increasing is still true

454
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
once and if the increasing is still true
 

455
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,670
once and if the increasing is still true
then it's increasing monetary increasing

456
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
then it's increasing monetary increasing
 

457
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,430
then it's increasing monetary increasing
if that decreasing is still true it's

458
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
if that decreasing is still true it's
 

459
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,509
if that decreasing is still true it's
more than decreasing

460
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
more than decreasing
 

461
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,990
more than decreasing
okay right something or something this

462
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
okay right something or something this
 

463
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,110
okay right something or something this
is all

464
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
is all
 

465
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,230
is all
okay what's all okay

466
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
okay what's all okay
 

467
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,470
okay what's all okay
oh it could be that one okay

468
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
oh it could be that one okay
 

469
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,310
oh it could be that one okay
oh two is what two or three

470
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
oh two is what two or three
 

471
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,350
oh two is what two or three
two two or

472
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
two two or
 

473
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,870
two two or
two or four is one both

474
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
two or four is one both
 

475
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,750
two or four is one both
two or fours finally look this is the

476
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
two or fours finally look this is the
 

477
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,710
two or fours finally look this is the
binary

478
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
binary
 

479
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,910
binary
binary operator two or fours three two

480
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
binary operator two or fours three two
 

481
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,110
binary operator two or fours three two
three

482
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
three
 

483
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,350
three
two two of us is two it's two okay

484
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
two two of us is two it's two okay
 

485
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,350
two two of us is two it's two okay
first or fourth is doubles

486
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
first or fourth is doubles
 

487
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,470
first or fourth is doubles
for a fourth thing that's it yeah fourth

488
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
for a fourth thing that's it yeah fourth
 

489
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,030
for a fourth thing that's it yeah fourth
or two

490
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
or two
 

491
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,190
or two
it's false false are true

492
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,200
it's false false are true
 

493
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,190
it's false false are true
true so for the binary or is that one of

494
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
true so for the binary or is that one of
 

495
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,470
true so for the binary or is that one of
one of at least one of it is two

496
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
one of at least one of it is two
 

497
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,710
one of at least one of it is two
then is two right yeah you got it okay

498
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
then is two right yeah you got it okay
 

499
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,990
then is two right yeah you got it okay
so how about another one

500
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
so how about another one
 

501
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:37,030
so how about another one
n what's n mean

502
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040

 

503
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,230

okay okay two and four

504
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
okay okay two and four
 

505
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,990
okay okay two and four
a three fourth

506
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
a three fourth
 

507
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,430
a three fourth
fourth and two

508
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440

 

509
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,550

fourth and fourth

510
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560

 

511
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,269

so for this n that both sides must be

512
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
so for this n that both sides must be

very important look
 

541
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,509
very important look
increasing that that's what it means one

542
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
increasing that that's what it means one
 

543
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,870
increasing that that's what it means one
of one of them is

544
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
of one of them is
 

545
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,150
of one of them is
two that's two okay got it yeah this is

546
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,160
two that's two okay got it yeah this is
 

547
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,190
two that's two okay got it yeah this is
finally and

548
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
finally and
 

549
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,550
finally and
all and how but not not not

550
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
all and how but not not not
 

551
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,069
all and how but not not not
is a single it's not it's a unary

552
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
is a single it's not it's a unary
 

553
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,110
is a single it's not it's a unary
you know unary so not

554
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
you know unary so not
 

555
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,990
you know unary so not
is this is binary you return you require

556
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
is this is binary you return you require
 

557
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,910
is this is binary you return you require
two things yeah two things a and b

558
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
two things yeah two things a and b
 

559
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,310
two things yeah two things a and b
yeah a or b yeah but it's not

560
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
yeah a or b yeah but it's not
 

561
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,750
yeah a or b yeah but it's not
not it's just one so not a so like

562
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
not it's just one so not a so like
 

563
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,949
not it's just one so not a so like
not two equals one

564
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
not two equals one
 

565
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,110
not two equals one
false false not false

566
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
false false not false
 

567
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,150
false false not false
two yeah we're done okay so that's unary

568
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
two yeah we're done okay so that's unary
 

569
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,430
two yeah we're done okay so that's unary
you know unary

570
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
you know unary
 

571
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,790
you know unary
yeah one one binary two

572
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
yeah one one binary two
 

573
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,750
yeah one one binary two
okay and then also there there's a

574
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
okay and then also there there's a
 

575
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,470
okay and then also there there's a
tendering

576
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
tendering
 

577
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,509
tendering
ternary this is three

578
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
ternary this is three
 

579
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,350
ternary this is three
timer three okay we'll talk about it

580
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
timer three okay we'll talk about it
 

581
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,110
timer three okay we'll talk about it
later but you first of all you need to

582
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
later but you first of all you need to
 

583
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,030
later but you first of all you need to
know

584
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
know
 

585
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,389
know
no no a and b two this is more important

586
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
no no a and b two this is more important
 

587
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,030
no no a and b two this is more important
than two

588
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
than two
 

589
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,389
than two
not okay and another one okay the last

590
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
not okay and another one okay the last
 

591
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,509
not okay and another one okay the last
one

592
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
one
 

593
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,790
one
which you have a guess xor

594
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:32,800
which you have a guess xor
 

595
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,069
which you have a guess xor
exclusive o x or what

596
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
exclusive o x or what
 

597
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,910
exclusive o x or what
x or y exclusive o

598
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920

 

599
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,910

okay look two x or

600
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
okay look two x or
 

601
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,350
okay look two x or
two equals four okay

602
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
two equals four okay
 

603
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,389
two equals four okay
2 x or 4 equals

604
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
2 x or 4 equals
 

605
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,590
2 x or 4 equals
right fourth x of 2

606
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
right fourth x of 2
 

607
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,790
right fourth x of 2
equals 2 and then fourth

608
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
equals 2 and then fourth
 

609
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,069
equals 2 and then fourth
xor 4 equals 4. so can you tell me

610
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
xor 4 equals 4. so can you tell me
 

611
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,470
xor 4 equals 4. so can you tell me
what's the principle here okay

612
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:04,480
what's the principle here okay
 

613
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,990
what's the principle here okay
oh if if they're both the same it's

614
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
oh if if they're both the same it's
 

615
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,710
oh if if they're both the same it's
false

616
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
false
 

617
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,750
false
if if they're different it's true well

618
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
if if they're different it's true well
 

619
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,829
if if they're different it's true well
done yeah let's exclusively okay

620
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
done yeah let's exclusively okay
 

621
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,590
done yeah let's exclusively okay
we're done very well done

622
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600

 

623
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:30,310

okay for today

624
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
okay for today
 

625
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,160
okay for today
yeah okay that's it
