you reverse the center uh words not the
 

43
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,750
you reverse the center uh words not the
characters okay it's not like like that

00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
characters okay it's not like like that
 

45
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,790
characters okay it's not like like that
ryan and then you reverse the

46
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
ryan and then you reverse the
 

47
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,709
ryan and then you reverse the
characters you'll be n-a-y-r right

48
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
characters you'll be n-a-y-r right
 

49
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,670
characters you'll be n-a-y-r right
okay so did you see it yeah what's the

50
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
okay so did you see it yeah what's the
 

51
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,030
okay so did you see it yeah what's the
word

52
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
word
 

53
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:22,630
word
eric and rice

54
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640

 

55
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:32,870

so we start on this letter b

56
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880

 

57
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,830

how do we go to the next words we need

58
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
how do we go to the next words we need
 

59
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,469
how do we go to the next words we need
to

60
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
to
 

61
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,149
to
find this space right yes so okay

62
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
find this space right yes so okay
 

63
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,190
find this space right yes so okay
so in python remember we have a very

64
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
so in python remember we have a very
 

65
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,910
so in python remember we have a very
useful

66
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
useful
 

67
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,550
useful
function which is called split split

68
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
function which is called split split
 

69
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,389
function which is called split split
space spread what's split

70
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399

 

71
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,510

just what what is this yeah just to make

72
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
just what what is this yeah just to make
 

73
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,389
just what what is this yeah just to make
it apart yeah

74
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
it apart yeah
 

75
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,870
it apart yeah
yeah and then you can take a parameter

76
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
yeah and then you can take a parameter
 

77
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,429
yeah and then you can take a parameter
then if you put a

78
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
then if you put a
 

79
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,550
then if you put a
it'd be three minutes you put a space it

80
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
it'd be three minutes you put a space it
 

81
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:04,870
it'd be three minutes you put a space it
means

82
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
means
 

83
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,070
means
i split by space so look if this is s

84
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
i split by space so look if this is s
 

85
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,949
i split by space so look if this is s
yeah look this is a string and then if i

86
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
yeah look this is a string and then if i
 

87
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,070
yeah look this is a string and then if i
say split

88
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
say split
 

89
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,390
say split
stop split a you should do a

90
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
stop split a you should do a
 

91
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,510
stop split a you should do a
let's let's okay if s is a string s dot

92
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
let's let's okay if s is a string s dot
 

93
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,190
let's let's okay if s is a string s dot
split

94
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
split
 

95
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,910
split
space the way it becomes you you will

96
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
space the way it becomes you you will
 

97
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,710
space the way it becomes you you will
split the

98
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
split the
 

99
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,790
split the
sentence string by this denominator yes

100
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
sentence string by this denominator yes
 

101
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,070
sentence string by this denominator yes
the limiter what what does it mean

102
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
the limiter what what does it mean
 

103
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,309
the limiter what what does it mean
delimiter by this thing you're given

104
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
delimiter by this thing you're given
 

105
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,949
delimiter by this thing you're given
into a list so you become a list yeah

106
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
into a list so you become a list yeah
 

107
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,550
into a list so you become a list yeah
bracket

108
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
bracket
 

109
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,390
bracket
and eric come out

110
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
and eric come out
 

111
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,710
and eric come out
and come on and ryan

112
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
and come on and ryan
 

113
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,830
and come on and ryan
okay that's me yeah

114
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
okay that's me yeah
 

115
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,949
okay that's me yeah
yeah that's me uh

116
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
yeah that's me uh
 

117
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,830
yeah that's me uh
okay so there might be a small problem

118
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
okay so there might be a small problem
 

119
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,390
okay so there might be a small problem
which is

120
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
which is
 

121
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,990
which is
s string is not

122
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
s string is not
 

123
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,990
s string is not
yeah you can spread the string yeah and

124
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
yeah you can spread the string yeah and
 

125
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,149
yeah you can spread the string yeah and
by this will become this yeah

126
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
by this will become this yeah
 

127
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,869
by this will become this yeah
yeah yeah yeah and then you just need to

128
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
yeah yeah yeah and then you just need to
 

129
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,470
yeah yeah yeah and then you just need to
reverse this part

130
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
reverse this part
 

131
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,910
reverse this part
and first reverse this part how do we

132
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
and first reverse this part how do we
 

133
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,869
and first reverse this part how do we
reverse that

134
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
reverse that
 

135
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,869
reverse that
hold with the list reverse this bit

136
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
hold with the list reverse this bit
 

137
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,309
hold with the list reverse this bit
and then another the opposite so how do

138
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
and then another the opposite so how do
 

139
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,830
and then another the opposite so how do
we do the opposite from the

140
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
we do the opposite from the
 

141
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,070
we do the opposite from the
lead to the string for example at least

142
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
lead to the string for example at least
 

143
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,509
lead to the string for example at least
i want to conver i want to

144
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
i want to conver i want to
 

145
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,710
i want to conver i want to
make it back to eric and ryan so if this

146
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
make it back to eric and ryan so if this
 

147
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,030
make it back to eric and ryan so if this
is

148
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
is
 

149
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,229
is
uh a okay if this is an array

150
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
uh a okay if this is an array
 

151
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,670
uh a okay if this is an array
a so how can we make this back to this

152
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
a so how can we make this back to this
 

153
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,190
a so how can we make this back to this
we can use this space a space yeah this

154
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
we can use this space a space yeah this
 

155
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,270
we can use this space a space yeah this
is a space

156
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
is a space
 

157
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,470
is a space
join a that's

158
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
join a that's
 

159
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,110
join a that's
it so what does it mean it means that i

160
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
it so what does it mean it means that i
 

161
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,030
it so what does it mean it means that i
want to join

162
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
want to join
 

163
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,390
want to join
the elements in a list

164
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
the elements in a list
 

165
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,070
the elements in a list
by a space

166
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080

so this way you you you will make a
 

171
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,990
so this way you you you will make a
string

172
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
string
 

173
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,509
string
based on a list by its delimiter

174
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
based on a list by its delimiter
 

175
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,229
based on a list by its delimiter
and this this direction you split a

176
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
and this this direction you split a
 

177
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,270
and this this direction you split a
string

178
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
string
 

179
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,469
string
into an array of strings

180
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
into an array of strings
 

181
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,749
into an array of strings
by using this split function okay so

182
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759

 

183
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,469

what's the complexity no no no yeah okay

184
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
what's the complexity no no no yeah okay
 

185
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,590
what's the complexity no no no yeah okay
so now

186
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
so now
 

187
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,230
so now
i can do this i can do this okay so

188
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
i can do this i can do this okay so
 

189
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,590
i can do this i can do this okay so
let's do this okay

190
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
let's do this okay
 

191
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,430
let's do this okay
i can show you okay so

192
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440

 

193
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,950

for example if we want to reverse the

194
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
for example if we want to reverse the
 

195
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,790
for example if we want to reverse the
string how do we reverse string

196
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
string how do we reverse string
 

197
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,710
string how do we reverse string
there's an agreement to do it

198
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720

 

199
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,390

look look look it does become the front

200
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
look look look it does become the front
 

201
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,990
look look look it does become the front
look if this is the remember the reverse

202
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
look if this is the remember the reverse
 

203
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,469
look if this is the remember the reverse
string

204
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
string
 

205
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,629
string
we are using the reverse string we can

206
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
we are using the reverse string we can
 

207
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,909
we are using the reverse string we can
use reverse to check if a string is a

208
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
use reverse to check if a string is a
 

209
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,909
use reverse to check if a string is a
panning drum yeah because it's spelled

210
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
panning drum yeah because it's spelled
 

211
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,590
panning drum yeah because it's spelled
backwards like race guys better

212
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
backwards like race guys better
 

213
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,749
backwards like race guys better
it's also let's go yeah yeah okay so

214
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
it's also let's go yeah yeah okay so
 

215
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,029
it's also let's go yeah yeah okay so
lease

216
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039

 

217
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,070

a b c d e okay we want to

218
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
a b c d e okay we want to
 

219
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,590
a b c d e okay we want to
we want to reverse this speed it will

220
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
we want to reverse this speed it will
 

221
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,749
we want to reverse this speed it will
become e d

222
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
become e d
 

223
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,670
become e d
a okay yes how can we do it

224
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
a okay yes how can we do it
 

225
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,749
a okay yes how can we do it
we just we just move the

226
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
we just we just move the
 

227
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,110
we just we just move the
last one to the beginning so that last

228
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
last one to the beginning so that last
 

229
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,310
last one to the beginning so that last
one to the beginning and then how do we

230
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
one to the beginning and then how do we
 

231
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,790
one to the beginning and then how do we
do it

232
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
do it
 

233
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,230
do it
from the beginning one to the end then

234
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
from the beginning one to the end then
 

235
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,430
from the beginning one to the end then
the second beginning one okay so

236
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
the second beginning one okay so
 

237
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,350
the second beginning one okay so
yeah you mentioned a very good point

238
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
yeah you mentioned a very good point
 

239
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,790
yeah you mentioned a very good point
which is to

240
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
which is to
 

241
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,150
which is to
look look i have two pointer yeah

242
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
look look i have two pointer yeah
 

243
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,430
look look i have two pointer yeah
yeah yeah yeah ryan look line look i

244
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
yeah yeah yeah ryan look line look i
 

245
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,710
yeah yeah yeah ryan look line look i
have two pointer

246
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
have two pointer
 

247
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,950
have two pointer
i swap to these two yeah so you become

248
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
i swap to these two yeah so you become
 

249
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,390
i swap to these two yeah so you become
b a e a and then i move it closer one

250
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
b a e a and then i move it closer one
 

251
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,510
b a e a and then i move it closer one
step

252
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
step
 

253
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,270
step
closer yeah yeah yeah yeah and i swap

254
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
closer yeah yeah yeah yeah and i swap
 

255
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,870
closer yeah yeah yeah yeah and i swap
these two you'll become t and you become

256
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
these two you'll become t and you become
 

257
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,909
these two you'll become t and you become
what b and i move it and then meeting

258
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
what b and i move it and then meeting
 

259
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:02,550
what b and i move it and then meeting
the meter

260
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
the meter
 

261
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,469
the meter
that's it you see does it work yeah

262
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
that's it you see does it work yeah
 

263
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,110
that's it you see does it work yeah
i have two points and both ends i

264
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
i have two points and both ends i
 

265
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,909
i have two points and both ends i
swapped

266
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
swapped
 

267
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,550
swapped
i swapped the elements at both ends and

268
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
i swapped the elements at both ends and
 

269
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,670
i swapped the elements at both ends and
then i did

270
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
then i did
 

271
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,110
then i did
and then i move move one step closer to

272
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
and then i move move one step closer to
 

273
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,110
and then i move move one step closer to
each other until i meet in the middle

274
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
each other until i meet in the middle
 

275
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,510
each other until i meet in the middle
which

276
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
which
 

277
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,309
which
will be in the middle right yeah okay so

278
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
will be in the middle right yeah okay so
 

279
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:22,790
will be in the middle right yeah okay so
so

280
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
so
 

281
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,070
so
but interesting is in prison

282
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
but interesting is in prison
 

283
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,590
but interesting is in prison
the s is c the string are

284
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
the s is c the string are
 

285
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,150
the s is c the string are
immutable so what do you mean by this

286
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
immutable so what do you mean by this
 

287
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,950
immutable so what do you mean by this
mean

288
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
mean
 

289
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,230
mean
immediately what does it mean means he

290
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
immediately what does it mean means he
 

291
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,830
immediately what does it mean means he
can't talk

292
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
can't talk
 

293
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,590
can't talk
no no no mutable what does mutable mean

294
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
no no no mutable what does mutable mean
 

295
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,230

change it can be chain immutable means

296
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
change it can be chain immutable means
 

297
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,749
change it can be chain immutable means
it can't be changed

298

it can't be changed
 

299
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,230
it can't be changed
so what does it mean like if it is a

300
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
so what does it mean like if it is a
 

301
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,430
so what does it mean like if it is a
string eric eric

if you ask a string right s
 

305
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,990
if you ask a string right s
0 will be f e yeah

306
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
0 will be f e yeah
 

307
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,950
0 will be f e yeah
will be equal to e right yes

308
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960

 

309
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,830

assign a value but you can't do it in
person okay

338
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
person okay
 

339
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,230
person okay
yes you can better so how so

340
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
yes you can better so how so
 

341
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,510
yes you can better so how so
so we can only in zoom yeah you can't

342
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
so we can only in zoom yeah you can't
 

343
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,070
so we can only in zoom yeah you can't
talk

344
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
talk
 

345
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,110
talk
yeah yeah look if s is the string now we

346
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
yeah yeah look if s is the string now we
 

347
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,510
yeah yeah look if s is the string now we
can convert it to

348
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
can convert it to
 

349
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,430
can convert it to
array right let's say array equals

350
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
array right let's say array equals
 

351
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,790
array right let's say array equals
list list s

352
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
list list s
 

353
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,830
list list s
then you will become a character

354
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
then you will become a character
 

355
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,950
then you will become a character
when you do this the f a will become

356
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
when you do this the f a will become
 

357
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,909
when you do this the f a will become
what

358
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
what
 

359
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,029
what
it will become like that e ah

360
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
it will become like that e ah
 

361
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,390
it will become like that e ah
a single letter y c i c and

362
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
a single letter y c i c and
 

363
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,790
a single letter y c i c and
and then now you can this is mutable you

364
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
and then now you can this is mutable you
 

365
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,670
and then now you can this is mutable you
it means you can't

366
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
it means you can't
 

367
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,469
it means you can't
you can change it right yeah okay so now

368
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
you can change it right yeah okay so now
 

369
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:16,869
you can change it right yeah okay so now
i'm going

370
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
i'm going
 

371
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,749
i'm going
i'm going to do uh i'm i'm going to talk

372
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
i'm going to do uh i'm i'm going to talk
 

373
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,390
i'm going to do uh i'm i'm going to talk
about

374
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
about
 

375
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,430
about
if we if it's uh okay that's okay

376
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
if we if it's uh okay that's okay
 

377
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,749
if we if it's uh okay that's okay
if n a is at least reason how can we

378
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
if n a is at least reason how can we
 

379
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,790
if n a is at least reason how can we
change it so

380
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
change it so
 

381
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,309
change it so
look

382
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319

 

383
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,389

so define reverse let's just reverse

384
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
so define reverse let's just reverse
 

385
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,750
so define reverse let's just reverse
s from i to j yeah

386
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
s from i to j yeah
 

387
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,709
s from i to j yeah
if s is at least yeah if s is released

388
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
if s is at least yeah if s is released
 

389
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,909
if s is at least yeah if s is released
then we can store this

390
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
then we can store this
 

391
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,110
then we can store this
y i is smaller than j

392
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
y i is smaller than j
 

393
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,750
y i is smaller than j
column yeah and i want to solve the

394
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
column yeah and i want to solve the
 

395
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,750
column yeah and i want to solve the
position from i to j yeah so

396
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
position from i to j yeah so
 

397
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,430
position from i to j yeah so
s i s j

398
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
s i s j
 

399
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,870
s i s j
equals as they as i

400
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
equals as they as i
 

401
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,910
equals as they as i
okay you see s-i-s-j

402
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:00,920
okay you see s-i-s-j
 

403
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,230
okay you see s-i-s-j
s-i-s-j equals s-j-s-i

404
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
s-i-s-j equals s-j-s-i
 

405
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,670
s-i-s-j equals s-j-s-i
okay so it means to swap it and then i

406
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
okay so it means to swap it and then i
 

407
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,590
okay so it means to swap it and then i
plus equals one and then

408
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
plus equals one and then
 

409
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,630
plus equals one and then
what should i do with j

410
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
what should i do with j
 

411
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,990
what should i do with j
uh i is on the left s

412
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
uh i is on the left s
 

413
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,630
uh i is on the left s
in i is on the left j is here i plus

414
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
in i is on the left j is here i plus
 

415
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,070
in i is on the left j is here i plus
equals one i move

416
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
equals one i move
 

417
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,910
equals one i move
one step to the right and how what's

418
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
one step to the right and how what's
 

419
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,190
one step to the right and how what's
your idea with zayn

420
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
your idea with zayn
 

421
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,710
your idea with zayn
yay minus equals one well done

422
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
yay minus equals one well done
 

423
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,870
yay minus equals one well done
brilliant that's what i want yes and

424
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
brilliant that's what i want yes and
 

425
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,550
brilliant that's what i want yes and
when i meet in the middle

426
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
when i meet in the middle
 

427
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,269
when i meet in the middle
that's it let's swap it yeah stop it

428
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
that's it let's swap it yeah stop it
 

429
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,110
that's it let's swap it yeah stop it
yeah good thing

430
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
yeah good thing
 

431
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,190
yeah good thing
okay so in person we don't need to

432
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
okay so in person we don't need to
 

433
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,389
okay so in person we don't need to
reinvent that

434
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
reinvent that
 

435
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,550
reinvent that
yeah we can just do this in person

436
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
yeah we can just do this in person
 

437
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,829
yeah we can just do this in person
we can just do this i want to reverse it

438
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
we can just do this i want to reverse it
 

439
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,350
we can just do this i want to reverse it
all right

440
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
all right
 

441
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,750
all right
i want to reverse it either is a string

442
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
i want to reverse it either is a string
 

443
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,269
i want to reverse it either is a string
or this i can just do this

444
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
or this i can just do this
 

445
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,230
or this i can just do this
s and i can just use this one here

446
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
s and i can just use this one here
 

447
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,230
s and i can just use this one here
reverse

448
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
reverse
 

449
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,990
reverse
reversed s then you become reverse let's

450
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
reversed s then you become reverse let's
 

451
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,790
reversed s then you become reverse let's
say

452
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
say
 

453
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,230
say
or alternatively you can do this or

454
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
or alternatively you can do this or
 

455
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,630
or alternatively you can do this or
automatically you can just do this as

456
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
automatically you can just do this as
 

457
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,910
automatically you can just do this as
bracket

458
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920

 

459
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,949

column minus one

460
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
column minus one
 

461
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,150
column minus one
okay so

462
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,160

 

463
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,870

minus one so it means double column

464
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
minus one so it means double column
 

465
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,590
minus one so it means double column
minus one

466
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
minus one
 

467
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,389
minus one
means to reverse it it's a reverse

468
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
means to reverse it it's a reverse
 

469
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,110
means to reverse it it's a reverse
version

470
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
version
 

471
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,230
version
of s right

472
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
of s right
 

473
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,150
of s right
yes so

474
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
yes so
 

475
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,069
yes so
and one way of doing it first of all

476
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
and one way of doing it first of all
 

477
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,790
and one way of doing it first of all
a more complicated approach is to

478
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
a more complicated approach is to
 

479
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,310
a more complicated approach is to
reverse this by

480
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
reverse this by
 

481
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,350
reverse this by
letters so reverse this letter will be

482
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
letters so reverse this letter will be
 

483
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:56,550
letters so reverse this letter will be
you'll be one and a y r

484
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560

 

485
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,910

and then the second step is to reverse

486
00:10:59,910 --> 00:10:59,920
and then the second step is to reverse
 

487
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,790
and then the second step is to reverse
the words

488
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
the words
 

489
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,550
the words
so this will become ryan

490
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
so this will become ryan
 

491
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,509
so this will become ryan
this will become and this will become

492
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
this will become and this will become
 

493
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,710
this will become and this will become
eric

494
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
eric
 

495
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,269
eric
yeah you see that's what we want yeah

496
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
yeah you see that's what we want yeah
 

497
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:11,750
yeah you see that's what we want yeah
right

498
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
right
 

499
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,140
right
you see yeah

500
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,150
you see yeah
 

501
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,670
you see yeah
