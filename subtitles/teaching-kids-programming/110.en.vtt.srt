parenting drum

12
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:11,280
parenting drum
 

13
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,470
parenting drum
it's a word that's spelled with

14
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
it's a word that's spelled with
 

15
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,800
it's a word that's spelled with
which is

16
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:22,810

 

17

[Music]

18
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039

 

19
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,990

so basically if i give you a raise

20
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
so basically if i give you a raise
 

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,670
so basically if i give you a raise
car and

22
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680
car and
 

23
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,750
car and
race car yeah so you need to tell me the

24
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
race car yeah so you need to tell me the
 

25
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,830
race car yeah so you need to tell me the
perpendicular i know how many number

26
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:39,840
perpendicular i know how many number
 

27
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,229
perpendicular i know how many number
of the parent one substrings

28
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
of the parent one substrings
 

29
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,910
of the parent one substrings
what's the substring so basically it's

30
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
what's the substring so basically it's
 

31
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,750
what's the substring so basically it's
continuous you know the subsequence is

32
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
continuous you know the subsequence is
 

33
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,069
continuous you know the subsequence is
that

34
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
that
 

35
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,110
that
you can you can jump you can skip right

36
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
you can you can jump you can skip right
 

37
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,990
you can you can jump you can skip right
but sub substring is not is that the

38
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
but sub substring is not is that the
 

39
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,549
but sub substring is not is that the
substring

40
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
substring
 

41
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,189
substring
look r is the circle i is a substring ac

42
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
look r is the circle i is a substring ac
 

43
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,069
look r is the circle i is a substring ac
is a string

44
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
is a string
 

45
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,069
is a string
ac is the subsequence so it needs to be

46
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
ac is the subsequence so it needs to be
 

47
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,470
ac is the subsequence so it needs to be
continuous piece

48
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
continuous piece
 

49
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,789
continuous piece
did you get it so that the current

50
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799
did you get it so that the current
 

51
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,149
did you get it so that the current
subsequence look

52
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
subsequence look
 

53
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,590
subsequence look
race car is a substance yeah yeah

54
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
race car is a substance yeah yeah
 

55
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,950
race car is a substance yeah yeah
and look c e c is a subsequence

56
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
and look c e c is a subsequence
 

57
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,030
and look c e c is a subsequence
yeah it's a parent of some substring

58
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
yeah it's a parent of some substring
 

59
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,990
yeah it's a parent of some substring
right

60
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
right
 

61
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,510
right
yeah and can we find any others no

62
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
yeah and can we find any others no
 

63
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,870
yeah and can we find any others no
no i think that's it oh and look

64
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
no i think that's it oh and look
 

65
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,190
no i think that's it oh and look
a c e c a look look a c e c a yeah

66
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
a c e c a look look a c e c a yeah
 

67
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,510
a c e c a look look a c e c a yeah
yeah okay can you find any other things

68
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
yeah okay can you find any other things
 

69
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,469
yeah okay can you find any other things
no

70
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
no
 

71
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,270
no
okay so yeah e and each one is a

72
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
okay so yeah e and each one is a
 

73
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,510
okay so yeah e and each one is a
parameter so each one r is a parameter

74
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
parameter so each one r is a parameter
 

75
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,230
parameter so each one r is a parameter
a c e c a r so we need to count how many

76
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
a c e c a r so we need to count how many
 

77
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,429
a c e c a r so we need to count how many
of them

78
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
of them
 

79
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,350
of them
right so for example this one you need

80
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
right so for example this one you need
 

81
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,990
right so for example this one you need
to tell me is there has to be a pillar

82
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
to tell me is there has to be a pillar
 

83
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,389
to tell me is there has to be a pillar
yeah it has look one two three four five

84
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
yeah it has look one two three four five
 

85
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,550
yeah it has look one two three four five
six seven okay seven

86
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
six seven okay seven
 

87
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,789
six seven okay seven
plus one two uh one

88
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
plus one two uh one
 

89
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,149
plus one two uh one
one yeah plus one

90
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
one yeah plus one
 

91
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,350
one yeah plus one
yeah and plus one so

92
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
yeah and plus one so
 

93
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,030
yeah and plus one so
it needs to it has ten percent

94
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
it needs to it has ten percent
 

95
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,429
it needs to it has ten percent
substrings what are they sorry

96
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
substrings what are they sorry
 

97
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,510
substrings what are they sorry
look seven is each letter yeah

98
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:10,520
look seven is each letter yeah
 

99
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,309
look seven is each letter yeah
r-a-c-e-c-a-r okay

100
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
r-a-c-e-c-a-r okay
 

101
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,390
r-a-c-e-c-a-r okay
one is a-c-e-c

102
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
one is a-c-e-c
 

103
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,670
one is a-c-e-c
a okay this is a parent another one

104
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
a okay this is a parent another one
 

105
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,470
a okay this is a parent another one
c-e-c another one race car

106
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
c-e-c another one race car
 

107
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,710
c-e-c another one race car
okay

108
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720

 

109
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,150

yeah i just counted r-a-c-e-c-a-r

110
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
yeah i just counted r-a-c-e-c-a-r
 

111
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,509
yeah i just counted r-a-c-e-c-a-r
yes they already counted one right

112
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
yes they already counted one right
 

113
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,589
yes they already counted one right
the one is already included in each one

114
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
the one is already included in each one
 

115
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,430
the one is already included in each one
yeah yeah so that's ten

116
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
yeah yeah so that's ten
 

117
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,430
yeah yeah so that's ten
or less tens of substrings okay

118
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
or less tens of substrings okay
 

119
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,670
or less tens of substrings okay
so how can we count it any idea

120
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680

 

121
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,910

if you're not sure the first thing you

122
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
if you're not sure the first thing you
 

123
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,390
if you're not sure the first thing you
need to think about is

124
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
need to think about is
 

125
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,550
need to think about is
oh if it's there's an even

126
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
oh if it's there's an even
 

127
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,750
oh if it's there's an even
number all you need to do

128
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
number all you need to do
 

129
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,869
number all you need to do
is you uh

130
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
is you uh
 

131
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,630
is you uh
you write it down yeah and yes divided

132
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
you write it down yeah and yes divided
 

133
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:08,949
you write it down yeah and yes divided
by

134
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
by
 

135
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,830
by
two and write and write what's it

136
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
two and write and write what's it
 

137
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,030
two and write and write what's it
divided by two

138
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
divided by two
 

139
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,550
divided by two
and then add it together

140
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
and then add it together
 

141
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,710
and then add it together
no you might not work for some strings i

142
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
no you might not work for some strings i
 

143
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,790
no you might not work for some strings i
mean the first first acronym you need to

144
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
mean the first first acronym you need to
 

145
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,430
mean the first first acronym you need to
think of

146
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
think of
 

147
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,270
think of
is what to do is the most stupid way

148
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
is what to do is the most stupid way
 

149
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,750
is what to do is the most stupid way
which is blue force right yeah so how

150
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
which is blue force right yeah so how
 

151
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,869
which is blue force right yeah so how
can we improve first

152
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
can we improve first
 

153
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,830
can we improve first
so the substring we can blue first use

154
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
so the substring we can blue first use
 

155
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,030
so the substring we can blue first use
no no subsequence is o to n right we are

156
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
no no subsequence is o to n right we are
 

157
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,070
no no subsequence is o to n right we are
talking about the

158
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
talking about the
 

159
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,710
talking about the
substring which is only how many

160
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
substring which is only how many
 

161
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,390
substring which is only how many
substrings can we have if

162
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
substrings can we have if
 

163
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,470
substrings can we have if
n look a b c how many substrings

164
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
n look a b c how many substrings
 

165
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,710
n look a b c how many substrings
abc how many substrings zero

166
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
abc how many substrings zero

c you see they're not jumps i know but

172
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
c you see they're not jumps i know but

i'm
 

175
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,190
i'm
talking about the number of the

176
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
talking about the number of the
 

177
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,070
talking about the number of the
substrings how many substrings

178
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080

 

179
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,149

how many substrings so basically if

180
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
how many substrings so basically if
 

181
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,509
how many substrings so basically if
there are n characters how many

182
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
there are n characters how many
 

183
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,949
there are n characters how many
substrings do we have

184
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
substrings do we have
 

185
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,270
substrings do we have
so if we define the left of the

186
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
so if we define the left of the
 

187
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,469
so if we define the left of the
substring is i

188
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
substring is i
 

189
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,030
substring is i
the right of the substring can be for

190
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
the right of the substring can be for
 

191
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,990
the right of the substring can be for
anything from i

192
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
anything from i
 

193
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,189
anything from i
to n right yes

194
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
to n right yes
 

195
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,230
to n right yes
all right yeah yeah so we can

196
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
all right yeah yeah so we can
 

197
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,270
all right yeah yeah so we can
some if we use in a for loop

198
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
some if we use in a for loop
 

199
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,430
some if we use in a for loop
for i in range look away

200
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
for i in range look away
 

201
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,950
for i in range look away
n and now we can do this for j

202
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
n and now we can do this for j
 

203
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,150
n and now we can do this for j
in range start from i

204
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
in range start from i
 

205
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,350
in range start from i
to n so and then we can get the

206
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
to n so and then we can get the
 

207
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,310
to n so and then we can get the
substring

208
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
substring
 

209
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,670
substring
between i to j yeah all right all right

210
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
between i to j yeah all right all right
 

211
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,390
between i to j yeah all right all right
all right

212
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
all right
 

213
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,870
all right
do you get it eric this is substring so

214
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
do you get it eric this is substring so
 

215
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,510
do you get it eric this is substring so
what's the complexity of these

216
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
what's the complexity of these
 

217
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,230
what's the complexity of these
what's the time complexity what's the

218
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
what's the time complexity what's the
 

219
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,870
what's the time complexity what's the
time cons

220
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
time cons
 

221
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,870
time cons
complexity if you see two ends two

222
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
complexity if you see two ends two
 

223
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,230
complexity if you see two ends two
fourths

224
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
fourths
 

225
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,790
fourths
until n square yeah we're done i said

226
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
until n square yeah we're done i said
 

227
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,270
until n square yeah we're done i said
that

228
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
that
 

229
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,629
that
okay so look look we need o n

230
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
okay so look look we need o n
 

231
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,830
okay so look look we need o n
square to find to iterate to

232
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
square to find to iterate to
 

233
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,790
square to find to iterate to
blue force no yeah to proof of all the

234
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
blue force no yeah to proof of all the
 

235
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,590
blue force no yeah to proof of all the
substrings

236
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
substrings
 

237
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,710
substrings
in o n 2 o n square and

238
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
in o n 2 o n square and
 

239
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,590
in o n 2 o n square and
given a string given a substring what's

240
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
given a string given a substring what's
 

241
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,390
given a string given a substring what's
the term complexity if you want to

242
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
the term complexity if you want to
 

243
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,350
the term complexity if you want to
we want to verify it is a apparent

244
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
we want to verify it is a apparent
 

245
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,310
we want to verify it is a apparent
journal what's the term complexity

246
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:31,320

 

247
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,629

[Music]

248
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
[Music]
 

249
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,150
[Music]
yes we are done so all together you'll

250
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
yes we are done so all together you'll
 

251
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,909
yes we are done so all together you'll
be all cubic right

252
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
be all cubic right
 

253
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,830
be all cubic right
yeah okay so should we draw this look

254
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
yeah okay so should we draw this look
 

255
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,510
yeah okay so should we draw this look
yeah n cubic yeah cubic

256
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
yeah n cubic yeah cubic
 

257
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,749
yeah n cubic yeah cubic
n three to the power three yeah power

258
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
n three to the power three yeah power
 

259
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,150
n three to the power three yeah power
and only three okay so define

260
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
and only three okay so define
 

261
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,990
and only three okay so define
s less than s what's missing column

262
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
s less than s what's missing column
 

263
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,469
s less than s what's missing column
okay so now let's call the answer equals

264
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
okay so now let's call the answer equals
 

265
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,749
okay so now let's call the answer equals
zero here right

266
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
zero here right
 

267
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,350
zero here right
okay for i in

268
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
okay for i in
 

269
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,550
okay for i in
range yes length

270
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560

right so what does it mean here it means

282
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
right so what does it mean here it means
 

283
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,110
right so what does it mean here it means
look i

284
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
look i
 

285
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,230
look i
love array i i determine

love array i i determine
 

287
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,710
love array i i determine
i and then i every time i have i and

i and then i every time i have i and
 

289
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,390
i and then i every time i have i and
then i loop it from

290
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
then i loop it from
 

291
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,230
then i loop it from
j will be from i to to to here yeah this

292
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
j will be from i to to to here yeah this
 

293
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,629
j will be from i to to to here yeah this
is i

294
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
is i
 

295
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,629
is i
and then this is j okay okay yes

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
s i i yes and column and y
 

335
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,830
s i i yes and column and y
minus one minus one there's j here you

336
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
minus one minus one there's j here you
 

337
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,070
minus one minus one there's j here you
want to use it

338
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
want to use it
 

339
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,589
want to use it
we only use it okay j plus one

340
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
we only use it okay j plus one
 

341
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,909
we only use it okay j plus one
j plus one look because this is from the

342
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
j plus one look because this is from the
 

343
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,710
j plus one look because this is from the
star

344
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
star
 

345
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,990
star
this is n remember n is always up to but

346
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
this is n remember n is always up to but
 

347
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,990
this is n remember n is always up to but
not including so we have the plus one am

348
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
not including so we have the plus one am
 

349
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,430
not including so we have the plus one am
right

350
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
right
 

351
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,550
right
do you get it look this is i and then j

352
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
do you get it look this is i and then j
 

353
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:48,950
do you get it look this is i and then j
will be

354
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
will be
 

355
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,510
will be
here and only i will be saying so every

356
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
here and only i will be saying so every
 

357
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,110
here and only i will be saying so every
time

358
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
time
 

359
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,629
time
if we iterate we will have n square

360
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
if we iterate we will have n square
 

361
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,350
if we iterate we will have n square
n substring right and look this is

362
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
n substring right and look this is
 

363
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,950
n substring right and look this is
substring and how can we check if it's

364
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
substring and how can we check if it's
 

365
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,230
substring and how can we check if it's
the reverse it's the same

366
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
the reverse it's the same
 

367
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,270
the reverse it's the same
look if sub

368
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
look if sub
 

369
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,670
look if sub
equals it's reverse we want to reverse

370
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
equals it's reverse we want to reverse
 

371
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,150
equals it's reverse we want to reverse
it how do we reverse this

372
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
it how do we reverse this
 

373
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,430
it how do we reverse this
remember we're using this syntax common

374
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
remember we're using this syntax common
 

375
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,430
remember we're using this syntax common
column minus one yeah remember this is

376
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
column minus one yeah remember this is
 

377
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:15,830
column minus one yeah remember this is
the

378
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
the
 

379
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,749
the
so we look us up column column minus one

380
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
so we look us up column column minus one
 

381
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,670
so we look us up column column minus one
means to reverse this stuff

382
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
means to reverse this stuff
 

383
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,230
means to reverse this stuff
if look if the reverse version is

384
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
if look if the reverse version is
 

385
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,589
if look if the reverse version is
exactly the same

386
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
exactly the same
 

387
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,270
exactly the same
then we answer what we want to add it

388
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
then we answer what we want to add it
 

389
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,790
then we answer what we want to add it
another one increment answer yeah yeah

390
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
another one increment answer yeah yeah
 

391
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,389
another one increment answer yeah yeah
add equal

392
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
add equal
 

393
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,430
add equal
one we're done and then return answer

394
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
one we're done and then return answer
 

395
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,469
one we're done and then return answer
we're done okay so look what's the time

396
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
we're done okay so look what's the time
 

397
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,430
we're done okay so look what's the time
complexity

398
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
complexity
 

399
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,350
complexity
oh and square this is what

400
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
oh and square this is what
 

401
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,470
oh and square this is what
o and q look this is o right

402
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
o and q look this is o right
 

403
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,949
o and q look this is o right
look o n o n square and

404
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
look o n o n square and
 

405
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,230
look o n o n square and
and this another end here look this is a

406
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
and this another end here look this is a
 

407
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,030
and this another end here look this is a
hidden end

408
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
hidden end
 

409
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,949
hidden end
so it's o and cubic okay remember this

410
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
so it's o and cubic okay remember this
 

411
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,949
so it's o and cubic okay remember this
can we do better i always want to

412
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
can we do better i always want to
 

413
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,710
can we do better i always want to
yeah of course we can i'll give you a

414
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
yeah of course we can i'll give you a
 

415
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,310
yeah of course we can i'll give you a
hint dynamic

416
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
hint dynamic
 

417
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,509
hint dynamic
programming foundation

418
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
programming foundation
 

419
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,949
programming foundation
how can we use the diagram yeah

420
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
how can we use the diagram yeah
 

421
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,949
how can we use the diagram yeah
memorization so how many kinds of

422
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
memorization so how many kinds of
 

423
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,150
memorization so how many kinds of
dynamic programming

424
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
dynamic programming
 

425
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,750
dynamic programming
we have memorization

426
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
we have memorization
 

427
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,750
we have memorization
so how many kinds of dynamic programming

428
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
so how many kinds of dynamic programming
 

429
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,910
so how many kinds of dynamic programming
do we have

430
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
do we have
 

431
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,509
do we have
motivation

432
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519

 

433
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:43,509

top down yeah

434
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519

 

435
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,750

the program of previous approach is that

436
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
the program of previous approach is that
 

437
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,949
the program of previous approach is that
we have to check

438
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
we have to check
 

439
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,070
we have to check
each possible substring for to to check

440
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
each possible substring for to to check
 

441
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,430
each possible substring for to to check
each substring if it's a

442
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
each substring if it's a
 

443
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,509
each substring if it's a
pending term right but sometimes we

444
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
pending term right but sometimes we
 

445
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,790
pending term right but sometimes we
don't need to check am right do you

446
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
don't need to check am right do you
 

447
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,310
don't need to check am right do you
understand

448
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
understand
 

449
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,509
understand
all right listen look if

450
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
all right listen look if
 

451
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,590
all right listen look if
a if a b we know ap

452
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
a if a b we know ap
 

453
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,710
a if a b we know ap
it's not a prediction right right

454
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
it's not a prediction right right
 

455
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,110
it's not a prediction right right
yeah it's not paranoid so if i put

456
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
yeah it's not paranoid so if i put
 

457
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,990
yeah it's not paranoid so if i put
another c

458
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
another c
 

459
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,190
another c
is it a challenger no if i put x

460
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
is it a challenger no if i put x
 

461
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,430
is it a challenger no if i put x
you see the paragraph no of course

462
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
you see the paragraph no of course
 

463
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,350
you see the paragraph no of course
because this is not parallel so and you

464
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
because this is not parallel so and you
 

465
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,870
because this is not parallel so and you
put any letters

466
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
put any letters
 

467
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,710
put any letters
around it it doesn't make it pendulum

468
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
around it it doesn't make it pendulum
 

469
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,870
around it it doesn't make it pendulum
right but this is the value

470
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
right but this is the value
 

471
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,790
right but this is the value
i know i know so so look if i use a

472
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
i know i know so so look if i use a
 

473
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,550
i know i know so so look if i use a
i use a function f i j okay look

474
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
i use a function f i j okay look
 

475
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,470
i use a function f i j okay look
f i j means means what

476
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
f i j means means what
 

477
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,750
f i j means means what
means that the s from i

478
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
means that the s from i
 

479
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,870
means that the s from i
to j plus one j yeah

480
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
to j plus one j yeah
 

481
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,630
to j plus one j yeah
if to mean if this is a parallel right

482
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
if to mean if this is a parallel right
 

483
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,030
if to mean if this is a parallel right
all right eric so what does it mean e

484
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
all right eric so what does it mean e
 

485
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,470
all right eric so what does it mean e
equals what

486
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
equals what
 

487
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,509
equals what
s i equals sj

488
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
s i equals sj
 

489
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,710
s i equals sj
n right look if if

490
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
n right look if if
 

491
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,030
n right look if if
this is a parent drug i don't care how

492
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
this is a parent drug i don't care how
 

493
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,550
this is a parent drug i don't care how
many in there right

494
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
many in there right

this is at
index j if this needs to tangent it

500
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
index j if this needs to tangent it
 

501
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,030
index j if this needs to tangent it
means that

502
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
means that
 

503
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,269
means that
these two letters must be the same right

504
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
these two letters must be the same right
 

505
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,550
these two letters must be the same right
yeah and

506
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
yeah and
 

507
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,949
yeah and
these inside should be apparent all

508
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
these inside should be apparent all
 

509
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,150
these inside should be apparent all
right

510
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
right
 

511
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,069
right
does it make sense so this is broken

512
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
does it make sense so this is broken
 

513
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,269
does it make sense so this is broken

the substring between index i to index j
 

523
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,509
the substring between index i to index j
is apparent or not okay so it means what

524
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
is apparent or not okay so it means what
 

525
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,630
is apparent or not okay so it means what
it needs to the almost

526
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
it needs to the almost
 

527
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,870
it needs to the almost
characters needs to match it needs to be

528
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
characters needs to match it needs to be
 

529
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,910
characters needs to match it needs to be
the same so a e

530
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
the same so a e
 

531
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,269
the same so a e
must be equal to b right am i

532
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
must be equal to b right am i
 

533

559
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,949

so we can save this value right we can

560
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
so we can save this value right we can
 

561
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:37,350
so we can save this value right we can
save

562
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
save
 

563
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,550
save
each s i j yeah all right yeah so we

564
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
each s i j yeah all right yeah so we
 

565
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,030
each s i j yeah all right yeah so we
need

566
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
need
 

567
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,949
need
o n square to to calculate this is a

568
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
o n square to to calculate this is a
 

569
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,069
o n square to to calculate this is a
value and then we just need a one

570
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
value and then we just need a one
 

571
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,949
value and then we just need a one
constant to get it so over all time

572
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
constant to get it so over all time
 

573
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,790
constant to get it so over all time
complexity will be o n square

574
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
complexity will be o n square
 

575
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,030
complexity will be o n square
will reduce the complexity to one

576
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
will reduce the complexity to one
 

577
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:11,590
will reduce the complexity to one
uh one scale right i show you

578
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600

 

579
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,110

okay so now i'm going to write it okay

580
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
okay so now i'm going to write it okay
 

581
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,389
okay so now i'm going to write it okay
if

582
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399

 

583
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,150

okay now i i thought if i bigger than j

584
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
okay now i i thought if i bigger than j
 

585
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,389
okay now i i thought if i bigger than j
i would return true for now i'll tell

586
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
i would return true for now i'll tell
 

587
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,150
i would return true for now i'll tell
you why okay

588
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
you why okay
 

589
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,470
you why okay
and then else i return

590
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480

 

591
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,350

s i equals j

and f i plus one j
 

595
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,069
and f i plus one j
minus one right yes yeah okay

596
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:42,079
minus one right yes yeah okay
 

597
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,230
minus one right yes yeah okay
so look what's missing in here

598
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
so look what's missing in here
 

599
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,470
so look what's missing in here
cash because i need to cash it right so

600
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
cash because i need to cash it right so
 

601
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,269
cash because i need to cash it right so
after cash

602
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
after cash
 

603
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,310
after cash
then every

604
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
then every
 

605
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,230
then every
pair of i j will be calculated only once

606
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
pair of i j will be calculated only once
 

607
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,949
pair of i j will be calculated only once
right so how many possibilities of i j

608
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
right so how many possibilities of i j
 

609
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,870
right so how many possibilities of i j
pairs

610
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
pairs
 

611
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,030
pairs
how many possibilities are i j pairs

612
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040

 

613
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,189

if if i uh if i is bigger than zero

614
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
if if i uh if i is bigger than zero
 

615
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,069
if if i uh if i is bigger than zero
smaller than let's say smaller than n j

616
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
smaller than let's say smaller than n j
 

617
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,590
smaller than let's say smaller than n j
is bigger than zero

618
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
is bigger than zero
 

619
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,990
is bigger than zero
and smaller than n how many is a

620
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
and smaller than n how many is a
 

621
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,389
and smaller than n how many is a
possibility

622
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
possibility
 

623
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,509
possibility
and n minus one

624
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
and n minus one
 

625
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,350
and n minus one
and one minus two sorry

626
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
and one minus two sorry
 

627
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,790
and one minus two sorry
three what you talking about look i

628
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
three what you talking about look i
 

629
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,310
three what you talking about look i
i i could be from zero to n

630
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
i i could be from zero to n
 

631
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,030
i i could be from zero to n
and j will be from zero to n so how many

632
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
and j will be from zero to n so how many
 

633
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,150
and j will be from zero to n so how many
possibilities of i

634
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
possibilities of i
 

635
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,350
possibilities of i
is a okay n yeah

636
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
is a okay n yeah
 

637
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,829
is a okay n yeah
n times n this is the complexity of

638
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
n times n this is the complexity of
 

639
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,629
n times n this is the complexity of
these

640
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
these
 

641
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,230
these
all right got it okay now

642
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,240
all right got it okay now
 

643
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,949
all right got it okay now
now look we just need to add a array

644
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
now look we just need to add a array
 

645
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,350
now look we just need to add a array
look

646
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
look
 

647
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,189
look
answer equals zero and we can just do

648
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
answer equals zero and we can just do
 

649
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,110
answer equals zero and we can just do
this for i in

650
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
this for i in
 

651
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,310
this for i in
range n right n is the length of s yeah

652
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
range n right n is the length of s yeah
 

653
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,590
range n right n is the length of s yeah
and f for j in range

654
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
and f for j in range
 

655
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,509
and f for j in range
range i n right

656
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
range i n right
 

657
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,470
range i n right
if can you write any speed for me and i

658
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
if can you write any speed for me and i
 

659
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,509
if can you write any speed for me and i
can say written answer

660
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
can say written answer
 

661
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,750
can say written answer
so can you write can you write like this

662
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
so can you write can you write like this
 

663
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,590
so can you write can you write like this
is for me

664
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
is for me
 

665
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,829
is for me
if one it's what i have function for you

666
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
if one it's what i have function for you
 

667
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,470
if one it's what i have function for you
to call

668
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
to call
 

669
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,829
to call
if what

670
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839

 

671
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:37,990

before

672
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000

 

673
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:48,550

j

674
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560

 

675
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,829

so this is o n look o n square

676
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
so this is o n look o n square
 

677
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,990
so this is o n look o n square
this is another one square so all your

678
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
this is another one square so all your
 

679
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,430
this is another one square so all your
articular is

680
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
articular is
 

681
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,269
articular is
how many complexes

682
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279

 

683
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,670

is o and o n squared and o square is

684
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
is o and o n squared and o square is
 

685
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,389
is o and o n squared and o square is
what a

686
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
what a
 

687
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,430
what a
keyboard no no no a

688
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
keyboard no no no a
 

689
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,150
keyboard no no no a
o n squared times n is our cubic o n

690
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
o n squared times n is our cubic o n
 

691
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,629
o n squared times n is our cubic o n
squared

692
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
squared
 

693
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,870
squared
plus o n squared n squared plus n square

694
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
plus o n squared n squared plus n square
 

695
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,470
plus o n squared n squared plus n square
equals 1

696
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
equals 1
 

697
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,749
equals 1
2 n square yeah 2 n squared right

698
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
2 n square yeah 2 n squared right
 

699
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,389
2 n square yeah 2 n squared right
yeah but we drop the constant okay so if

700
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
yeah but we drop the constant okay so if
 

701
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,590
yeah but we drop the constant okay so if
still is o n

702
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
still is o n
 

703
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,350
still is o n
square all right yes

704
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
square all right yes
 

705
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,150
square all right yes
because this is this is constant i'm

706
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
because this is this is constant i'm
 

707
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,030
because this is this is constant i'm
only

708
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
only
 

709
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,910
only
performing two times of o n square so

710
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
performing two times of o n square so
 

711
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,389
performing two times of o n square so
the complexity is still on square

712
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
the complexity is still on square
 

713
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,629
the complexity is still on square
okay but if this is if i

714
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
okay but if this is if i
 

715
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,749
okay but if this is if i
if i look eric if i move this function

716
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
if i look eric if i move this function
 

717
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,389
if i look eric if i move this function
if i move this inside this four like the

718
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
if i move this inside this four like the
 

719
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,230
if i move this inside this four like the
first one the blue force yeah

720
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
first one the blue force yeah
 

721
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,910
first one the blue force yeah
right then it's one square times

722
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
right then it's one square times
 

723
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,550
right then it's one square times
o n right so in this case it's o and

724
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
o n right so in this case it's o and
 

725
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,509
o n right so in this case it's o and
cubic do you

726
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
cubic do you
 

727
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,870
cubic do you
get it yes and

728
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:54,880
get it yes and
 

729
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,389
get it yes and
look uh look this is answer yeah we can

730
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
look uh look this is answer yeah we can
 

731
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,990
look uh look this is answer yeah we can
do this in one line

732
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
do this in one line
 

733
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,269
do this in one line
look this is a very very uh python

734
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
look this is a very very uh python
 

735
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,309
look this is a very very uh python
way to calculate look look eric remember

736
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
way to calculate look look eric remember
 

737
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,270
way to calculate look look eric remember
this a

738
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
this a
 

739
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,789
this a
look you're looking yeah yeah

740
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
look you're looking yeah yeah
 

741
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,789
look you're looking yeah yeah
okay so we can do this we can still keep

742
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
okay so we can do this we can still keep
 

743
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,029
okay so we can do this we can still keep
it and we can return

744
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
it and we can return
 

745
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,029
it and we can return
return blah f

746
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
return blah f
 

747
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,470
return blah f
i z for i

748
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
i z for i
 

749
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,710
i z for i
in we can do this using this this kind

750
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
in we can do this using this this kind
 

751
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,069
in we can do this using this this kind
of thing like range

752
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
of thing like range
 

753
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,270
of thing like range
and and then follow j

754
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
and and then follow j
 

755
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,390
and and then follow j
in range i

756
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
in range i
 

757
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,630
in range i
and right and then what and

758
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640
and right and then what and
 

759
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,630
and right and then what and
uh and this will create an array a list

760
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
uh and this will create an array a list
 

761
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,029
uh and this will create an array a list
and then i just need to count counter

762
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
and then i just need to count counter
 

763
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,909
and then i just need to count counter
one

764
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
one
 

765
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,590
one
count true right count the truth

766
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:47,600
count true right count the truth
 

767
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,270
count true right count the truth
and then you will tell me how many of

768
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
and then you will tell me how many of
 

769
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,350
and then you will tell me how many of
them is parent

770
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
them is parent
 

771
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,789
them is parent
because f i j because f i j

772
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
because f i j because f i j
 

773
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,909
because f i j because f i j
says is what is

774
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919
says is what is
 

775
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,710
says is what is
is means that the the substring between

776
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
is means that the the substring between
 

777
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,150
is means that the the substring between
i and j if it's apparent

778
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
i and j if it's apparent
 

779
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,270
i and j if it's apparent
look at why this i plus i

780
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
look at why this i plus i
 

781
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,310
look at why this i plus i
bigger than j is the true you know what

782
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
bigger than j is the true you know what
 

783
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,510
bigger than j is the true you know what
i tell you look all right bb is it a

784
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
i tell you look all right bb is it a
 

785
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,510
i tell you look all right bb is it a
paragraph yeah okay this is i

786
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
paragraph yeah okay this is i
 

787
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,710
paragraph yeah okay this is i
this is z z

788
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:18,720
this is z z
 

789
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,909
this is z z
p b f i and j next to each other right

790
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
p b f i and j next to each other right
 

791
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,190
p b f i and j next to each other right
yeah s i equals x j right

792
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
yeah s i equals x j right
 

793
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,470
yeah s i equals x j right
so n f i plus one j minus one so i will

794
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
so n f i plus one j minus one so i will
 

795
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,190
so n f i plus one j minus one so i will
be

796
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
be
 

797
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,470
be
i will be here j will be here right so i

798
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
i will be here j will be here right so i
 

799
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,950
i will be here j will be here right so i
is bigger than j right if relaxing the

800
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
is bigger than j right if relaxing the
 

801
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,630
is bigger than j right if relaxing the
case i return true

802
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:36,640
case i return true
 

803
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,350
case i return true
right so this will simplify the

804
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
right so this will simplify the
 

805
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,789
right so this will simplify the
implementation if

806
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:40,799
implementation if
 

807
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,230
implementation if
if you say this is written first

808
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,240
if you say this is written first
 

809
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,430
if you say this is written first
that's fine but you you have to make

810
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
that's fine but you you have to make
 

811
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,710
that's fine but you you have to make
this a special case

812
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
this a special case
 

813
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,870
this a special case
which is if i plus one equals j

814
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
which is if i plus one equals j
 

815
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,510
which is if i plus one equals j
and s i equals straight and return true

816
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
and s i equals straight and return true
 

817
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,470
and s i equals straight and return true
right

818
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
right
 

819
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,590
right
otherwise return s i equals s j and

820
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
otherwise return s i equals s j and
 

821
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,470
otherwise return s i equals s j and
f i plus one j into minus one correct

822
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
f i plus one j into minus one correct
 

823
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,350
f i plus one j into minus one correct
yes

824
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
yes
 

825
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,390
yes
so i if i return true then i don't mean

826
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400
so i if i return true then i don't mean
 

827
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,430
so i if i return true then i don't mean
that uh separate check yeah because i

828
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
that uh separate check yeah because i
 

829
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,150
that uh separate check yeah because i
can

830
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,160
can
 

831
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,870
can
in this case i can still handle this bb

832
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:12,880
in this case i can still handle this bb
 

833
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,750
in this case i can still handle this bb
okay

834
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
okay
 

835
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,669
okay
how about bab yeah

836
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679
how about bab yeah
 

837
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,830
how about bab yeah
i j alright look

838
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
i j alright look
 

839
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,190
i j alright look
s i equals sj right

840
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
s i equals sj right
 

841
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,990
s i equals sj right
f i plus one j minus one so i and j will

842
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
f i plus one j minus one so i and j will
 

843
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,350
f i plus one j minus one so i and j will
continue to a

844
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
continue to a
 

845
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,390
continue to a
still equal right still equal

846
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
still equal right still equal
 

847
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,990
still equal right still equal
yeah okay so this is the beauty of

848
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
yeah okay so this is the beauty of
 

849
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,669
yeah okay so this is the beauty of
styling programming right

850
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679
styling programming right
 

851
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,350
styling programming right
because we know a is the planning drum

852
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
because we know a is the planning drum
 

853
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,750
because we know a is the planning drum
we put two similar things on both sides

854
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
we put two similar things on both sides
 

855
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,789
we put two similar things on both sides
still parent drum

856
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
still parent drum
 

857
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,789
still parent drum
we put another thing on the both sides

858
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:44,799
we put another thing on the both sides
 

859
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,549
we put another thing on the both sides
still apparently yeah correct

860
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
still apparently yeah correct
 

861
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,789
still apparently yeah correct
yeah yeah we don't need to check the in

862
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
yeah yeah we don't need to check the in
 

863
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,750
yeah yeah we don't need to check the in
inside

864
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760
inside
 

865
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,909
inside
match because we already know this is

866
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:51,919
match because we already know this is
 

867
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,669
match because we already know this is
the palindrome we just keep adding we

868
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
the palindrome we just keep adding we
 

869
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:53,990
the palindrome we just keep adding we
are

870
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
are
 

871
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,750
are
using the previous result okay top down

872
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
using the previous result okay top down
 

873
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,549
using the previous result okay top down
how about butter up what's butter up

874
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
how about butter up what's butter up
 

875
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,750
how about butter up what's butter up
what's top down

876
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760

 

877
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,510

all right yeah up

878
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520

 

879
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,390

yeah so we we defined look we didn't eat

880
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
yeah so we we defined look we didn't eat
 

881
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,110
yeah so we we defined look we didn't eat
cash

882
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
cash
 

883
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,029
cash
yeah i don't use the cash because using

884
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
yeah i don't use the cash because using
 

885
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,789
yeah i don't use the cash because using
cash is for recursion yeah

886
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
cash is for recursion yeah
 

887
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,470
cash is for recursion yeah
yeah i have a question i asked for this

888
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
yeah i have a question i asked for this
 

889
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,470
yeah i have a question i asked for this
value i and j and then

890
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
value i and j and then
 

891
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,669
value i and j and then
the computer say okay i have put i have

892
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
the computer say okay i have put i have
 

893
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,470
the computer say okay i have put i have
a cache

894
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:24,480
a cache
 

895
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,789
a cache
let's check if i j has been calculated

896
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799
let's check if i j has been calculated
 

897
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,669
let's check if i j has been calculated
before

898
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
before
 

899
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,149
before
right it has been calculated it has been

900
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:30,159
right it has been calculated it has been
 

901
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,909
right it has been calculated it has been
we have called it to calculate it then

902
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
we have called it to calculate it then
 

903
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,029
we have called it to calculate it then
that's fine

904
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
that's fine
 

905
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,270
that's fine
we just take the value without

906
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
we just take the value without
 

907
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,510
we just take the value without
calculating do you get it

908
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:37,520
calculating do you get it
 

909
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,270
calculating do you get it
yeah let's see it's like

910
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
yeah let's see it's like
 

911
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,270
yeah let's see it's like
you're doing homework right you're doing

912
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
you're doing homework right you're doing
 

913
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,669
you're doing homework right you're doing
homework like ryan

914
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
homework like ryan
 

915
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,470
homework like ryan
likes to look for the answers yeah let's

916
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
likes to look for the answers yeah let's
 

917
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,149
likes to look for the answers yeah let's
answer the [ __ ] yeah

918
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
answer the [ __ ] yeah
 

919
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,070
answer the [ __ ] yeah
yeah without actually doing the homework

920
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080
yeah without actually doing the homework
 

921
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,070
yeah without actually doing the homework
yeah sometimes you do that right

922
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,080
yeah sometimes you do that right
 

923
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,789
yeah sometimes you do that right
yeah i know you do that yeah that answer

924
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
yeah i know you do that yeah that answer
 

925
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,549
yeah i know you do that yeah that answer
[ __ ] is the cash

926
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:58,559
[ __ ] is the cash
 

927
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,070
[ __ ] is the cash
so it's i pretend i'm ryan okay

928
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
so it's i pretend i'm ryan okay
 

929
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,870
so it's i pretend i'm ryan okay
write the first question okay okay and

930
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
write the first question okay okay and
 

931
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,390
write the first question okay okay and
then i check list

932
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
then i check list
 

933
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,470
then i check list
i check this in the answer sheet okay i

934
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,480
i check this in the answer sheet okay i
 

935
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,990
i check this in the answer sheet okay i
found the answer and then i just

936
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,000
found the answer and then i just
 

937
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,669
found the answer and then i just
directly copy right

938
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
directly copy right
 

939
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,710
directly copy right
yeah got it does it make sense

940
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
yeah got it does it make sense
 

941
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,070
yeah got it does it make sense
okay

942
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080

 

943
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,390

so we need to create a dp array right

944
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
so we need to create a dp array right
 

945
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,909
so we need to create a dp array right
for the button out we need to array for

946
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
for the button out we need to array for
 

947
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:24,870
for the button out we need to array for
pp alright

948
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:24,880
pp alright
 

949
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,909
pp alright
dp equals

950
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:27,919
dp equals
 

951
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,270
dp equals
equals let's see

952
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,280
equals let's see
 

953
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,390
equals let's see
two times n

954
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,400
two times n
 

955
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,950
two times n
for i in range n okay so let's create a

956
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
for i in range n okay so let's create a
 

957
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,070
for i in range n okay so let's create a
dp array

958
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
dp array
 

959
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,029
dp array
which contains two dimensional yeah all

960
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
which contains two dimensional yeah all
 

961
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,310
which contains two dimensional yeah all
right yeah

962
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
right yeah
 

963
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,669
right yeah
another story is for i in

964
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
another story is for i in
 

965
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,470
another story is for i in
range let's start from the n minus one

966
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
range let's start from the n minus one
 

967
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,909
range let's start from the n minus one
from the right hand side

968
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
from the right hand side
 

969
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,070
from the right hand side
look i think i will start from here

970
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
look i think i will start from here
 

971
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,990
look i think i will start from here
to the left yeah to the left and right

972
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,000
to the left yeah to the left and right
 

973
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,430
to the left yeah to the left and right
let's look star

974
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440
let's look star
 

975
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,270
let's look star
alright look at the range function can

976
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,280
alright look at the range function can
 

977
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,669
alright look at the range function can
take three parameters the star

978
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
take three parameters the star
 

979
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,350
take three parameters the star
stop step step minus one means

980
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
stop step step minus one means
 

981
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,430
stop step step minus one means
you will be decrementing start from n

982
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
you will be decrementing start from n
 

983
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,430
you will be decrementing start from n
minus one stop

984
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
minus one stop
 

985
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,549
minus one stop
minus one but not up to minus one so the

986
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
minus one but not up to minus one so the
 

987
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,190
minus one but not up to minus one so the
last value will be zero right

988
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
last value will be zero right
 

989
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,830
last value will be zero right
and then for j in

990
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
and then for j in
 

991
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,270
and then for j in
range i yeah i start from i

992
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
range i yeah i start from i
 

993
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,669
range i yeah i start from i
i learn to n then i can say dp

994
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
i learn to n then i can say dp
 

995
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,789
i learn to n then i can say dp
i j equals

996
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
i j equals
 

997
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,950
i j equals
s i equals sj

998
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:40,960
s i equals sj
 

999
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,350
s i equals sj
and n1 everything right here

1000
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
and n1 everything right here
 

1001
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,549
and n1 everything right here
dpij this is array okay

1002
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
dpij this is array okay
 

1003
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,149
dpij this is array okay
s i equals sj and and what

1004
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
s i equals sj and and what
 

1005
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,110
s i equals sj and and what
and what dpy and tp1 can you write it

1006
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,120
and what dpy and tp1 can you write it
 

1007
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,990
and what dpy and tp1 can you write it
dpf

1008
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,000

 

1009
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,630

dp i j i d p i j equals s i equals

1010
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
dp i j i d p i j equals s i equals
 

1011
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,470
dp i j i d p i j equals s i equals
straight and

1012
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
straight and
 

1013
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,070
straight and
minus one yeah that's it so now we

1014
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
minus one yeah that's it so now we
 

1015
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,669
minus one yeah that's it so now we
put we compete no yeah no yeah

1016
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
put we compete no yeah no yeah
 

1017
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,470
put we compete no yeah no yeah
com completing this uh feeling is the dp

1018
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
com completing this uh feeling is the dp
 

1019
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,990
com completing this uh feeling is the dp
array and now we can

1020
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
array and now we can
 

1021
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,230
array and now we can
we can do the same right for i equals

1022
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
we can do the same right for i equals
 

1023
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,310
we can do the same right for i equals
and for j because then if

1024
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
and for j because then if
 

1025
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,430
and for j because then if
if dpi is a now we answer plus one yeah

1026
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
if dpi is a now we answer plus one yeah
 

1027
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,350
if dpi is a now we answer plus one yeah
this this bit is the same the time

1028
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
this this bit is the same the time
 

1029
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,270
this this bit is the same the time
complexity is

1030
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,280
complexity is
 

1031
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,350
complexity is
oh and o and one

1032
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
oh and o and one
 

1033
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,029
oh and o and one
no y o n

1034
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:37,039

 

1035
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,909

because this big is all n squared and

1036
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
because this big is all n squared and
 

1037
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,549
because this big is all n squared and
this b

1038
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:40,559
this b
 

1039
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,870
this b
is still one square all squared plus one

1040
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
is still one square all squared plus one
 

1041
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,390
is still one square all squared plus one
square

1042
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
square
 

1043
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,029
square
squared but we drop the constant yeah so

1044
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
squared but we drop the constant yeah so
 

1045
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,390
squared but we drop the constant yeah so
you become o n squared

1046
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
you become o n squared
 

1047
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,669
you become o n squared
what's the space complexity

1048
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679

 

1049
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,789

one we are using the dp array what

1050
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
one we are using the dp array what
 

1051
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,830
one we are using the dp array what
n what is that a one it's a two

1052
00:23:59,830 --> 00:23:59,840
n what is that a one it's a two
 

1053
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,430
n what is that a one it's a two
dimensional array so one

1054
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
dimensional array so one
 

1055
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,549
dimensional array so one
square o n square come on see

1056
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
square o n square come on see
 

1057
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,269
square o n square come on see
because we need our own square space to

1058
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:07,279
because we need our own square space to
 

1059
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:07,750
because we need our own square space to
store

1060
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
store
 

1061
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,830
store
all the possibilities of the substrings

1062
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:09,840
all the possibilities of the substrings
 

1063
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,510
all the possibilities of the substrings
right am right

1064
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
right am right
 

1065
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,950
right am right
yes okay so

1066
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:14,960
yes okay so
 

1067
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,470
yes okay so
say bye so which one you think is better

1068
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
say bye so which one you think is better
 

1069
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,909
say bye so which one you think is better
i don't know i think which one

1070
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
i don't know i think which one
 

1071
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,669
i don't know i think which one
boy boy you don't know okay so which one

1072
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:25,679
boy boy you don't know okay so which one
 

1073
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:34,789
boy boy you don't know okay so which one
you like

1074
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:34,799

 

1075
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:43,840

okay okay let's say bye see you tomorrow
