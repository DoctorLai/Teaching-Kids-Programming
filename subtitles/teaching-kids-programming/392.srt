1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
you go

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,839
how are we all right

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,839
yeah we talk about the games in the last

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,519
few days we talked about the tic-tac-toe

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,840
game we talked about the new max tree

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,639
yeah we met it's a country yeah so

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,040
what's

8
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,440
special about this country is what do

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,590
you still record any of those the game

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,809
tree the mean max what's mean max

11
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,809
[Music]

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,320
that's that's a very good answer yeah so

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,720
one tries to minimize it the other one

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,680
tries to maximize it okay so let's i'll

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,040
give a few numbers and then

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,640
let's discuss about this okay three five

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,640
six nine

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,040
okay so here

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,280
if we want to maximize at this level and

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,079
we want to minimize here

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,680
okay so i just give a portion of the

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,920
tree so

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,719
what value should i put here

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,079
okay you should put three

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,879
the maximum

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,160
five okay okay i put a knife here

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,559
yeah

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
okay so now okay so this is the

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,479
thing here come on listen come on come

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,439
on

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,760
so look if if the country is evaluated

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,960
from left to the right yeah from left to

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,119
right

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,200
okay look at this is the magic here left

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,240
to the right

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,479
okay this is five i know yeah but this

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,439
level we're trying to minimize yeah

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,200
all right yeah sure so now i have a

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,479
value five

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,880
so if this value is bigger than five

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,479
then this value will be less than five

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,280
that will be fine right

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,280
yeah make sense

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,439
so if this value

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,520
is smaller than five

46
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,920
if it's smaller than five

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,240
then the value will be smaller than five

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,079
all right the value yes did i say this

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,439
is x

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,399
okay

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,799
yeah

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,920
okay so now x

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,119
x

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,360
we know we already have a six here

55
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,560
yeah we already have a six here so we

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,599
want to get x maximum it's the

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,280
it's at least six i'm right so x is only

58
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,280
six

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,599
i'm right

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,920
make sense look

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,000
i i have i have found we have found the

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,599
value six here and at this level i'm

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,640
trying to maximize it so x is bigger or

64
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,879
equal than 6. make sense

65
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,879
yeah

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,280
x is bigger than equal than 6. and this

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,680
level we are trying to minimize it we

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,239
have 5 and we know x is bigger than six

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,239
what does this mean

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,000
so

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,400
does it really matter

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,840
the values here

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
does it really matter the values here

74
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,200
let's x is bigger than six

75
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,360
i know x is bigger than six right

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,200
so i don't need to visit this because i

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,920
know x is bigger than six

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,080
if x is bigger than 6 it can't be better

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,040
than 5 because we are trying to minimize

80
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,680
here

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,800
okay because look at this level

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,400
here

83
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,120
this value here

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,200
is the minimum of these two values

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,200
i

86
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,440
and now look it's the minimum of these

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,400
two values so it's minimum of five and x

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,000
but x is bigger than six

89
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,560
x is bigger than six

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,560
what does it mean

91
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,200
i have five now i have x x is bigger

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,200
than six right yeah

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,519
so i don't i don't have two i have to

94
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,860
visit this tree here

95
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,760
why is that it's because you know

96
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,640
[Music]

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,439
it's bigger than 6.

98
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,080
yeah

99
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,400
this this value x is bigger than 6. no

100
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,799
matter what value put it here right

101
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,560
yeah it put a hundred

102
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,480
then it's a bigger than hundred if at

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,640
least put the minus five

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,400
minus a hundred

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,280
this value is six

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,879
yeah

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,560
so if it

108
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,959
it's bigger than six so if it's a six

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,199
and i want to get a minimum of these two

110
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
i have five here

111
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,120
right so i don't care what what have

112
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,479
what value in these three these could be

113
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,040
a huge

114
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,720
this would be that this would be the tip

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,960
of iceberg

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,280
type of ice cream cookies

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,759
yeah i know another tip of iceberg what

118
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,759
does it mean

119
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,240
what is this meaning in english

120
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,529
[Music]

121
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
we don't need to

122
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,120
yeah so we don't the point is what we

123
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,000
don't have to visit these people

124
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,919
and you will save us time right

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,840
that we this is

126
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,199
one situation how about the other one

127
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,080
how about

128
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,919
let me just write another one and then

129
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,080
and you can tell me it's quite similar

130
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,080
okay

131
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,360
okay so let's see

132
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,800
we have values here alright right the

133
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,720
trees and trees the country evaluated

134
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,720
from left to the right okay and it

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,880
doesn't have to be binary tree

136
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,919
instead it could be many many depending

137
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,400
on

138
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,639
this is one one node is one game state

139
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,120
so one state you have a different

140
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,880
different moves right yeah

141
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,479
yeah but for example for the tic-tac-toe

142
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,720
you have uh

143
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
the branch vector could be nine why is

144
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,800
that

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,800
at most for the tic-tac-toe game because

146
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,120
there's nine squares nine squares yes

147
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
starting from the loot you have night

148
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,360
choice

149
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,360
you have night choice right yeah

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,720
okay so now we have

151
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,400
five six four uh five six

152
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,600
four five and then we are trying to

153
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,120
do the minimize here

154
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,440
yeah we are trying to do the minimize

155
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,600
and try to do the maximizing okay so

156
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,720
what's the mean here what's this really

157
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
five

158
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,360
okay

159
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,639
four

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,720
okay okay again again

161
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,080
again okay i'm trying to maximize here

162
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,120
so this is x

163
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,120
this is question mark

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,039
we're trying to minimize here so i know

165
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,720
there's a four so what's this value

166
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,120
four

167
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
actually

168
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,400
four less yeah four less

169
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,479
okay and i'm trying to maximize here if

170
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,840
it's four or less in the middle the most

171
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,080
is four right

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,599
yeah if it's most is four

173
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,520
we have five here

174
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,440
doesn't matter

175
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,680
it doesn't matter

176
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,319
so that's five yeah so what does it mean

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,599
so now i'm evaluating 3 from left to

178
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,319
right once i found this is 4

179
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,290
and i know this value is 5 here

180
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,560
right

181
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,599
[Music]

182
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,919
and

183
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,919
i don't need to evaluate this subtree

184
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,840
here do you understand that

185
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,080
yeah yeah

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,800
so this bit

187
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,560
i can just cut it

188
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,360
yeah do you mean do you know do you

189
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,360
understand let's cut it

190
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,520
so so if i cut it it means that we don't

191
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,360
need to travel yeah we don't need to

192
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,560
travel to it okay

193
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,800
right yeah

194
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
yeah

195
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,599
this this situation and the one i showed

196
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,800
you before yeah it's similar but

197
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,199
different right so this one look is

198
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,520
this one is x smaller than four that one

199
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,000
is actually bigger than what we still

200
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,039
remember x is bigger than nine right

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,840
yeah the previous one example yeah

202
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,800
uh quicker than 6 okay

203
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,160
yeah

204
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,280
okay so we we call this aggregate

205
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,319
we call it alpha beta puni

206
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,319
okay alpha beta

207
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,479
yeah

208
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,360
so it's an improved version of the min

209
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,839
max so it will save us time

210
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,959
so it's alpha

211
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,640
alpha

212
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,640
alpha

213
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,640
beta

214
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,760
the greek letters yeah other better

215
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,720
pruning so it's an improved version of

216
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,600
midnight that mean max we just exhausted

217
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,800
all the branches yeah one thing

218
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,920
exhausting yeah we the the first player

219
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,040
maximize the other one minimize and the

220
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,200
next one maximize minimize it takes time

221
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,600
right and now the other part happening

222
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,839
is just remember the gantry

223
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,959
we what we did is

224
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,440
what we stopped searching a branch

225
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,600
whenever we find it it's not

226
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,480
it's it's useless

227
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,440
to

228
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,440
traversa let's not try subtree why is

229
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,320
that because no matter

230
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,920
what's wrong yeah on that branch

231
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,320
you will never be better than the

232
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,320
current

233
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,920
okay so

234
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,080
we we can we can just add it in the min

235
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,200
max angle okay so let's write this mean

236
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,440
max first

237
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,000
you still remember me max yeah yesterday

238
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,279
that's yesterday okay so i skip the

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,720
sales so we have a state

240
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,360
we have a state

241
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,160
we have a steps default and we have uh

242
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,240
uh well we have a turn yeah so

243
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,000
instead of two let's make it uh so we

244
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,279
maximize it

245
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
we maximize it okay maximize

246
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,240
maximize it okay

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
yeah

248
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,800
so let me just slide it

249
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,320
so if okay if it's nd stay okay if the

250
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,320
state is is a end state if they

251
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,399
is n stay yeah it's terminal is the

252
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,079
terminal it's a leaf node right it's

253
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,240
lift now

254
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,480
i'm just writing the cup here it stays

255
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,880
the digital or if the state is the end

256
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,880
state then we can retain a score of it

257
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,480
yeah we can return the score which is

258
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,120
the utility function

259
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,920
utility function of state okay

260
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,040
now look if we are maximizing it if we

261
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,160
are maximizing it

262
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
then

263
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,839
we need to go through the action yeah we

264
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,440
have a current score okay so we have a

265
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,000
star

266
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,560
score equal maximizing it's a letter

267
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,720
beginning it will be the negative

268
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,320
infinity and we go through the actions

269
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,839
called action

270
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,800
actions

271
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,440
in fact actions okay we have seven

272
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,399
actions given the state and then this

273
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,600
action function will tell me what

274
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,440
possible moves in that okay so then

275
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
i will have a state yesterday the new

276
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,200
state

277
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,120
this is for yesterday new state equals

278
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,720
the successor

279
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,519
of the state

280
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,680
and then action

281
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,000
okay stay in action

282
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,680
and we are maximizing since we are

283
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,480
maximizing so uh

284
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,839
so

285
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,200
the current score the current

286
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,200
score equal as min max

287
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,760
min max new state

288
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,680
we are going we are going down we make

289
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,240
one move one is already plus one to do

290
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,560
this next level and then we are

291
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,600
maximizing in this one so the next one

292
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,120
will be

293
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,079
what

294
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,839
minimizing minimizing so would be if it

295
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,680
is maximizing okay then we say

296
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,279
minimizing its fault okay we can just

297
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,680
say four

298
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,680
okay and then now if

299
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,240
new

300
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,920
if current score

301
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,680
current score

302
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,639
is bigger than

303
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,720
score

304
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,760
this is the best doll so far and then

305
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,040
score

306
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,040
equals current score

307
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,720
and then return return here return score

308
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,720
okay

309
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,200
as is the minimizing okay this is quite

310
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,079
similar except that we change the sign

311
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,959
right we we are minimizing it so

312
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,880
we we we should i change this to two and

313
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,360
then current square should be

314
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,560
score right so now

315
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,720
so we we can make changes in here to

316
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,519
make it alpha beta okay so first thing

317
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,680
is to to we we need to pass to that

318
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,880
value which is alpha and beta okay so

319
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,920
alpha

320
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,760
alpha and beta okay

321
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,160
and at the beginning we're passing this

322
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,880
alpha beta will be like

323
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,120
this with this is window right it's it's

324
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,160
alpha basically it defines the left

325
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,839
boundary

326
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,399
beta is the right boundary yeah

327
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,959
so it's like a window so here here is

328
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,760
alpha alpha this is better at the

329
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,560
beginning we put give a parameter minus

330
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,680
negative and then

331
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,519
a positive negative opposite infinity

332
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,839
yeah at the beginning we give a value

333
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,120
meaning that the store will fall in in

334
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,920
this range

335
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,240
right

336
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,440
yeah so if we keep searching that then

337
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,720
we can

338
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,800
we can push

339
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,440
we can push these boundaries towards

340
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,480
each other we can keep updating it right

341
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,519
so if how do we keep updating it so we

342
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,079
we can do what we can um

343
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,959
first of all we can have this uh

344
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,680
so here here will be our

345
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,320
alpha will be maximum half of the value

346
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,079
so if i put it here okay alpha then i

347
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,639
can change alpha equal i will keep

348
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,000
updating because this is trying to

349
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,639
push you know

350
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,600
to only maximize it so alpha equals max

351
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,440
alpha

352
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,000
and then value value will be current

353
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,760
state current score

354
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
okay

355
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,360
alpha i got this

356
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,639
the thing is that if we keep updating

357
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,560
the other and then if the next one is is

358
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:33,760
smaller than the alpha what does it mean

359
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:36,800
so if i can say if here if uh if i can

360
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,839
if i if current score is smaller than

361
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,160
alpha then i i i can just quit that's

362
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,320
what because we are trying to maximize

363
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,480
here right we are trying to maximize it

364
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,240
so first of all let me just change it to

365
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,560
alpha beta

366
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,560
alphabet okay so here will be alphabet

367
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,760
so i'm trying to maximize so look we are

368
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,519
trying to maximize here okay

369
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,040
the maximum we're trying to maximize it

370
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,279
so look if

371
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:11,120
if the value yeah if the current score

372
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,000
is bigger than beta

373
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,519
then i can just break okay

374
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,519
okay i can just spray okay

375
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,680
and then return the score here return

376
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,680
the score this is the maximizing it

377
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,959
so so look we are trying to maximize it

378
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,440
and then if the current score is bigger

379
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,240
than the score we update a score right

380
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,959
but also we push the boundary the left

381
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,360
boundary of our boundary to the right

382
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,560
and so we are pushing the boundary but

383
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,519
in some point in some case the value

384
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,560
if the value is bigger it's bigger than

385
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,600
here

386
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,240
right if the value is here

387
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,680
outside the boundary so i then i can

388
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,800
just

389
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,320
break

390
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,279
break it right

391
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,160
this is the this is we call it the beta

392
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,800
pruning because it falls be on the right

393
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,639
hand right boundary of beta so we we

394
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,519
just stop it because there is no point

395
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,360
to keep searching in the vc all right

396
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,440
yeah

397
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,079
okay so the other the other case is

398
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,959
minimizing it right so this will be the

399
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,680
same except

400
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,160
if this is minimizing it let's say i if

401
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,880
i say if this is minimizing it

402
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,160
minimizing it okay minimizing it

403
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,440
score will be

404
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,079
the positive positive infinity

405
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,560
and then i will change this to two right

406
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,600
because the next one will be maximizing

407
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,759
it right

408
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,759
right and in current score is smaller

409
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,240
than the score i updated the

410
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,360
current score and then you look

411
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,600
here

412
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,959
we'll be minimizing it but instead of

413
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,800
alpha we need to

414
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,959
the mean equals

415
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,839
better equals mean better current score

416
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,120
right

417
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,240
and if

418
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,120
if a current score

419
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,720
uh if the current score is smaller than

420
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,679
alpha

421
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,199
smaller or smaller than alpha okay

422
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,919
actually boundary doesn't matter if you

423
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,959
put the equal let's be o should be okay

424
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,400
as well if alpha is square

425
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,360
smaller than other then we break it

426
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,679
within the

427
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,880
so what does it mean here if the score

428
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,319
force be

429
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,240
false on the left hand

430
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,079
that boundary the alpha right right

431
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,760
because we we are now at this case we

432
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,840
are minimizing it and we're pushing the

433
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,480
beta boundary to the left right i need

434
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,400
to value four speed on the left hand

435
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,080
side of the other

436
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,880
it means that we don't need to continue

437
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,880
right yeah

438
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,120
make sense

439
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,840
okay so this is if you're minimizing it

440
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,679
if you minimizing just

441
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,679
this mini magazines

442
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,320
okay

443
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,000
okay so any questions so far why are we

444
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,000
doing this why are we doing this

445
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,840
any question

446
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,120
so what did i what did they talk about

447
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,720
you talked about

448
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,200
[Music]

449
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,320
about the increase

450
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,320
uh yes and then today

451
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,520
yeah and then we are using this

452
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,760
technology yeah so so

453
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,320
uh it's the other better needs another

454
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,320
two parameter which we need to you know

455
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,039
pass past alpha beta alpha beta okay and

456
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,440
we at each round depending on whether we

457
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,760
are maximizing or minimizing we need to

458
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,360
keep update updating the boundary right

459
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,600
keep updating the boundary which is

460
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,720
other better otherwise less boundary

461
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,600
beta is the right boundary and once if

462
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,679
the value if the current score is either

463
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,440
false on the right on the left-hand side

464
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,919
of boundary or false on the right-hand

465
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,400
side of boundary then it means that

466
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,240
we can just stop searching in a branch

467
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,799
why is that remember if we talk about

468
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,559
that very well three five six nine three

469
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,799
five six nine

470
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
okay

471
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,840
okay

472
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,000
so

473
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,000
can you tell me whether this one is uh

474
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,840
so here this is the five yeah we want to

475
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,240
get the maximum here right

476
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,440
and here would be

477
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,160
and then here would be the minimum

478
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,799
all right again again let's talk about

479
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,000
35 this is fine six

480
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,280
i know i got a i know this x value is at

481
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,600
least

482
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,960
at least bigger than equal than six yeah

483
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,360
yeah i don't i haven't explored this

484
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,640
this bit yet but i know

485
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,880
from here i said this value x

486
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,039
bigger or equal to six right

487
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,120
yeah if it's bigger or equal than six

488
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,080
because this level is trying to minimize

489
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,520
it we have a better value five here yeah

490
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,120
so it means that we don't need to

491
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,200
explore this

492
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,280
yeah because there's no point to

493
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,240
explore this it doesn't change the value

494
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:04,240
of this this uh learner here

495
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,600
eventually i want i want this value here

496
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,799
this value

497
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,159
is 5 i know i know how to feel this

498
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,679
value 5 without exploring it

499
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,520
makes sense

500
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,840
it doesn't change here it doesn't change

501
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,840
why is

502
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,679
that this is maximum five

503
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,520
here is six

504
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,320
i want to get the maximum so this value

505
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,280
x is bigger than equal than six right

506
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,880
if it's bigger or equal than six

507
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,720
it doesn't change the result of five

508
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,880
here because we got a better result a

509
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,720
better value five here this this is

510
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,480
looking for a minimum

511
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,440
make sense

512
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,919
yeah so look this value is bigger than

513
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,120
equal than six so these one

514
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,200
will be

515
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,880
terminated there's no point to keep

516
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,600
doing that right there's no point to

517
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,799
give them it means that this boundary is

518
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,760
what six

519
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,080
uh bigger than equal and six right so x

520
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,640
is bigger than equal and six

521
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,720
so we have a boundary

522
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,480
so we we try it's alpha which is the

523
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,960
beta

524
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,120
which one is the beta which is harder so

525
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:16,400
x is bigger than equal and six

526
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,320
yeah x is bigger than equal and six

527
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,120
huh yeah so

528
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,880
so i i think this is the right boundary

529
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,799
right because it's false on the right

530
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,919
boundary so let's not want to continue

531
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,120
okay

532
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,840
yeah

533
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,200
yeah

534
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,120
okay uh

535
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,480
so there's one

536
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,240
there's another thing to notice is that

537
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,440
you can break

538
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,799
you can put this break after

539
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,919
after the

540
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,720
updating the boundary or before updating

541
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,600
the boundary if we keep we're updating

542
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,440
after the boundary so the result this

543
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,760
whole result will be

544
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,960
that could be possible the value will be

545
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,080
outside

546
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,640
outside yeah the return value could be

547
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,840
outside the boundary so we call it fair

548
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,799
soft

549
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,919
if we

550
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,559
put this before updating the boundary

551
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,440
then the value return will be strictly

552
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,760
inside we call it fair heart

553
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,480
make sense so just this one better and

554
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,400
then

555
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,720
this if statement if statement is to

556
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,039
break to terminate right to terminate

557
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,400
right so if we switch the order that

558
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,400
will be

559
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,039
there will that will make a difference

560
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,600
right so sometimes the value will be you

561
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,320
so to visualize it is that you are here

562
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,480
right

563
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,440
yeah

564
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,720
so

565
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,960
even here if the result value is here

566
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,080
it's within this boundary that is fair

567
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,559
hard because you can't always go outside

568
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,720
but if you say okay let's

569
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,440
you move outside and then you realize

570
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,679
you're outside but you return this value

571
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,679
we call it fair soft make sense because

572
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,559
you're outside the boundary

573
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,159
right

574
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,840
you return that as a value right let's

575
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,360
say that's the difference okay let's

576
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,679
call it fast

577
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,120
fair soft

578
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,120
and then fair hard okay

579
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,640
okay

580
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,799
so this with this alpha beta which one

581
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,280
is better alpha beta or min max which

582
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,880
one is faster

583
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,120
better yeah we're done because we have a

584
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,520
state we have a check if it's four

585
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,880
people outside we just stop searching

586
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,600
and you will accelerate research

587
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,960
without these the same truth could be

588
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,240
huge could be enormous yeah

589
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:40,000
so it will take time yeah remember it'll

590
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,000
be like something like uh you know

591
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,000
so it's another techniques to to do uh

592
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,120
to to speed up the

593
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,679
searching

594
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,640
remember in the fibonacci number yeah

595
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,440
we use the cash to remember the values

596
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,279
we have calculated so we don't

597
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,200
calculate again and again right so

598
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,679
that's another technique to

599
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,440
to speed up the search right

600
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,400
make sense

601
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,799
so instead

602
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,240
this is a slightly different instead of

603
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:12,960
remembering the value for a note we just

604
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,080
discard it because we know

605
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,360
there is no point to exploring

606
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,279
that subtree

607
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,640
it doesn't change the

608
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,919
outcome

609
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,360
why do we need to spend time wasting

610
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:30,799
calculating spending time in the subtree

611
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,279
knowing that it doesn't change the

612
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,960
result

613
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,240
yeah

614
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,200
okay so what have you learned today

615
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,520
what's the most important takeaway you

616
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,520
take it

617
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,880
alphabet

618
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,720
okay can you explain to me can you

619
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,480
explain to me about these

620
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,679
um when you like reduce

621
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,960
the maximum of three and five and five

622
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,480
yeah okay now six nine six and

623
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,320
no matter what happened here six when

624
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,279
you visit six

625
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,159
yeah

626
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,120
um

627
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:12,880
it must be six or over yeah but then

628
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,919
since six is the minimum is six and six

629
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,200
is already over five so

630
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:22,480
so we know the minimum one bird

631
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,159
but overall um result is five

632
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,679
we're done yeah i know you know it yeah

633
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,360
keep practicing your

634
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,440
uh presentation skip i know you

635
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,640
understand okay that's it for today bye

636
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,760
bye

637
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,760
bye bye
