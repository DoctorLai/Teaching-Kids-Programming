three out of ten and we want to come up
 

171
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,910
three out of ten and we want to come up
with the solutions

172
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
with the solutions
 

173
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,630
with the solutions
to pack up to four right so that's one

174
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
to pack up to four right so that's one
 

175
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,509
to pack up to four right so that's one
two three

176
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
two three
 

177
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,309
two three
four five six seven seven okay yeah does

178
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
four five six seven seven okay yeah does
 

179
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,430
four five six seven seven okay yeah does
it make sense look

180
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
it make sense look
 

181
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,550
it make sense look
one three and three one are different

182
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
one three and three one are different
 

183
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,390
one three and three one are different
one one two and two one one are

184
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
one one two and two one one are
 

185
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,110
one one two and two one one are
different all right

186
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
different all right
 

187
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,229
different all right
all right so look so given this

188
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
all right so look so given this
 

189
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,630
all right so look so given this
input one two three and then four take

190
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
input one two three and then four take
 

191
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,270
input one two three and then four take
it you need to tell me it's seven

192
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
it you need to tell me it's seven
 

193
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,589
it you need to tell me it's seven
any idea how we're doing this three four

194
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
any idea how we're doing this three four
 

195
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,429
any idea how we're doing this three four
things how do you profile him come on

196
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
things how do you profile him come on
 

197
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,869
things how do you profile him come on
how do you propose

198
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
how do you propose
 

199
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,390
how do you propose
how

200
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400

 

201
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,789

but the thing is that look this type of

202
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
but the thing is that look this type of
 

203
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,430
but the thing is that look this type of
the

204
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
the
 

205
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,069
the
this type of item you can have a limited

206
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
this type of item you can have a limited
 

207
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,110
this type of item you can have a limited
number of times how

208
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
number of times how
 

209
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:32,950
number of times how
how are you going to profit

210
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960

 

211
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,990

so kind of we can backtrack

212
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
so kind of we can backtrack
 

213
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,469
so kind of we can backtrack
you know backtrack therefore search

214
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
you know backtrack therefore search
 

215
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,909
you know backtrack therefore search

pick this one
 

227
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,469
pick this one
right or not pick this one right

00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
right or not pick this one right
 

229
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,710
right or not pick this one right
if i pick this one i can again pick this

230
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
if i pick this one i can again pick this
 

231
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,749
if i pick this one i can again pick this
one until

232
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
one until
 

233
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,189
one until
it's bigger than the target right

234
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
it's bigger than the target right
 

235
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,670
it's bigger than the target right
yes i'm all right does it have to equal

236
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
yes i'm all right does it have to equal
 

237
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,909
yes i'm all right does it have to equal
four yes it has to be equal for if

238
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
four yes it has to be equal for if
 

239
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,230
four yes it has to be equal for if
it equals to four then i increment the

240
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
it equals to four then i increment the
 

241
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,150
it equals to four then i increment the
answer does it make sense so look

242
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
answer does it make sense so look
 

243
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,350
answer does it make sense so look
so i can i erase look

244
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
so i can i erase look
 

245
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,749
so i can i erase look
look this contrast is that these are

246
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
look this contrast is that these are
 

247
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,189
look this contrast is that these are
unique positive

248
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
unique positive
 

249
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:27,350
unique positive
what happens if there's zero

250
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360

 

251
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,909

unlimited number of times combination

252
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
unlimited number of times combination
 

253
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,390
unlimited number of times combination
right

254
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
right
 

255
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,029
right
because you can put zero and zero zero

256
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
because you can put zero and zero zero
 

257
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,469
because you can put zero and zero zero
zero zero little bit

258
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
zero zero little bit
 

259
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,830
zero zero little bit
unlimited number of combination am right

260
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
unlimited number of combination am right
 

261
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,830
unlimited number of combination am right
and how about negative numbers

262
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
and how about negative numbers
 

263
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,790
and how about negative numbers
look if if it's one and minus one there

264
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
look if if it's one and minus one there
 

265
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,749
look if if it's one and minus one there
are two

266
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
are two
 

267
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,430
are two
and then you want to sum up with target

268
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
and then you want to sum up with target
 

269
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,950
and then you want to sum up with target
zero how many

270
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
zero how many
 

271
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,510
zero how many
how many possibilities you'll be

272
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
how many possibilities you'll be
 

273
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,230
how many possibilities you'll be
unlimited

274
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
unlimited
 

275
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,550
unlimited
right one minus one yeah and then you

276
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
right one minus one yeah and then you
 

277
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,990
right one minus one yeah and then you
can add one minus one

278
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
can add one minus one
 

279
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,749
can add one minus one
and you can add one minus one so you get

280
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
and you can add one minus one so you get
 

281
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,070
and you can add one minus one so you get
it so you'll be one plus minus one plus

282
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
it so you'll be one plus minus one plus
 

283
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,790
it so you'll be one plus minus one plus
one times

284
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
one times
 

285
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,309
one times
plus minus right you can keep adding

286
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
plus minus right you can keep adding
 

287
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,070
plus minus right you can keep adding
that and then that's another

288
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
that and then that's another
 

289
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,590
that and then that's another
combination right so it doesn't make

290
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
combination right so it doesn't make
 

291
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,110
combination right so it doesn't make
sense so that's why we said it's unique

292
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
sense so that's why we said it's unique
 

293
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,110
sense so that's why we said it's unique
positive all right

294
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
positive all right
 

295
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,070
positive all right
all right okay so for comment coming

296
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
all right okay so for comment coming
 

297
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,790
all right okay so for comment coming

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,110
of status search
for each item we are picking we were

304
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
for each item we are picking we were
 

305
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,670
for each item we are picking we were
picking

306
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
picking
 

307
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,070
picking
for the next item i can try to pick this

308
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
for the next item i can try to pick this
 

309
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,110
for the next item i can try to pick this
item right

310
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
item right
 

311
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,909
item right
if it's no if it's if the total weight

312
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:23,919
if it's no if it's if the total weight
 

313
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,550
if it's no if it's if the total weight
is still

314
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
is still
 

315
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,309
is still
less than the maximum weight we can

316
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
less than the maximum weight we can
 

317
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,150
less than the maximum weight we can
take right yeah and then

318
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
take right yeah and then
 

319
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,189
take right yeah and then
i know what's next if i pick this one i

320
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
i know what's next if i pick this one i
 

321
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,550
i know what's next if i pick this one i
can keep picking this one

322
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
can keep picking this one
 

323
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,270
can keep picking this one
right and here it's more like that oh i

324
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
right and here it's more like that oh i
 

325
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,670
right and here it's more like that oh i
can start picking the next one right

326
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
can start picking the next one right
 

327
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,390
can start picking the next one right
all right until okay so let's try the

328
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
all right until okay so let's try the
 

329
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,390
all right until okay so let's try the
sugarcoat okay let's let's see the dough

330
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
sugarcoat okay let's let's see the dough
 

331
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,710
sugarcoat okay let's let's see the dough
but it's very inefficient right because

332
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
but it's very inefficient right because
 

333
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,990
but it's very inefficient right because
you

334
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
you
 

335
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,830
you
you keep trying and keep trying and here

336
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
you keep trying and keep trying and here
 

337
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,270
you keep trying and keep trying and here
look yeah

338
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
look yeah
 

339
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,550
look yeah
right all right pick yeah pick okay

340
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
right all right pick yeah pick okay
 

341
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,950
right all right pick yeah pick okay
pick we are we we're gonna pick the

342
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
pick we are we we're gonna pick the
 

343
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,629
pick we are we we're gonna pick the
formula numbers

344
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
formula numbers
 

345
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,430
formula numbers
and let's start from picking the index

346
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
and let's start from picking the index
 

347
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:03,830
and let's start from picking the index
from

348
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
from
 

349
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,189
from
i yeah let's say from i and then

350
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
i yeah let's say from i and then
 

351
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,950
i yeah let's say from i and then
currently we need to pick the target

352
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
currently we need to pick the target
 

353
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,710
currently we need to pick the target
right right yeah

354
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
right right yeah
 

355
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,309
right right yeah
target and then we have uh

356
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
target and then we have uh
 

357
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,110
target and then we have uh
we have an answer we we have count

358
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
we have an answer we we have count
 

359
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,749
we have an answer we we have count
answer

360
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
answer
 

361
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,830
answer
currently equals zero right i'm right

362
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
currently equals zero right i'm right
 

363
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,350
currently equals zero right i'm right
okay so now look

364
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
okay so now look
 

365
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,710
okay so now look
t is the number of total weight we still

366
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
t is the number of total weight we still
 

367
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,790
t is the number of total weight we still
have to pick right now look

368
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
have to pick right now look
 

369
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,070
have to pick right now look
if t is zero what do we do

370
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
if t is zero what do we do
 

371
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,790
if t is zero what do we do
we increment answer equal plus equals

372
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
we increment answer equal plus equals
 

373
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,550
we increment answer equal plus equals
one and we tend right

374
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
one and we tend right
 

375
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,909
one and we tend right
does it make sense yeah look if if

376
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
does it make sense yeah look if if
 

377
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,790
does it make sense yeah look if if
there's there's nothing to pick if the

378
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
there's there's nothing to pick if the
 

379
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,510
there's there's nothing to pick if the
the back

380
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
the back
 

381
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,629
the back
it has empty space left right and empty

382
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
it has empty space left right and empty
 

383
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,029
it has empty space left right and empty
weight

384
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
weight
 

385
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,070
weight
left right yeah t is the

386
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
left right yeah t is the
 

387
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,510
left right yeah t is the
weight entry no we increment the answer

388
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
weight entry no we increment the answer
 

389
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,189
weight entry no we increment the answer
right does it make sense eric okay then

390
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
right does it make sense eric okay then
 

391
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,029
right does it make sense eric okay then
we can pick we can start we can start

392
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039
we can pick we can start we can start
 

393
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,390
we can pick we can start we can start
from uh let's let's

394
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
from uh let's let's
 

395
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,029
from uh let's let's
make it left okay so we we have this one

396
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
make it left okay so we we have this one
 

397
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:05,909
make it left okay so we we have this one
two three

398
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
two three
 

399
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,070
two three
at the beginning we start with zero uh

400
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
at the beginning we start with zero uh
 

401
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,309
at the beginning we start with zero uh
index zero okay so now we can say

402
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
index zero okay so now we can say
 

403
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,589
index zero okay so now we can say
for i in range

404
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
for i in range
 

405
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,029
for i in range
left yeah we still can pick the left and

406
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
left yeah we still can pick the left and
 

407
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,189
left yeah we still can pick the left and
and what kill the length of lumps yeah

408
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
and what kill the length of lumps yeah
 

409
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,350
and what kill the length of lumps yeah
then sometimes

410
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
then sometimes
 

411
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,869
then sometimes
okay and then now what look i know

412
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879

 

413
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,909

if if nouns

414
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
if if nouns
 

415
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,430
if if nouns
i

416
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440

 

417
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,430

if norms i is the

418
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
if norms i is the
 

419
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,110
if norms i is the
weight of the this item is smaller

420
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
weight of the this item is smaller
 

421
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,230
weight of the this item is smaller
than that or equal than the target right

422
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
than that or equal than the target right
 

423
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,150
than that or equal than the target right
right it means we can pick it then we

424
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
right it means we can pick it then we
 

425
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,430
right it means we can pick it then we
can do this one

426
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
can do this one
 

427
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,630
can do this one
we can do this pick

428
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
we can do this pick
 

429
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,670
we can do this pick
click pick i

430
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
click pick i
 

431
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,870
click pick i
yeah i'll pick nums okay

432
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
yeah i'll pick nums okay
 

433
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,350
yeah i'll pick nums okay
and then we can pick still picking this

434
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
and then we can pick still picking this
 

435
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,829
and then we can pick still picking this
number

436
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839

 

437
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,990

and i y and then t

438
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
and i y and then t
 

439
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,990
and i y and then t
minus nums i right

440
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000

 

441
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,910

why right

442
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920

 

443
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,350

look if if none if this item

444
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
look if if none if this item
 

445
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,190
look if if none if this item
is smaller than the target now we can

446
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
is smaller than the target now we can
 

447
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,350
is smaller than the target now we can
pick it right we can pick it

448
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
pick it right we can pick it
 

449
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,630
pick it right we can pick it
right all right yes and then we need to

450
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
right all right yes and then we need to
 

451
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,550
right all right yes and then we need to
then that's it and actually that's it

452
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
then that's it and actually that's it
 

453
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,470
then that's it and actually that's it
because i will be wrapping up with

454
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
because i will be wrapping up with
 

455
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,550
because i will be wrapping up with
iterating from left to left right even

456
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
iterating from left to left right even
 

457
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,389
iterating from left to left right even
smaller even smaller

458
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
smaller even smaller
 

459
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,470
smaller even smaller
right if it's smaller t

460
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
right if it's smaller t
 

461
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,030
right if it's smaller t
pick t and then the next iteration for

462
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
pick t and then the next iteration for
 

463
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,230
pick t and then the next iteration for
example left uh

464
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
example left uh
 

465
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,110
example left uh
left last one you will pick it you will

466
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
left last one you will pick it you will
 

467
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,710
left last one you will pick it you will
need to kick it and then

468
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
need to kick it and then
 

469
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,590
need to kick it and then
right yeah yeah so that's it so look

470
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
right yeah yeah so that's it so look
 

471
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,389
right yeah yeah so that's it so look
this is

472
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
this is
 

473
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,910
this is
called the uh backtracking yeah

474
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
called the uh backtracking yeah
 

475
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,110
called the uh backtracking yeah
so so it's very uh how

476
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
so so it's very uh how
 

477
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,710
so so it's very uh how
you simulate the process

478
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
you simulate the process
 

479
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,949
you simulate the process
yeah it simulates the process of picking

480
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
yeah it simulates the process of picking
 

481
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,710
yeah it simulates the process of picking
right for each one you can pick or not

482
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
right for each one you can pick or not
 

483
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,190
right for each one you can pick or not
pick

484
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
pick
 

485
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,110
pick
right you can keep picking picking until

486
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
right you can keep picking picking until
 

487
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,430
right you can keep picking picking until
it's smaller it's yellow or

488
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
it's smaller it's yellow or
 

489
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,069
it's smaller it's yellow or
or look if it's not yellow if you're not

490
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
or look if it's not yellow if you're not
 

491
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,550
or look if it's not yellow if you're not
yellow then i have to say look uh

492
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
yellow then i have to say look uh
 

493
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,470
yellow then i have to say look uh
do i need to check if it's more uh if

494
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
do i need to check if it's more uh if
 

495
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,949
do i need to check if it's more uh if
it's less than yellow or no

496
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
it's less than yellow or no
 

497
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,269
it's less than yellow or no
if you can't pick it if i pick it that's

498
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
if you can't pick it if i pick it that's
 

499
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,470
if you can't pick it if i pick it that's
fine but but

500
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
fine but but
 

501
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,550
fine but but
look if you don't check this what will

502
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
look if you don't check this what will
 

503
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,750
look if you don't check this what will
happen if you can pick

504
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
happen if you can pick
 

505
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,470
happen if you can pick
when this will cream could be negative

506
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
when this will cream could be negative
 

507
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,630
when this will cream could be negative
then you say here if t is smaller than

508
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
then you say here if t is smaller than
 

509
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,430
then you say here if t is smaller than
zero

510
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
zero
 

511
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,630
zero
let's return right right return right

512
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
let's return right right return right
 

513
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,829
let's return right right return right
because

514
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
because
 

515
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,069
because
for i in range i try to pick but it's

516
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
for i in range i try to pick but it's
 

517
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,350
for i in range i try to pick but it's
smaller

518
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
smaller
 

519
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,670
smaller
it's smaller it means that this current

520
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
it's smaller it means that this current
 

521
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,269
it's smaller it means that this current
item is more than the

522
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
item is more than the
 

523
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,670
item is more than the
remaining weight right capacity of the

524
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
remaining weight right capacity of the
 

525
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,670
remaining weight right capacity of the
bag then i need to return

526
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
bag then i need to return
 

527
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,710
bag then i need to return
right yes all right so look this is the

528
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
right yes all right so look this is the
 

529
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,269
right yes all right so look this is the
front

530
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
front
 

531
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,430
front
in global counter we are only

532
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
in global counter we are only
 

533
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,030
in global counter we are only
increment the answer we will only

534
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
increment the answer we will only
 

535
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,230
increment the answer we will only
increment an answer

536
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
increment an answer
 

537
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,790
increment an answer
if t is zero it means that we have

538
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
if t is zero it means that we have
 

539
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,269
if t is zero it means that we have
packed

540
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
packed
 

541
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,389
packed
exactly t weight right

542
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
exactly t weight right
 

543
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,269
exactly t weight right
all right the target yeah yeah okay so

544
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
all right the target yeah yeah okay so
 

545
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,470
all right the target yeah yeah okay so
this is one solution

546
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
this is one solution
 

547
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,470
this is one solution
but let's do another solution which is

548
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
but let's do another solution which is
 

549
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,310
but let's do another solution which is
better remember

550
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
better remember
 

551
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,829
better remember
remember what have we taught

552
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
remember what have we taught
 

553
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,829
remember what have we taught
we learned before we have learned before

554
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
we learned before we have learned before
 

555
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,750
we learned before we have learned before
so all right

556
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
so all right
 

557
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,790
so all right
so how about if i say f function f n

558
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
so how about if i say f function f n
 

559
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,230
so how about if i say f function f n
is the number of number of solutions

560
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
is the number of number of solutions
 

561
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,990
is the number of number of solutions
that combination that we can pack item n

562
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
that combination that we can pack item n
 

563
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,030
that combination that we can pack item n
right we take the weight

564
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
right we take the weight
 

565
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,910
right we take the weight
and this and this enough so does it so i

566
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
and this and this enough so does it so i
 

567
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,310
and this and this enough so does it so i
have

568
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
have
 

569
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,910
have
numbers i have numbers like one

570
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
numbers i have numbers like one
 

571
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,230
numbers i have numbers like one
two three right right one two c these

572
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
two three right right one two c these
 

573
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,430
two three right right one two c these
three yeah

574
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
three yeah
 

575
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,790
three yeah
so look at the fn let's say f4 remember

576
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
so look at the fn let's say f4 remember
 

577
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,110
so look at the fn let's say f4 remember
this type is four right

578
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
this type is four right
 

579
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,230
this type is four right
so i want to know f4 right i want to

580
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
so i want to know f4 right i want to
 

581
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,350
so i want to know f4 right i want to
know f4 right is it equal

582
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
know f4 right is it equal
 

583
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,710
know f4 right is it equal
to the sum sum

584
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
to the sum sum
 

585
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,150
to the sum sum
of f four minus one

586
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
of f four minus one
 

587
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,430
of f four minus one
plus f four minus two plus f

588
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
plus f four minus two plus f
 

589
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,990
plus f four minus two plus f
four minus three doesn't make sense yeah

590
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
four minus three doesn't make sense yeah
 

591
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,509
four minus three doesn't make sense yeah
look because it's 24 yeah

592
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
look because it's 24 yeah
 

593
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,430
look because it's 24 yeah
so i want to get the total item to four

594
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
so i want to get the total item to four
 

595
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,069
so i want to get the total item to four
but i know i have one two three right so

596
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
but i know i have one two three right so
 

597
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,990
but i know i have one two three right so
if i get the f

598
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
if i get the f
 

599
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,910
if i get the f
if i have the last item i put is one

600
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
if i have the last item i put is one
 

601
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,990
if i have the last item i put is one
then i have this solution if it's two

602
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
then i have this solution if it's two
 

603
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,750
then i have this solution if it's two
it's like this solution if three is

604
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
it's like this solution if three is
 

605
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,190
it's like this solution if three is
listed

606
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
listed
 

607
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,509
listed
is it like climbing stairs remember

608
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
is it like climbing stairs remember
 

609
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,030
is it like climbing stairs remember
remember we have talked about the

610
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
remember we have talked about the
 

611
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,949
remember we have talked about the
climbing stairs yeah

612
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
climbing stairs yeah
 

613
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,030
climbing stairs yeah
the first one you can jump one step or

614
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
the first one you can jump one step or
 

615
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,310
the first one you can jump one step or
two step right

616
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
two step right
 

617
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,949
two step right
yeah remember yeah and you want to reach

618
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
yeah remember yeah and you want to reach
 

619
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:55,829
yeah remember yeah and you want to reach
the end step

620
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
the end step
 

621
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,750
the end step
then how many ways can you do it you can

622
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
then how many ways can you do it you can
 

623
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,590
then how many ways can you do it you can
think of this the last way

624
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
think of this the last way
 

625
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,550
think of this the last way
in order to reach the step end you have

626
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
in order to reach the step end you have
 

627
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,269
in order to reach the step end you have
you can

628
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
you can
 

629
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,829
you can
jump to the n minus one step and a minus

630
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
jump to the n minus one step and a minus
 

631
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,750
jump to the n minus one step and a minus
two step at a time right

632
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
two step at a time right
 

633
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,310
two step at a time right
yeah the two possibility you if you want

634
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
yeah the two possibility you if you want
 

635
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,190
yeah the two possibility you if you want
to reach n

636
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
to reach n
 

637
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,670
to reach n
from here uh you if you're going to

638
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
from here uh you if you're going to
 

639
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,629
from here uh you if you're going to
reach n

640
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
reach n
 

641
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,550
reach n
then how many possibilities the previous

642
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
then how many possibilities the previous
 

643
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,150
then how many possibilities the previous
step you can

644
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
step you can
 

645
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,230
step you can
jump on the n minus one and i'm minus

646
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
jump on the n minus one and i'm minus
 

647
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,910
jump on the n minus one and i'm minus
two right

648
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
two right
 

649
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,389
two right
and then once here you can jump one step

650
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
and then once here you can jump one step
 

651
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,030
and then once here you can jump one step
or two straight

652
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
or two straight
 

653
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,550
or two straight
this is the same better thinking

654
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
this is the same better thinking
 

655
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,509
this is the same better thinking
backwards so in order to pack the

656
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
backwards so in order to pack the
 

657
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,710
backwards so in order to pack the
weight four i can take the last one

658
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
weight four i can take the last one
 

659
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,990
weight four i can take the last one
which is one

660
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
which is one
 

661
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,190
which is one
or two or three right as long as it's

662
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
or two or three right as long as it's
 

663
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,310
or two or three right as long as it's
smaller

664
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
smaller
 

665

and f your and e 0
 

731
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,590

is n is smaller than zero

is n is smaller than zero

because
 

745
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,509
because
you've got nothing there's one solution

746
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
you've got nothing there's one solution

to pack nothing right
 

749
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,350
to pack nothing right
all right all right so this is the

750
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
all right all right so this is the
 

751
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,550
all right all right so this is the
recursion

752
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
recursion
 

753
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,470

do you do you recall yeah yeah and the
 

759
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,470
do you do you recall yeah yeah and the
terminal condition is

760
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
terminal condition is
 

761
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,910
terminal condition is
f n is is yellow if n is smaller than

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
f n is is yellow if n is smaller than
 

763
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,470
f n is is yellow if n is smaller than
zero because there's no way to pack

764
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480

765
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,350

negative weight am i right yeah and f of

766
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
negative weight am i right yeah and f of
 

767
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,790
negative weight am i right yeah and f of
zero is one because

768
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
zero is one because
 

769
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,710
zero is one because
there's only one way to pack nothing

770
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
there's only one way to pack nothing
 

771
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,189
there's only one way to pack nothing
yeah if you have an empty knapsack

772
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
yeah if you have an empty knapsack
 

773
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,749
yeah if you have an empty knapsack
that's only one solution right yeah does

774
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
that's only one solution right yeah does
 

775
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,189
that's only one solution right yeah does
it make sense

776
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
it make sense
 

777
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,870
it make sense
yeah but remember the items are unique

778
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:56,880
yeah but remember the items are unique
 

779
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,670
yeah but remember the items are unique
positive right it only works for the

780
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
positive right it only works for the
 

781
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,269
positive right it only works for the
unique positive if it's

782
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
unique positive if it's
 

783
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,790
unique positive if it's
negative it doesn't work okay

784
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
negative it doesn't work okay
 

785
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,790
negative it doesn't work okay
so let's talk about the top down first

look remember we're counting the stairs
 

821
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,230
look remember we're counting the stairs
to end

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
to end
 

823
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,270
to end
and we can every time we can climb

824
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280
and we can every time we can climb
 

825
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,510
and we can every time we can climb
the steps in the numbers yeah it's like

826
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:13,520
the steps in the numbers yeah it's like
 

827
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,669
the steps in the numbers yeah it's like
we can pack the items in uh

828
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
we can pack the items in uh
 

829
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,309
we can pack the items in uh
using these items in you know different

830
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
using these items in you know different
 

831
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,590
using these items in you know different
items right

832
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
items right
 

833
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,829
items right
right and then how many ways are doing

834
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
right and then how many ways are doing
 

835
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,150
right and then how many ways are doing
that so we add it all together and we

836
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
that so we add it all together and we
 

837
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,350
that so we add it all together and we
can answer

838
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
can answer
 

839
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,590
can answer
i need what's this case doing here

840
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
i need what's this case doing here
 

841
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,430
i need what's this case doing here
what's this case doing

842
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
what's this case doing
 

843
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,909
what's this case doing
do you remember to remember because we

844
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:31,919
do you remember to remember because we
 

845
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,630
do you remember to remember because we
are

846
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
are
 

847
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,230
are
calculating these f numbers yeah

848
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
calculating these f numbers yeah
 

849
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,070
calculating these f numbers yeah
over and over again so this is top down

850
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,080
over and over again so this is top down
 

851
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,510
over and over again so this is top down
because if in order to calculate

852
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
because if in order to calculate
 

853
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,310
because if in order to calculate
everything

854
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
everything
 

855
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,029
everything
we need to take the f m minus all the

856
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
we need to take the f m minus all the
 

857
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,950
we need to take the f m minus all the
items which is smaller this is top down

858
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960
items which is smaller this is top down
 

859
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,430
items which is smaller this is top down
right

860
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
right
 

861
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,230
right
yeah it will be extremely little

862
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
yeah it will be extremely little
 

863
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,590
yeah it will be extremely little
whatever you say

864
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
whatever you say
 

865
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,909
whatever you say
exponential okay okay the complexity

866
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
exponential okay okay the complexity
 

867
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,669
exponential okay okay the complexity
but with the cash the the fn

868
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
but with the cash the the fn
 

869
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,750
but with the cash the the fn
we always cache the numbers f0 to fn we

870
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760
we always cache the numbers f0 to fn we
 

871
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,590
we always cache the numbers f0 to fn we
only calculate each number every

872
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
only calculate each number every
 

873
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,590
only calculate each number every
function only once right

874
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600
function only once right
 

875
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,830
function only once right
so what's the term uh what's the

876
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
so what's the term uh what's the
 

877
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,110
so what's the term uh what's the
complexity of this one

878
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120

 

879
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,110

um

880
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120

 

881
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,190

maybe it's not obvious look we have a

882
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
maybe it's not obvious look we have a
 

883
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,909
maybe it's not obvious look we have a
four here and we're doing this so

884
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
four here and we're doing this so
 

885
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,950
four here and we're doing this so
it's the same as the look n is the

886
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
it's the same as the look n is the
 

887
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,470
it's the same as the look n is the
target and

888
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
target and
 

889
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,909
target and
let's say let's say this is t okay ft

890
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:29,919
let's say let's say this is t okay ft
 

891
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,430
let's say let's say this is t okay ft
t okay let's do this maybe

892
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440

 

893
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,029

okay okay then and something to do with

894
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
okay okay then and something to do with
 

895
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,669
okay okay then and something to do with
t

896
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
t
 

897
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,029
t
o t times the length of the length of

898
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
o t times the length of the length of
 

899
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,350
o t times the length of the length of
the numbers right

900
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360

 

901
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,909

because t we need to calculate t f t

902
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
because t we need to calculate t f t
 

903
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,710
because t we need to calculate t f t
f zero f one f two f three until f t

904
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
f zero f one f two f three until f t
 

905
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,190
f zero f one f two f three until f t
yeah that's

906
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
yeah that's
 

907
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,750
yeah that's
for sure yeah for each one i need to

908
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
for sure yeah for each one i need to
 

909
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,110
for sure yeah for each one i need to
iterate

910
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
iterate
 

911
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,230
iterate
numbers numbers here that will be length

912
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
numbers numbers here that will be length
 

913
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,310
numbers numbers here that will be length
of numbers does it make sense yes

914
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
of numbers does it make sense yes
 

915
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,669
of numbers does it make sense yes
okay okay okay

916
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
okay okay okay
 

917
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,710
okay okay okay
let's do another one bottom yeah so in

918
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
let's do another one bottom yeah so in
 

919
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,029
let's do another one bottom yeah so in
order to calculate which value we are we

920
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
order to calculate which value we are we
 

921
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,710
order to calculate which value we are we
need to we need to calculate it first

922
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
need to we need to calculate it first
 

923
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,029
need to we need to calculate it first
we also calculate the f we calculate

924
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
we also calculate the f we calculate
 

925
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,150
we also calculate the f we calculate
from f 0

926
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
from f 0
 

927
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,830
from f 0
f 1 f 2 until we get a f t i'm right

928
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
f 1 f 2 until we get a f t i'm right
 

929
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,350
f 1 f 2 until we get a f t i'm right
yeah okay can i have your attention

930
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,360
yeah okay can i have your attention
 

931
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,990
yeah okay can i have your attention
please

932
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
please
 

933
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,909
please
okay look defined let's say

934
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
okay look defined let's say
 

935
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,710
okay look defined let's say
uh let's let's just say f function okay

936
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
uh let's let's just say f function okay
 

937
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,870
uh let's let's just say f function okay
something we have num

938
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
something we have num
 

939
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,230
something we have num
okay and i have a target yeah

940
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240

 

941
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,310

look we have the bottom up we need to

942
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
look we have the bottom up we need to
 

943
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,470
look we have the bottom up we need to
store these f functions in a

944
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
store these f functions in a
 

945
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,270
store these f functions in a
array right let's call it dp array okay

946
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
array right let's call it dp array okay
 

947
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,150
array right let's call it dp array okay
and look

948
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,160
and look
 

949
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,430
and look
and is length of num right

950
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
and is length of num right
 

951
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,710
and is length of num right
okay all right

952
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
okay all right
 

953
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,350
okay all right
so let's step here right is it size of n

954
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
so let's step here right is it size of n
 

955
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,549
so let's step here right is it size of n
or size of t

956
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
or size of t
 

957
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,510
or size of t
all right all right i'm asking

958
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520

 

959
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,789

so yeah because we um to know the

960
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:06,799
so yeah because we um to know the
 

961
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,909
so yeah because we um to know the
value d p 0 d v 1 d 2 under d b

962
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
value d p 0 d v 1 d 2 under d b
 

963
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,149
value d p 0 d v 1 d 2 under d b
t and the result is in each value

964
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
t and the result is in each value
 

965
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,270
t and the result is in each value
the result is in which value p p

966
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
the result is in which value p p
 

967
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,870
the result is in which value p p
equals 0 times t plus 1 okay because

968
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
equals 0 times t plus 1 okay because
 

969
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,270
equals 0 times t plus 1 okay because
then

970
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
then
 

971
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,430
then
we want to get the dp value those are

972
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
we want to get the dp value those are
 

973
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,149
we want to get the dp value those are
the results is in which value alright

974
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:26,159
the results is in which value alright
 

975
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,430
the results is in which value alright
the results in which value dp dp which

976
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:29,440
the results in which value dp dp which
 

977
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,950
the results in which value dp dp which
value the first value on the last

978
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,960

 

979
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,789

uh value it's the

980
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:36,799
uh value it's the
 

981
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,510
uh value it's the
dp is the look is the f function right

982
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520
dp is the look is the f function right
 

983
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,430
dp is the look is the f function right
it's the same as a function

984
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
it's the same as a function
 

985
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,110
it's the same as a function
so tp what db or we already dp 0

986
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,120
so tp what db or we already dp 0
 

987
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,830
so tp what db or we already dp 0
db1 db2 dbt which one is the value we

988
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:47,840
db1 db2 dbt which one is the value we
 

989
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,350
db1 db2 dbt which one is the value we
are looking for

990
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
are looking for
 

991
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,390
are looking for
we are looking for the dpua

992
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:54,400
we are looking for the dpua
 

993
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,270
we are looking for the dpua
come on db 0 is the way to pack

994
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280

 

995
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,430

not tl1t because t plus one is that the

996
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
not tl1t because t plus one is that the
 

997
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,470
not tl1t because t plus one is that the
the the size of the array is dp is t

998
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
the the size of the array is dp is t
 

999
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,470
the the size of the array is dp is t
plus one but we are actually using db

1000
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,480
plus one but we are actually using db
 

1001
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,669
plus one but we are actually using db
zero to dbt

1002
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
zero to dbt
 

1003
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,590
zero to dbt
right so there are t plus one element so

1004
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
right so there are t plus one element so
 

1005
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,190
right so there are t plus one element so
the result is in dp

1006
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
the result is in dp
 

1007
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,669
the result is in dp
t which all you can do is p minus one

1008
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
t which all you can do is p minus one
 

1009
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,549
t which all you can do is p minus one
right remember

1010
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
right remember
 

1011
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,789
right remember
yeah the last element okay now the first

1012
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799
yeah the last element okay now the first
 

1013
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,270
yeah the last element okay now the first
one tp0 is actually one right

1014
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,280
one tp0 is actually one right
 

1015
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,390
one tp0 is actually one right
we're talking about right yes yeah yeah

1016
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
we're talking about right yes yeah yeah
 

1017
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,149
we're talking about right yes yeah yeah
doesn't make sense because there's only

1018
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
doesn't make sense because there's only
 

1019
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,669
doesn't make sense because there's only
one way to pack

1020
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679
one way to pack
 

1021
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,909
one way to pack
empty bag right if you put nothing you

1022
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:29,919
empty bag right if you put nothing you
 

1023
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,149
empty bag right if you put nothing you
know back there's one solution yeah

1024
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
know back there's one solution yeah
 

1025
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,190
know back there's one solution yeah
and now four i

1026
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200
and now four i
 

1027
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,029
and now four i
i i invent one

1028
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
i i invent one
 

1029
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,310
i i invent one
the first term is one two t

1030
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
the first term is one two t
 

1031
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,590
the first term is one two t
plus one yeah we want to calculate dpi

1032
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
plus one yeah we want to calculate dpi
 

1033
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,909
plus one yeah we want to calculate dpi
from i will be from one to t all right

1034
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
from i will be from one to t all right
 

1035
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,510

all right inclusive

1036
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,520
all right inclusive
 

1037
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,710
all right inclusive
and we need to increasing o j

1038
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
and we need to increasing o j
 

1039
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,510
and we need to increasing o j
in numbers yeah we want to know we want

1040
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
in numbers yeah we want to know we want
 

1041
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:55,830
in numbers yeah we want to know we want
to

1042
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:55,840
to
 

1043
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,390
to
iterate all the numbers items in the

1044
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,400
iterate all the numbers items in the
 

1045
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,470
iterate all the numbers items in the
numbers yeah the different ways

1046
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,480
numbers yeah the different ways
 

1047
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,470
numbers yeah the different ways
then if i is bigger or equal to z

1048
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
then if i is bigger or equal to z
 

1049
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,669
then if i is bigger or equal to z
what does it mean we can pack j in

1050
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
what does it mean we can pack j in
 

1051
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,510
what does it mean we can pack j in
in a bag right yeah so dp i

1052
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
in a bag right yeah so dp i
 

1053
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:24,070
in a bag right yeah so dp i
plus equal y dpy can you tell me

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080

 

1055
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,549

a little bit close okay i i want to pick

1056
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:26,559
a little bit close okay i i want to pick
 

1057
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,909
a little bit close okay i i want to pick
them this is the

1058
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
them this is the
 

1059
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,870
them this is the
i want to calculate dpi and then now i

1060
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880
i want to calculate dpi and then now i
 

1061
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,510
i want to calculate dpi and then now i
can

1062
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
can
 

1063
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,310
can
i find out that the j i we can pick the

1064
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
i find out that the j i we can pick the
 

1065
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,630
i find out that the j i we can pick the
j

1066
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:34,640
j
 

1067
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,909
j
in in the back so what is equal remember

1068
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:37,919
in in the back so what is equal remember
 

1069
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,110
in in the back so what is equal remember
f4 equals

1070
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,120
f4 equals
 

1071
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,149
f4 equals
f4 minus 1 plus f4 minus 2 plus data

1072
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:44,159
f4 minus 1 plus f4 minus 2 plus data
 

1073
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,270
f4 minus 1 plus f4 minus 2 plus data
so this this n is i and this

1074
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
so this this n is i and this
 

1075
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,029
so this this n is i and this
this is an item

1113
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,549

yeah t you can put a t or minus one is

1114
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
yeah t you can put a t or minus one is
 

1115
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,990
yeah t you can put a t or minus one is
the same thing okay

1116
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
the same thing okay
 

1117
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,230
the same thing okay
yeah because t is the last value minus

1118
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,240
yeah because t is the last value minus
 

1119
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,230
yeah because t is the last value minus
one is the last variable

1120
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
one is the last variable
 

1121
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,390
one is the last variable
dv zero is one because there's only one

1145
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,310
item with weight drain then
the solution must be added

1146
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,320
the solution must be added
 

1147
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,950
the solution must be added
dbi minus j right yeah because i already

1148
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
dbi minus j right yeah because i already
 

1149
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,070
dbi minus j right yeah because i already
packed this j

1150
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
packed this j
 

1151
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,870
packed this j
then i i need to take the j out of the

1152
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
then i i need to take the j out of the
 

1153
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,070
then i i need to take the j out of the
maximum weight i

1154
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
maximum weight i
 

1155
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,830
maximum weight i
right does it make sense

1156
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
right does it make sense
 

1157
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,110
right does it make sense

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
the communist stale fn equals fn minus
 

1159
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,909
the communist stale fn equals fn minus
one plus

1160
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
one plus
 

1161
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,110
one plus
fn minus two right or using and

1162
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,120
fn minus two right or using and
 

1163
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,990
fn minus two right or using and
s minus three if you can work one step

1164
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
s minus three if you can work one step
 

1165
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,990
s minus three if you can work one step
two step or three step at the same if

1166
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
two step or three step at the same if
 

1167
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,789
two step or three step at the same if
you want to climb up to n stair

1168
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
you want to climb up to n stair
 

1169
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,310
you want to climb up to n stair
yeah so the previous state would be

1170
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
yeah so the previous state would be
 

1171
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,789
yeah so the previous state would be
minus one

1172
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799
minus one
 

1173
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,310
minus one
yeah you have you are here this is the

1174
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320
yeah you have you are here this is the
 

1175
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,950
yeah you have you are here this is the
top

1176
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:10,960
top
 

1177
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,029
top
you can go to right here go to here or

1178
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
you can go to right here go to here or
 

1179
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:13,990
you can go to right here go to here or
go to here

1180
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
go to here
 

1181
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,070
go to here
after reaching these three steps you can

1182
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
after reaching these three steps you can
 

1183
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,230
after reaching these three steps you can
all jump to the here right

1184
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
all jump to the here right
 

1185
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,029
all jump to the here right
all right so that's the number of ways

1186
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:21,039
all right so that's the number of ways
 

1187
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:21,909
all right so that's the number of ways
to reach the

1188
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:21,919
to reach the
 

1189
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,029
to reach the
item a stereo end it's similar i want to

1190
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:25,039
item a stereo end it's similar i want to
 

1191
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,630
item a stereo end it's similar i want to
pack the item

1192
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
pack the item
 

1193
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,149
pack the item
up to weight n and i can pick one

1194
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:30,159
up to weight n and i can pick one
 

1195
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,510
up to weight n and i can pick one
item pick all the items j yeah numbers

1196
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
item pick all the items j yeah numbers
 

1197
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,590
item pick all the items j yeah numbers
if you like this number is one two three

1198
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
if you like this number is one two three
 

1199
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,230
if you like this number is one two three
right

1200
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
right
 

1201
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,990
right
and you iterate the numbers one two

1202
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
and you iterate the numbers one two
 

1203
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,390
and you iterate the numbers one two
three and you'll be the same as

1204
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400
three and you'll be the same as
 

1205
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,149
three and you'll be the same as
fm minus one f n minus two and

1206
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
fm minus one f n minus two and
 

1207
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,149
fm minus one f n minus two and
minus zero j will be g one two three

1208
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:46,159
minus zero j will be g one two three
 

1209
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,190
minus zero j will be g one two three

know what to do
you don't really know what to ask so you

1286
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
you don't really know what to ask so you
 

1287
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,389
you don't really know what to ask so you
understand everything

1288

understand everything right
not really not really know why you don't

1294
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:33,520
not really not really know why you don't
 

1295
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,269
not really not really know why you don't
you ask you don't understand you don't

1296
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:35,279
you ask you don't understand you don't
 

1297
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:41,750
you ask you don't understand you don't
want to ask

1298
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760

 

1299
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,909

so which one you think you will remember

1300
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:43,919
so which one you think you will remember
 

1301
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,029
so which one you think you will remember
it

1302
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
it
 

1303
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,269
it
you understand it better the top down or

1304
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:47,279
you understand it better the top down or
 

1305
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,430
you understand it better the top down or
butter up

1306
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440

 

1307
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,990

i think top down top down this is butter

1308
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,000
i think top down top down this is butter
 

1309
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,950
i think top down top down this is butter
all right

1310
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
all right
 

1311
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,750
all right
this is butter up is the reverse

1312
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,760
this is butter up is the reverse
 

1313
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,430
this is butter up is the reverse
thinking but top down is the

1314
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,440
thinking but top down is the
 

1315
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,789
thinking but top down is the
straightforward thinking

1316
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:00,799
straightforward thinking
 

1317
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,789
straightforward thinking
the only key thing is remember to use
