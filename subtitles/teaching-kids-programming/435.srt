1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,480
okay so we've been talking about a

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,400
subset for like two days yeah but today

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,799
this is the last uh

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,480
of doing this subject okay so let's just

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,960
review a little bit

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,400
three numbers you need one two three

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
and then we want to

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,080
have this uh

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
success there are eight yeah

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,960
a subset yeah

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,960
empty list one

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,320
two

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,320
three one three

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,640
two three

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,440
one two three yeah

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,440
am i missing anything

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,640
one two three four five six seven

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,920
there's one thing missing let's see boy

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,840
one two three one three two three

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,480
one two three okay there's one thing one

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,760
two yeah one two missing one i'm so

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,800
small yeah yeah i know you are yeah okay

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,600
okay so let me there there are n numbers

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,559
so

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,720
the total number of subset is 2 to the

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,439
power and why is that because each

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,760
number we can pick or skip so we have

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,240
two choices for the first number we have

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,680
two choice for the second number and so

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,159
on there

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,000
they are in in times of them and numbers

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,000
so that's two to the power and

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,720
for the backtracking yes for the

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,280
backtracking we define this uh deficit

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,680
define that first search current list

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,200
and then we are looking at ice number

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,799
so when the i reaches the end we just

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,439
put this answer

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,040
current list apart append a copy to the

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,640
current list

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,200
this means the

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,960
deep copy clone okay or you can use the

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,119
copy.d copy

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,520
or and then we can do this default

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,079
search if we not pick this number we

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,320
just move to the next number or we pick

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,119
it but we have to update we have to pass

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,040
the current uh we have to update the

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,320
current cell with this number so we see

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,079
plus

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
nouns

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,200
i

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,600
and then we move to the next number as

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,840
well so let's at the beginning we do

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,520
this data search empty list and then

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
start with the first number then we can

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,000
return this answer

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,000
easy peasy easy peasy

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,200
this is backtracking and yesterday we

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
talked about

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,239
the

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,599
what we talked about the big masking

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,040
yeah we're asking what what i'm asking

64
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,720
so because

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,200
yeah yeah finally exactly because

66
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,920
they're 2 and 2 to the power n so if we

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,599
look at the numbers between 0 to 2 to

68
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,640
the power and -1

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,959
yeah for example like that

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,959
yeah 000.0001.010.011.100.101.11011

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,640
okay so this is this actually each

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,360
binary number corresponds to a mapping

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,640
so

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,480
0 means the empty list and then 1 1 1

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,360
means that we pick up all three numbers

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,760
one two three okay so let's uh to lisa

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,959
what's what's one on one what's a one or

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,720
one three

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,440
and how about how about zero one zero

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,640
um that's two we're done okay so we got

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,680
it yeah so we

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,480
so how we interpret this that would be

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,200
uh what's to know so how do we implement

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,480
this

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,040
let's review a little bit so

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,840
answer and this for

87
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,879
i

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
in range we go through this number up to

89
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,480
1

90
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,319
2 to the power of n the 1 shift 50 n

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,640
this is also okay power 2 to the power n

92
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,640
and now we go through this index for

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,040
j in

94
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,920
range

95
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,799
n okay so i have at least currently

96
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,360
which is empty so if i and one shifty

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,599
shifty j bigger than zero then

98
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,599
carbon.append

99
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,360
open uh

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,879
nums

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,519
yeah because we are checking this j

102
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,680
number if it's uh uh if that bit is

103
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,040
particular set okay and then return and

104
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,239
answer the append command

105
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
okay

106
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,479
okay we can answer

107
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,199
okay so oh uh we have this uh iteration

108
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,600
for two to the power enter and for each

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,759
iteration we have to iterate over the

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,160
index so these time contracts is all n

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,560
times two to the power of n okay

112
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
okay so today let's talk let's look at

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
other

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,400
method which is called cast taking

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,320
what's this one mean by the way

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,960
cash

117
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,490
cascading how can i

118
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,080
c a s c a d

119
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,320
[Music]

120
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,120
c a d cascading

121
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,199
cascade it probably means

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,000
you know you put it

123
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,680
yeah it means that it put these pieces

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,280
uh one by one yeah i don't know it's

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,840
just

126
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,960
i'm just guessing okay

127
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,160
okay so let's see okay look at the

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,919
beginning

129
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,520
i have empty this yeah this is one of

130
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,360
the subset for any input right so okay

131
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,680
all right right look at me this is the

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,160
important thing here answer here right

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,240
so every time i take everything inside

134
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,240
the inside the answer

135
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,800
i i take this off right

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,560
and then i put this number that one two

137
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,000
three okay

138
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,880
okay so i take this number oh yeah empty

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,720
this i can take this number

140
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,880
type this number

141
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,759
i do i i'm looking at this first number

142
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,479
okay

143
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,320
so i'm looking at this first number

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,759
i take it off okay look i take it out

145
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,479
i take it off

146
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,280
and i append to whatever in the answer

147
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,600
so now the current the current list is

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,680
empty and plus this one number that

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,880
would be one right so i now i have this

150
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,800
two right this answer will become here

151
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,680
okay

152
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,440
now what's the next number to look at

153
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,400
two right

154
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,960
okay so i take these two out okay

155
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,919
so now whatever we have two

156
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,120
here so what i want to do is i put these

157
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,199
two

158
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,080
here and make a copy so i will have

159
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,360
these i i the new subset will be two

160
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,120
and then

161
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,600
one two

162
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,880
okay make sense okay what's the next

163
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
number

164
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,240
three three okay so now i have four in

165
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:40,630
the subset right so what do we do now

166
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,759
now we just pull the three in the subset

167
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,039
[Music]

168
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,560
so that will be

169
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,560
and another one will be three

170
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,840
one three

171
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,880
two three

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,520
one two three okay you got it yes so how

173
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,240
many of them at all one two three four

174
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,360
five six seven eight yeah okay so you

175
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,440
might not be

176
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,919
clear

177
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,440
let me repeat it okay right let me

178
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,599
repeat this

179
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,280
let me do this okay

180
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,880
let me do this again

181
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,639
now look we have numbers one two three

182
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,199
one two three

183
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,360
and then i have this answer this is we

184
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,960
only found one

185
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,520
sublist

186
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,319
subset which is empty this okay

187
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,800
now okay let's take the first number out

188
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,520
yeah

189
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,360
let's take the first number out

190
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,400
okay so what i want to do with this

191
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,400
first number is i will take whatever

192
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,680
here the answer

193
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,360
yeah

194
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,919
i have this answer

195
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,000
so now i just copy this answer here yeah

196
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,720
and then i want to

197
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,360
i want to put this one

198
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,039
append to it so that will become

199
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,039
one right so we have now two

200
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,319
okay so now that next number is two

201
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,520
right

202
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,160
yeah

203
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,879
so i put that two

204
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,639
so first of all i copied these i copied

205
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,639
two things here yeah

206
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,879
completely uh

207
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,120
whatever we have here

208
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,919
now i put a two here

209
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,240
i put a put a two at the end

210
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,240
okay

211
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,039
yeah

212
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,000
the third number

213
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,840
that's the number how do we do it

214
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,280
the cell number

215
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,279
anybody

216
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,200
um three

217
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,880
first of all we copy everything well we

218
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
have here

219
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
yeah

220
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,279
and now we put a three

221
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,279
to the end

222
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,959
yeah

223
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,519
make sense

224
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,600
do you want me to repeat it again

225
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,160
okay it's quite easy yeah so that

226
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,760
becomes a subset right look we have this

227
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,880
we have this unique number one two three

228
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,160
so now look

229
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,279
at the beginning

230
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,360
empty set yeah obviously until this is a

231
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,320
sunset right look at look at this is the

232
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,200
essence

233
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,120
yeah

234
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,720
now

235
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,160
every time i take a number first of all

236
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,800
i will copy everything

237
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,680
of the subset which is here yeah

238
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,000
now i i copy one right i copy one

239
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,200
i copy one this is the reason why i copy

240
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,120
one

241
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,640
yeah

242
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
so i put a one

243
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,040
at it

244
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,480
yeah

245
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,440
right

246
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,839
now i want to look at the number two

247
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,839
so we have two so let's copy

248
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,720
so i will put a two at the end of each

249
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,720
disk okay

250
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,720
okay now three

251
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,120
first of all i have these i copied

252
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,120
everything

253
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,680
and i put a three at the end of each

254
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,160
disk

255
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,040
okay it's this surface

256
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,600
empty one two three one two one two

257
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,720
one two one two one three

258
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,880
two three

259
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,279
three one two three yeah

260
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,160
make sense okay let's say we have

261
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,680
another one four one two three four

262
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,800
okay so how do we do it we copy

263
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,959
everything

264
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,279
we copy everything yeah

265
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,519
i'm gonna copy everything here

266
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,440
this is the copy one yeah this is the

267
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,120
copy of the existing one and i put a

268
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,200
three at the end i'll put the four on

269
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,000
the end four four

270
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,800
four

271
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
four

272
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
four

273
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,160
four four

274
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,519
four okay so look this is the process of

275
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,600
cascading

276
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,399
i take it whatever

277
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,680
and i open the new element make sense so

278
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,880
every time the subset doubles

279
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,880
yeah at the beginning is one

280
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,120
yeah and the second one

281
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,440
the second iteration two

282
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,320
and then i make two copies

283
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,320
four

284
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,200
eight sixteen

285
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,200
yeah it corresponds to this okay

286
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
yeah

287
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,160
okay let's implement this this should be

288
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,640
very very easy to implement

289
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,079
cascading

290
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,560
define

291
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,600
subset

292
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,320
numbers

293
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,880
these are unique numbers yes answer

294
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,839
at the beginning it's an empty list yeah

295
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,160
right

296
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,240
so i i just have to go to each number

297
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,320
for i in

298
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,560
nums

299
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,800
so we can do this right

300
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,920
so what do we do answer

301
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,279
plus equal we want plus equal

302
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,959
uh

303
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,000
what

304
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,760
c

305
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,200
plus

306
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,720
i

307
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,680
for

308
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,000
c

309
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
in

310
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,880
uh

311
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,600
for c

312
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,000
in answer yeah okay

313
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,880
okay so look i take whatever in the

314
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,200
color answer i append numbers back to it

315
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,680
and i append to this answer and that's

316
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,680
what exactly what i demonstrate before

317
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,560
right then return answer

318
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,720
yeah make sense look here here this is a

319
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,200
bit tricky okay c

320
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,200
let's c

321
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,279
see here this is

322
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,279
uh this is

323
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,120
okay look this is c

324
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:29,440
c is defined here for c in answers for c

325
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,440
and then i take i take everything in the

326
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,440
answer current answer

327
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,800
i append

328
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,040
the current numbers i to it and then

329
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,440
this is a set this is a list and i'll

330
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,600
turn this list back to the answer okay

331
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,560
so every time the size of the answer

332
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
doubles

333
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,800
right every time the size of the answer

334
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,839
does at the beginning is empty this okay

335
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,839
that's it for today good job bye bye
