1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
yo

2
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,120
hello mr mr ryan are you right

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,120
okay so let's talk about this the

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,240
longest increasing path okay we're given

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,719
this map of integer matrix and

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,960
we want to find out the longest strictly

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,160
strictly increasing strictly increasing

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,480
pass in metric so a path we can follow

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,920
the numbers horizontally or vertically

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,680
yeah there are two directions actually

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,240
there are four directions we can go up

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,279
down left right so

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,599
can you tell me that which

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,399
which one is the longest pass in in this

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,920
case everyone zero one three five six

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,040
nine okay

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,160
zero one three five six nine okay

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,520
anymore

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,000
yeah

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,420
zero

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,420
[Music]

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,520
okay so both the those are the longest

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,879
equally longest strictly increasing type

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,960
has six numbers yet okay

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,520
so this is the problem uh when we are

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,879
solving this today so any idea any idea

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,600
i mean you can say profess if you won't

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,680
yeah

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,320
how do we do first okay so my next

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,479
question how do we perform ryan

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,479
we check every single one

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,080
we check every single one we check every

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,799
single picture okay

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,159
so let's define it might take a long

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,880
time yeah let's define frc

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,439
is the representing the longest

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,640
longest path starting

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,880
starting at pixar rc the coordinate okay

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,119
so this actually returns an integer

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,280
telling the length the length of the the

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,680
length the length of the longest yeah

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,799
that's the longest

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,399
so then

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,640
then we can go through these possible

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,040
starting position and we

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,520
and calculate the maximum of it right

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,000
answer at the beginning so what's the

48
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,840
minimum what's the minimum length of the

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,840
longest path what's the minimum

50
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,799
[Music]

51
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,119
one exactly yeah yeah exactly each

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,040
number is each you can start with any

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,000
position and that gives us the longest

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,920
path

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
you know at least one right so answer

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,440
equals one and then four

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,040
r in rows with rows is the number of

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,319
rows in the metric

59
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,560
four c in current

60
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,520
the columns how many columns right so

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,480
answer equals maximum of answer does it

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,800
have to be three by three

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,040
no rows and columns then this is just a

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,040
very simple example okay

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,840
very good question okay by the way i

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,680
thought it was next answer

67
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,440
frc and then return answer yeah so the

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,720
the key thing here is

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,040
this an f something right something f

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,760
function so we start with this pixel and

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,840
we want to find out the num the long the

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,360
length of the longest path starting at

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
this position right

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,800
so

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
so this is it uh

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,599
so how we implement this rc function so

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,519
if we can

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,440
if we need to find out that we need to

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,280
find out if the neighboring pixel full

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,720
direction if it is strictly bigger than

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
the current pixel

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,200
right

83
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,000
then we can work right so so for example

84
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
look

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,480
okay so here look if frc is here look

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,000
it's f4 right and i'm realizing that 6

87
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,120
is bigger than 4

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,640
so f

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,560
this is what 0 1 0 1 f 1 1

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,200
will be equal to what mac 1 plus

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,840
1 plus f

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,599
if this is what coordinate will be there

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,480
that would be one two right right you

94
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,840
see

95
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,799
that

96
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,799
i'm right

97
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,879
because if i starting at this position i

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,280
can add one more pixel and the maxi one

99
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,760
plus you get it yeah

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,080
yeah yeah okay so do you

101
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,879
so so we we can just walk check four

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,480
direction and to to implement this to

103
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,400
increment this one

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,239
yeah if less restricted

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,599
if the next neighboring the four

106
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,200
direction the pixel number four

107
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,720
direction is bigger

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,239
it's bigger one of them is bigger than

109
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,280
we can just extend it one more bit okay

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,879
and then

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,959
obviously we need to

112
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,560
do one more thing one more magical

113
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,040
keyword to make it

114
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,040
efficient cash if exactly why is that if

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,600
we don't don't do that cash what will

116
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,000
happen everywhere

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,160
exponential how look if we starting from

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
this point yeah yeah

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,840
i know we somehow

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
somehow we need to calculate that

121
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,280
function from this point after the

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
function from this point f function from

123
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,160
this one

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,759
yeah and then we come back to these

125
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,240
functions and this pixel again and we

126
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,479
need to call this function again so but

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,400
we are obviously we have calculated this

128
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,400
pixel before

129
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,320
then we don't need to calculate again so

130
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,360
that that's the beauty of bringing in

131
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,080
the cash right yeah

132
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,800
i answer equals one right

133
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,800
so for the four directions yeah dr

134
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,639
minus one zero zero minus one yeah

135
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,400
that's the

136
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,880
that's the offset in the fourth

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,479
direction all right then what uh the

138
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,360
current

139
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,280
let's

140
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,199
define this f function uh c right and

141
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,919
then we put a cache here okay i'm going

142
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,759
to

143
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,680
i'm going to

144
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,479
mark it as

145
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,240
red so this is very important because if

146
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,720
we don't put this cash

147
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,400
this solution will be invisible it means

148
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,360
that impractical to to uh to solve in a

149
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
few

150
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,360
in a short amount of time right

151
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,440
okay so cash answer and then look

152
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,720
new new row equals r plus dr

153
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,680
news this column equals c plus dc then

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,520
we need to check if the is still in the

155
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,479
metric it's zero

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,720
bigger smaller than nr smaller than rows

157
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,800
rows is the number of columns number of

158
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,759
zeros yes and then

159
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,400
zero smaller equal nc is more than

160
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,919
columns if it's in with responsory

161
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,319
and also the metric

162
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:17,039
look matrix rc

163
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,039
is strictly smaller than metric

164
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,880
n r and c right this is the new

165
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,319
neighboring pixel and i see then one

166
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,600
plus

167
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,720
f

168
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,759
and r

169
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,000
and c return answer so what about this

170
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,880
cache yeah frc is the

171
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,600
last is the representing the length of

172
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,199
the longest path longest increasing

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,039
strictly increasing power starting with

174
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,840
this position rc

175
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,479
yeah the minimum is one if if the

176
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,120
neighbors if the neighbors are all

177
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,120
smaller or easier than the current pixel

178
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,199
then you'll be one right

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,759
drdc can you explain to me what it is

180
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,720
what's this for four vectors four

181
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,280
coordinates look what's this one zero

182
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,639
zero one minus one zero zero minus one

183
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,639
what's this representing

184
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,840
the four directions

185
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,560
this is one is

186
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,560
one zero one zero means down

187
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,720
zero one means right

188
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,720
minus one zero means left and what's

189
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,280
zero minus one

190
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,680
yeah zero minus one is up okay at least

191
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,599
it's the new coordinate and now you have

192
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
to check if it's in the boundary yeah

193
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,160
because it doesn't make sense if the the

194
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,680
new coordinate is beyond the boundary

195
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,000
right and then we have to check this

196
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,280
what's this what does this mean

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,800
yeah if metric rc is smaller than metric

198
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,120
n r and c

199
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,080
when do you understand this metric rc if

200
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,520
it's smaller than metric and not in c i

201
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,879
metric rc what's a 9 and c

202
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,080
what are we doing with these the four

203
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,759
directions

204
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,199
and r and c was

205
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,520
yeah and nic is the next cell okay so

206
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,879
metric rc is smaller than metric ni and

207
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,840
see what does it mean can you tell me

208
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,639
what's this represent me

209
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,800
uh so so if

210
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,720
so if

211
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:15,389
um

212
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,389
[Music]

213
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,120
yeah we can go to it we're done look we

214
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,000
can go to it how can we do it we can go

215
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,319
to it we one more yeah because if we put

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,879
one more which is the current pixel

217
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,680
right it makes the longest

218
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,479
pass one more number right and that's

219
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
the

220
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,000
that's the f and rnc is the longest part

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,719
starting with the next one next one

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,880
right

223
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,039
yeah and then if we put the current

224
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,399
pixel that will become one more right

225
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
you get it

226
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,360
yeah

227
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,560
so if we put the cash

228
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,800
then that means if if we put a cash then

229
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,720
it means what if it means that we the

230
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,440
maximum stay number of state we're

231
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,680
calculating is r times c

232
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,000
okay this is the number of states we

233
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,800
these are calculating then we iterate

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,040
over each pixel and we try to calculate

235
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,360
the length length of longest path

236
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,800
starting with legs what's the tango next

237
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,279
so

238
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,040
maybe not for r in

239
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,800
row yeah

240
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,440
for c in columns

241
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,320
and answer and the outside answer equals

242
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,080
one answer equals max

243
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,800
answer

244
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,120
f r c y and rc

245
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,760
here right so this is o r times c but

246
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,880
for each one we we can we calculate only

247
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,399
once

248
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,240
right so

249
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,480
so if the time connection is oh i see

250
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,240
okay oh i see

251
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
let's call talk down that let me program

252
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,320
here

253
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,040
yeah we need if we don't put a cache

254
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,000
that'll be exponential because for each

255
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,800
know maybe

256
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,480
maybe duplicate the

257
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,920
you know values we need to calculate

258
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,920
again again okay that's it for today bye
