00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,040

 

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,350

that's okay today we talk about the

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
that's okay today we talk about the
 

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,950
that's okay today we talk about the
sorting link list yeah

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
sorting link list yeah
 

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,510
sorting link list yeah
sourcing link list do you still remember

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
sourcing link list do you still remember
 

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,349
sourcing link list do you still remember
what's linked list

10
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
what's linked list
 

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,630
what's linked list
yeah i talked about that all the time

12
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
yeah i talked about that all the time
 

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,069
yeah i talked about that all the time
sought a link list

14
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079

 

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,709

look at this this is linked is that yeah

16
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
look at this this is linked is that yeah
 

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,229
look at this this is linked is that yeah
why are we doing about link

18
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239
why are we doing about link
 

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,950
why are we doing about link
because it's fine why don't we talk

20
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
because it's fine why don't we talk
 

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,150
because it's fine why don't we talk
about something else

22
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
about something else
 

23
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,229
about something else
we'll talk about something else next

24
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
we'll talk about something else next
 

25
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,150
we'll talk about something else next
next time okay so look at the link this

26
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
next time okay so look at the link this
 

27
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,670
next time okay so look at the link this
you're given this head all right

28
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
you're given this head all right
 

29
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,790
you're given this head all right
yes do you still remember that uh a few

30
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
yes do you still remember that uh a few
 

31
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,029
yes do you still remember that uh a few
weeks ago we talked about munch salt

32
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
weeks ago we talked about munch salt
 

33
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,350
weeks ago we talked about munch salt
yes yes yeah yeah we're given a list

34
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:56,360

 

35
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,590

[Music]

36
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
[Music]
 

37
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,750
[Music]
look this is a list the the difference

38
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
look this is a list the the difference
 

39
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,630
look this is a list the the difference
between the

40
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
between the
 

41
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,869
between the
link list and the list is that in the

42
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
link list and the list is that in the
 

43
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,789
link list and the list is that in the
link list you usually given the

44
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799
link list you usually given the
 

45
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,510
link list you usually given the
hat which you can only travel followed

46
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
hat which you can only travel followed
 

47
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,109
hat which you can only travel followed
by head to the end right

48
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
by head to the end right
 

49
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,390
by head to the end right
but for the list you can

50
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
but for the list you can
 

51
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,749
but for the list you can
have you can it's because it's stored

52
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
have you can it's because it's stored
 

53
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,910
have you can it's because it's stored
continuously in memory so it's a piece

54
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
continuously in memory so it's a piece
 

55
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,149
continuously in memory so it's a piece
of continuous memory so you can

56
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
of continuous memory so you can
 

57
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,109
of continuous memory so you can
you can have this random access you can

58
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
you can have this random access you can
 

59
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:23,429
you can have this random access you can
take

60
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
take
 

61
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,749
take
okay i wanted a third element then i can

62
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
okay i wanted a third element then i can
 

63
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,870
okay i wanted a third element then i can
retrieve it

64
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
retrieve it
 

65
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,710
retrieve it
but if you want to retrieve the third

66
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
but if you want to retrieve the third
 

67
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,230
but if you want to retrieve the third
element of the linked list

68
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
element of the linked list
 

69
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,310
element of the linked list
you need to oh and it needs to take over

70
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
you need to oh and it needs to take over
 

71
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,670
you need to oh and it needs to take over
in time right because it

72
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
in time right because it
 

73
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,230
in time right because it
needs to follow from the beginning right

74
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
needs to follow from the beginning right
 

75
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,749
needs to follow from the beginning right
but the principle to sort

76
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
but the principle to sort
 

77
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,510
but the principle to sort
the linked list and then to sort uh

78
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
the linked list and then to sort uh
 

79
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,389
the linked list and then to sort uh
uh a list is quite similar for a link

80
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
uh a list is quite similar for a link
 

81
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,030
uh a list is quite similar for a link
for us

82
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
for us
 

83
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,429
for us
for sorting a list we can do the merge

84
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
for sorting a list we can do the merge
 

85
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,109
for sorting a list we can do the merge
store remember the merge store

86
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
store remember the merge store
 

87
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,190
store remember the merge store
so what do we do about the magisto we

88
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
so what do we do about the magisto we
 

89
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,310
so what do we do about the magisto we
imagine

90
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
imagine
 

91
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,870
imagine
we cut into half right yeah we cut into

92
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
we cut into half right yeah we cut into
 

93
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,149
we cut into half right yeah we cut into
half and then we

94
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
half and then we
 

95
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,069
half and then we
saw these two and then we merged it

96
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
saw these two and then we merged it
 

97
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,429
saw these two and then we merged it
together right

98
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
together right
 

99
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,149
together right
so here it's the same so how do we cut

100
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
so here it's the same so how do we cut
 

101
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,870
so here it's the same so how do we cut
it into half

102
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
it into half
 

103
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,429
it into half
why don't we learn how to measure link

104
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
why don't we learn how to measure link
 

105
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:13,630
why don't we learn how to measure link
how do we charge it for do number we

106
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:13,640

 

107
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,990

[Music]

108
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
[Music]
 

109
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,390
[Music]
so we know the middle yeah so we can cut

110
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
so we know the middle yeah so we can cut
 

111
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,110
so we know the middle yeah so we can cut
in half

112
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
in half
 

113
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,030
in half
yeah and then we can sort these two link

114
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
yeah and then we can sort these two link
 

115
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,670
yeah and then we can sort these two link
list yeah once the tool increase is

116
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
list yeah once the tool increase is
 

117
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,790
list yeah once the tool increase is
sorted

118
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
sorted
 

119
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,150
sorted
then what happens we can merge it yeah

120
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
then what happens we can merge it yeah
 

121
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,470
then what happens we can merge it yeah
remember we also talked about how too

122
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
remember we also talked about how too
 

123
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,190
remember we also talked about how too
much to

124
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
much to
 

125
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,550
much to
sort this right

126
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560

 

127
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,910

like a list and another list so we have

128
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
like a list and another list so we have
 

129
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,350
like a list and another list so we have
a point if these both are

130
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
a point if these both are
 

131
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,270
a point if these both are
sorted we have pointers and then we

132
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
sorted we have pointers and then we
 

133
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,790
sorted we have pointers and then we
compare the elements of these two

134
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
compare the elements of these two
 

135
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,830
compare the elements of these two
pointers

136
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
pointers
 

137
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,589
pointers
and then we move forward each time right

138
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
and then we move forward each time right
 

139
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,949
and then we move forward each time right
remember yes yeah

140
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
remember yes yeah
 

141
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,990
remember yes yeah
so the complexity either one no

142
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
so the complexity either one no
 

143
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,750
so the complexity either one no
i won again i won is there one

144
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
i won again i won is there one
 

145
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,790
i won again i won is there one
no of course no no again yeah oh and

146
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
no of course no no again yeah oh and
 

147
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,509
no of course no no again yeah oh and
logan

148
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
logan
 

149
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,110
logan
don't make a guess oh one is i it's very

150
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
don't make a guess oh one is i it's very
 

151
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,710
don't make a guess oh one is i it's very
rare i mean you do you get it

152
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
rare i mean you do you get it
 

153
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,670
rare i mean you do you get it
over means constant means that your

154
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
over means constant means that your
 

155
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,589
over means constant means that your
complexity your writing time does not

156
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
complexity your writing time does not
 

157
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,790
complexity your writing time does not
change if your

158
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
change if your
 

159
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,750
change if your
linked list is grow as much as possible

160
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
linked list is grow as much as possible
 

161
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,470
linked list is grow as much as possible
right

162
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
right
 

163
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,030
right
but for this one we cut into half and

164
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
but for this one we cut into half and
 

165
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,070
but for this one we cut into half and
then we smudge it

166
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
then we smudge it
 

167
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,350
then we smudge it
right yeah cut into half is on

168
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
right yeah cut into half is on
 

169
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,190
right yeah cut into half is on
right and then

170
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
right and then
 

171
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,710
right and then
divide and conquer and then salt it

172
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
divide and conquer and then salt it
 

173
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,910
divide and conquer and then salt it
so we actually we divide and then we

174
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
so we actually we divide and then we
 

175
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,789
so we actually we divide and then we
need to

176
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
need to
 

177
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,270
need to
we divide it every time log divided by

178
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
we divide it every time log divided by
 

179
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,229
we divide it every time log divided by
half is log n

180
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
half is log n
 

181
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,110
half is log n
so all together is over and again okay

182
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
so all together is over and again okay
 

183
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,509
so all together is over and again okay
yes

184
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
yes
 

185
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,270
yes
yeah okay so so i'm i'm not going to

186
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
yeah okay so so i'm i'm not going to
 

187
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,750
yeah okay so so i'm i'm not going to
write

188
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
write
 

189
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,110
write
the detail for finding the uh

190
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
the detail for finding the uh
 

191
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,110
the detail for finding the uh
the only only one difference is finding

192
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
the only only one difference is finding
 

193
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,149
the only only one difference is finding
the middle yeah

194
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
the middle yeah
 

195
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,070
the middle yeah
previously you want to find the meter

196
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
previously you want to find the meter
 

197
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,429
previously you want to find the meter
right you have

198
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
right you have
 

199
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,710
right you have
uh you have to

200
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
uh you have to
 

201
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,229
uh you have to
um you have two pointers yes one

202
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
um you have two pointers yes one
 

203
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,149
um you have two pointers yes one
walk twice as fast as the other one

204
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
walk twice as fast as the other one
 

205
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,550
walk twice as fast as the other one
right like that

206
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
right like that
 

207
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,350
right like that
okay then here and then and then here

208
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
okay then here and then and then here
 

209
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,070
okay then here and then and then here
yeah

210
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
yeah
 

211
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,229
yeah
but when you when this is slow it's the

212
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
but when you when this is slow it's the
 

213
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,110
but when you when this is slow it's the
middle

214
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
middle
 

215
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,470
middle
so now we actually need to disconnect it

216
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
so now we actually need to disconnect it
 

217
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,110
so now we actually need to disconnect it
right do you understand we actually need

218
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
right do you understand we actually need
 

219
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,390
right do you understand we actually need
to disconnect it

220
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
to disconnect it
 

221
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,509
to disconnect it
so what we will do is we return

222
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
so what we will do is we return
 

223
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,350
so what we will do is we return
slow dot next we return this node

224
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
slow dot next we return this node
 

225
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,510
slow dot next we return this node
but we also no dot next equals num so we

226
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
but we also no dot next equals num so we
 

227
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,870
but we also no dot next equals num so we
disconnect it

228
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
disconnect it
 

229
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,070
disconnect it
so we it becomes two linked list

230
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
so we it becomes two linked list
 

231
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,030
so we it becomes two linked list
yes now once we have little increase

232
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
yes now once we have little increase
 

233
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,230
yes now once we have little increase
then we can

234
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
then we can
 

235
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,950
then we can
sort it until we i know we merge it okay

236
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
sort it until we i know we merge it okay
 

237
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,670
sort it until we i know we merge it okay
so

238
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
so
 

239
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,870
so
what i'll do is here define

240
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
what i'll do is here define
 

241
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,749
what i'll do is here define
thought sort of increase yeah which

242
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
thought sort of increase yeah which
 

243
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,270
thought sort of increase yeah which
given the

244
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
given the
 

245
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,990
given the
head okay so now

246
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
head okay so now
 

247
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,110
head okay so now
look so all we do if

248
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
look so all we do if
 

249
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,029
look so all we do if
head is null

250
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
head is null
 

251
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,469
head is null
or head dot next

252
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
or head dot next
 

253
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,110
or head dot next
is now return what

254
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120

 

255
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,990

because if it's a head it's not nothing

256
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
because if it's a head it's not nothing
 

257
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,310
because if it's a head it's not nothing
or

258
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
or
 

259
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,310
or
it's a single note we just written it

260
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
it's a single note we just written it
 

261
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,230
it's a single note we just written it
there okay

262
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
there okay
 

263
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,830
there okay
then we have a note now we need to get

264
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
then we have a note now we need to get
 

265
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,390
then we have a note now we need to get
the middle of the one right so now we

266
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
the middle of the one right so now we
 

267
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,550
the middle of the one right so now we
what we do we got to meet equals

268
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
what we do we got to meet equals
 

269
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,350
what we do we got to meet equals
uh let's say get mean okay let's have a

270
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
uh let's say get mean okay let's have a
 

271
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,670
uh let's say get mean okay let's have a
function can meet

272
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
function can meet
 

273
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,110
function can meet
head but this function does not simply

274
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
head but this function does not simply
 

275
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,950
head but this function does not simply
return the middle of it it also

276
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
return the middle of it it also
 

277
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,150
return the middle of it it also
disconnect it

278
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
disconnect it
 

279
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,629
disconnect it
right yeah we need to make sure of that

280
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
right yeah we need to make sure of that
 

281
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,189
right yeah we need to make sure of that
and then

282
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
and then
 

283
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,670
and then
we have a meat we have had now what we

284
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
we have a meat we have had now what we
 

285
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,629
we have a meat we have had now what we
do

286
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
do
 

287
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,230
do
we we said meat equals salt

288
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
we we said meat equals salt
 

289
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,350
we we said meat equals salt
meat right

290
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
meat right
 

291
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,350
meat right
so we're calling this recursively

292
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
so we're calling this recursively
 

293
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,950
so we're calling this recursively
sorting the meet

294
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
sorting the meet
 

295
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,670
sorting the meet
the link another link list the half of

296
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
the link another link list the half of
 

297
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,469
the link another link list the half of
linked list

298
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
linked list
 

299
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,150
linked list
and now we also call the first

300
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
and now we also call the first
 

301
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,670
and now we also call the first
uh pet okay let's call it head it's we

302
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
uh pet okay let's call it head it's we
 

303
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,070
uh pet okay let's call it head it's we
had equal assault head

304
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
had equal assault head
 

305
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,950
had equal assault head
okay so now the head and meat are two

306
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
okay so now the head and meat are two
 

307
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,390
okay so now the head and meat are two
salted least right

308
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
salted least right
 

309
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:25,390
salted least right
then what we do return

310
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,400

 

311
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:32,830

[Music]

315
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,629

yeah yes does that make sense doesn't

316
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
yeah yes does that make sense doesn't
 

317
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,710
yeah yes does that make sense doesn't
make sense yes does it make sense

319
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,430

yes look that's it makes sense okay tell

320
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
yes look that's it makes sense okay tell
 

321
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,309
yes look that's it makes sense okay tell
me next

322

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,110
okay so now uh any question before we
move on to coding

326

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,990
issues with the
formatting but let's try let's try

528
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
formatting but let's try let's try
 

529
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,829
formatting but let's try let's try
just to type it again and remove all of

530
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839
just to type it again and remove all of
 

531
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:54,550
just to type it again and remove all of
it

532
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560

 

533
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,030

and now we can remove 10 to 15 times

534
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040

 

535
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,629

what

536
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639

 

537
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,389

uh

538
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399

 

539
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,230

but the first one is the ah all turns

540
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
but the first one is the ah all turns
 

541
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,829
but the first one is the ah all turns
white yeah yeah it's very strange

542
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
white yeah yeah it's very strange
 

543
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,470
white yeah yeah it's very strange
why why is that

544
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480

 

545
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,269

it's kind of very strange to find

546
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
it's kind of very strange to find
 

547
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:43,269
it's kind of very strange to find
itself

548
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279

 

549
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,870

so the next note equals 19

550
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
so the next note equals 19
 

551
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,790
so the next note equals 19
and then 5 to 8 i remove it

552
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
and then 5 to 8 i remove it
 

553
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,990
and then 5 to 8 i remove it
wait i i i spotted some arrows there's

554
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
wait i i i spotted some arrows there's
 

555
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,150
wait i i i spotted some arrows there's

you see
 

577
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,189
you see
yeah now let's do the coding

578
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
yeah now let's do the coding
 

579
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,269
yeah now let's do the coding
so in order to do this uh we can do this

580
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
so in order to do this uh we can do this

591
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,310

okay let's see me let's do it first

592
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
okay let's see me let's do it first
 

593
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,269
okay let's see me let's do it first
which is the

594
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279
which is the
 

595
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,949
which is the
called uh actually we

called uh actually we
 

597
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,629
called uh actually we
actually we can divide it here look um

598
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639
actually we can divide it here look um
 

599
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,509
actually we can divide it here look um
define this in ethno and then we can

600
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:13,519
define this in ethno and then we can
 

601
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,629
define this in ethno and then we can
also

602
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
also
 

603
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,829
also
say we can define it here define

604
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839

 

605
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,430

what uh actually let's write it outside

606
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
what uh actually let's write it outside
 

607
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,870
what uh actually let's write it outside
okay which is clear

608
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
okay which is clear
 

609
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,470
okay which is clear
much more clear okay we don't want to

610
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
much more clear okay we don't want to
 

611
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,550
much more clear okay we don't want to
mess with the cast let's see

612
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
mess with the cast let's see
 

613
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,670
mess with the cast let's see
uh define merge a

614
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
uh define merge a
 

615
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,069
uh define merge a
and b to link list do you still remember

616
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
and b to link list do you still remember
 

617
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,990
and b to link list do you still remember
how to do this

618
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
how to do this
 

619
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,749
how to do this
we do a strumming head

620
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759

okay and then he will stop me
 

625
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,509
okay and then he will stop me
y a and b

626
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
y a and b
 

627
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,269
y a and b
you can tell me what to do with this one

628
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
you can tell me what to do with this one
 

629
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,790
you can tell me what to do with this one
if a

630
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
if a
 

631
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,350
if a
the value is smaller than b of value so

632
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
the value is smaller than b of value so
 

633
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,470
the value is smaller than b of value so
what to do

634
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:58,480
what to do
 

635
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,949
what to do
we need to use the value a right yeah

636
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
we need to use the value a right yeah
 

637
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,630
we need to use the value a right yeah
another x a equals eight or next no

638
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,640
another x a equals eight or next no
 

639
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,309
another x a equals eight or next no
okay am i right you still remember

640
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
okay am i right you still remember
 

641
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,750
okay am i right you still remember
how to merge it and s

642
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
how to merge it and s
 

643
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,110
how to merge it and s
p the next note will be the b right

644
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
p the next note will be the b right
 

645
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,230
p the next note will be the b right
b will be equals next note alright

646
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
b will be equals next note alright
 

647
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,110
b will be equals next note alright
and then p equals p to the next note

648
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
and then p equals p to the next note
 

649
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,069
and then p equals p to the next note
move to the next

650
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
move to the next
 

651
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,110
move to the next
and then if a is still left

652
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
and then if a is still left
 

653
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,190
and then if a is still left
we can do it next note would be a if b

654
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
we can do it next note would be a if b
 

655
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,230
we can do it next note would be a if b
p p dot next no

656
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
p p dot next no
 

657
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,789
p p dot next no
equals p and then return what

658
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
equals p and then return what
 

659
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,190
equals p and then return what
dummy the next right okay this is to

660
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
dummy the next right okay this is to
 

661
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,230
dummy the next right okay this is to
tell me because we are not using it yeah

662
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
tell me because we are not using it yeah
 

663
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,750
tell me because we are not using it yeah
do you get it we're not using it we're

664
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
do you get it we're not using it we're
 

665
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,350
do you get it we're not using it we're
just using dummy the next now

666
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
just using dummy the next now
 

667
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,029
just using dummy the next now

if a head is numb our head the next is

678
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
if a head is numb our head the next is
 

679
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,270
if a head is numb our head the next is
numb

680
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
numb
 

681
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,110
numb
yeah if it's just a single note or

682
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,120
yeah if it's just a single note or
 

683
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,710
yeah if it's just a single note or
nothing we just return ahead okay

684
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
nothing we just return ahead okay
 

685
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,830
nothing we just return ahead okay
fast slow equals head head right

686
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
fast slow equals head head right
 

687
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,510
fast slow equals head head right
why fast and fast the next note

688
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
why fast and fast the next note
 

689
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,430
why fast and fast the next note
then fast equals what

690
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440

 

691
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,950

the next note stop next now

692
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
the next note stop next now
 

693
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,710
the next note stop next now
and then slow slow slow

694
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720

 

695
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,029

that's it because slow slow node will

696
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
that's it because slow slow node will
 

697
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,510
that's it because slow slow node will
only work once one step at a time

698
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
only work once one step at a time
 

699
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,070
only work once one step at a time
and then return slow right but before

700
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
and then return slow right but before
 

701
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,669
and then return slow right but before
that we need to

702
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
that we need to
 

703
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,230
that we need to
let's call it break meat because we're

704
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
let's call it break meat because we're
 

705
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,190
let's call it break meat because we're
going to break it

706
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,200
going to break it
 

707
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,830
going to break it
into break at the middle part yeah so we

708
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
into break at the middle part yeah so we
 

709
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,710
into break at the middle part yeah so we
need to recall the previous note

710
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
need to recall the previous note
 

711
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,029
need to recall the previous note
previous note before let's do note so we

712
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
previous note before let's do note so we
 

713
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:55,750
previous note before let's do note so we
call it pre

714
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
call it pre
 

715
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,510
call it pre
equals nine yeah and then before we

716
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
equals nine yeah and then before we
 

717
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,190
equals nine yeah and then before we
change it to slow equals no

718
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
change it to slow equals no
 

719
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,390
change it to slow equals no
dot next note we do this

720
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
dot next note we do this
 

721
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,110
dot next note we do this
previous equals low right yeah so

722
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
previous equals low right yeah so
 

723
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,510
previous equals low right yeah so
preview is the slow

724
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
preview is the slow
 

725
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,070
preview is the slow
source previous note and then previous

726
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
source previous note and then previous
 

727
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,830
source previous note and then previous
note down next

728
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
note down next
 

729
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,549
note down next
what would be next note will be let's

730
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
what would be next note will be let's
 

731
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,270
what would be next note will be let's
break it yeah

732
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
break it yeah
 

733
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,590
break it yeah
now right now we'll change though am

734
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
now right now we'll change though am
 

735
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,789
now right now we'll change though am
right

736
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
right
 

737
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,669
right
okay now how to we have a break and we

738
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:21,679
okay now how to we have a break and we
 

739
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,549
okay now how to we have a break and we
have a merge

740
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559
have a merge
 

741
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,070
have a merge
and then like let's saute it sauce

742
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
and then like let's saute it sauce
 

743
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,590
and then like let's saute it sauce
head it had his mouth

744
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
head it had his mouth
 

745
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,830
head it had his mouth
or her legs no it's now

746
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
or her legs no it's now
 

747
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,150
or her legs no it's now
three times

748
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
three times
 

749
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,510
three times
meat equals break meat breaking meat

750
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520
meat equals break meat breaking meat
 

751
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,510
meat equals break meat breaking meat
land we break a meal yeah now we have

752
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
land we break a meal yeah now we have
 

753
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,270
land we break a meal yeah now we have
release then head

754
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
release then head
 

755
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,590
release then head
head will become salt

756
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600

 

757
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,150

wait wait wait we need to solder solid

758
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
wait wait wait we need to solder solid
 

759
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,750
wait wait wait we need to solder solid
speed as well right

760
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
speed as well right
 

761
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:02,470
speed as well right
yes all right and then we can return

762
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480

 

763
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,270

it so the complexities then we can do

764
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
it so the complexities then we can do
 

765
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,070
it so the complexities then we can do
this

766
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080

 

767
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,909

equals soft head right

768
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
equals soft head right
 

769
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,310
equals soft head right
and then oh i i think i i think

770
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
and then oh i i think i i think
 

771
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,510
and then oh i i think i i think
here okay let's let's see if it works

772
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:19,520
here okay let's let's see if it works
 

773
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,350
here okay let's let's see if it works
okay

774
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
okay
 

775
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,830
okay
oh look it's sauteed yeah you see it's

776
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
oh look it's sauteed yeah you see it's
 

777
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,630
oh look it's sauteed yeah you see it's
salty

778
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,640
salty
 

779
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,510
salty
got it yeah this is all here

780
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520

 

781
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,350

does it make sense so we actually just

782
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
does it make sense so we actually just
 

783
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,390
does it make sense so we actually just
need you you you already learn how to

784
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
need you you you already learn how to
 

785
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,310
need you you you already learn how to
merge two soft deletes yeah this is

786
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
merge two soft deletes yeah this is
 

787
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,950
merge two soft deletes yeah this is
you previously know how to do it right

788
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:41,960
you previously know how to do it right
 

789
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,990
you previously know how to do it right
[Music]

790
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,000
[Music]
 

791
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,190
[Music]
and okay and then you also need know how

792
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
and okay and then you also need know how
 

793
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,230
and okay and then you also need know how
to break

794
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
to break
 

795
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,630
to break
get the middle right the only new thing

796
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
get the middle right the only new thing
 

797
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,149
get the middle right the only new thing
here is we have at least previous

798
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
here is we have at least previous
 

799
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:52,710
here is we have at least previous
pointer

800
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
pointer
 

801
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,590
pointer
so previous is always once no before

802
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
so previous is always once no before
 

803
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,110
so previous is always once no before
let's know right

804
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120

 

805
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,470

look at 953 look line 53

806
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
look at 953 look line 53
 

807
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,390
look at 953 look line 53
previous no the next note equals now

808
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
previous no the next note equals now
 

809
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,750
previous no the next note equals now
what does it do here eric

810
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
what does it do here eric
 

811
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,350
what does it do here eric
previously

812
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:11,360

 

813
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,029

yeah what does it do here

814
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:17,039
yeah what does it do here
 

815
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,870
yeah what does it do here
so you find the middle of the blinker is

816
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
so you find the middle of the blinker is
 

817
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,230
so you find the middle of the blinker is
what does it do

818
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
what does it do
 

819
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,070
what does it do
the slow is the middle of linked list

820
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,080
the slow is the middle of linked list
 

821
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,990
the slow is the middle of linked list
the previous note is the slowest

822
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
the previous note is the slowest
 

823
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,470
the previous note is the slowest
previous note so previous stop next note

824
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
previous note so previous stop next note
 

825
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,909
previous note so previous stop next note
equals now what does it do here

826
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919

 

827
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,790

so 953 what does it mean

828
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:34,800
so 953 what does it mean
 

829
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,510
so 953 what does it mean
[Music]

830
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520
[Music]
 

831
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,669
[Music]
yeah what are we trying to do here

832
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679

 

833
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,230

what's the function name called line 44

834
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,240

 

835
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,350

yeah what does it do

836
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
yeah what does it do
 

837
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,909
yeah what does it do
define the different way commit head

838
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
define the different way commit head
 

839
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,590
define the different way commit head
then the 9 15 44 to 54 what does it do

840
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
then the 9 15 44 to 54 what does it do
 

841
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,390
then the 9 15 44 to 54 what does it do
actually

842
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,400
actually
 

843
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,630
actually
ryan any of you is

844
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
ryan any of you is
 

845
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,230
ryan any of you is

now i added this line 9 48
 

859
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:31,029
now i added this line 9 48
9 51 and line 53 what does it do here

860
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039

 

861
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,430

we have a meter node and we have a node

862
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:33,440
we have a meter node and we have a node
 

863
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,270
we have a meter node and we have a node
before the meter node and now we are

864
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,280
before the meter node and now we are
 

865
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,470
before the meter node and now we are
setting the

866
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
setting the
 

867
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,270
setting the
previous node of the meter node dot next

868
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
previous node of the meter node dot next
 

869
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,070
previous node of the meter node dot next
note equals

870
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
note equals
 

871
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,390
note equals
noun so basically we are what

872
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,400
noun so basically we are what
 

873
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,190
noun so basically we are what
we are breaking it right we are breaking

874
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200
we are breaking it right we are breaking
 

875
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,669
we are breaking it right we are breaking
this

876
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
this
 

877
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,669
this
in the middle part right so you are

878
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
in the middle part right so you are
 

879
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,110
in the middle part right so you are
turning into two notes

880
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,120
turning into two notes
 

881
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,390
turning into two notes
two linkages am right yeah okay

882
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
two linkages am right yeah okay
 

883
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,590
two linkages am right yeah okay
so do you understand what 953

884
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,600
so do you understand what 953
 

885
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,470
so do you understand what 953
yeah and then now when we break the note

886
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
yeah and then now when we break the note
 

887
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,430
yeah and then now when we break the note
look

888
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
look
 

889
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,990
look
when we break the note here breaking the

890
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000
when we break the note here breaking the
 

891
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,549
when we break the note here breaking the
note

892
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
note
 

893
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,510
note
then we can sort it right let's analyze

894
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
then we can sort it right let's analyze
 

895
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,390
then we can sort it right let's analyze
sorted

896
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
sorted
 

897
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,390
sorted
and then we saw the first half this is

898
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
and then we saw the first half this is
 

899
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,430
and then we saw the first half this is
960.

900
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
960.
 

901
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,870
960.
we saw the second half which is 9

902
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:14,880
we saw the second half which is 9
 

903
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,350
we saw the second half which is 9
59 and then we merged two thought like

904
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
59 and then we merged two thought like
 

905
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,350
59 and then we merged two thought like
this which you already know how to do

906
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
this which you already know how to do
 

907

this which you already know how to do
that

908
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
that
 

909
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,909
that
is in here line 27 to 942 okay
