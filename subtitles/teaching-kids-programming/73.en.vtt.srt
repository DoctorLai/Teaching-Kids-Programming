and then i start i need to add one to
the last digit so

76
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
the last digit so
 

77
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,270

bracket what i put a number here
 

85
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,229
bracket what i put a number here
plus equals one so what's this number

86
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
plus equals one so what's this number
 

87
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,270
plus equals one so what's this number
last digit last

88
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
last digit last
 

89
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,990
last digit last
i'll give you a hint it's a negative

90
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
i'll give you a hint it's a negative
 

91
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,030
i'll give you a hint it's a negative
number

92
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
number
 

93
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,470
number
the last digit negative negative

94
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
the last digit negative negative
 

95
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,630
the last digit negative negative
1 1 yes negative 1 means the last digit

96
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
1 1 yes negative 1 means the last digit
 

97
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,350
1 1 yes negative 1 means the last digit
so

98
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
so
 

99
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,470
so
look it's one two three and then a minus

100
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
look it's one two three and then a minus
 

101
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,430
look it's one two three and then a minus
one is this one

102
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
one is this one
 

103
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,430
one is this one
plus equals one now it changes to four

104
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
plus equals one now it changes to four
 

105
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,869
plus equals one now it changes to four
right yeah

106
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
right yeah
 

107
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,550
right yeah
yeah and now look return

108
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
yeah and now look return
 

109
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,070
yeah and now look return
no no no let's do it minus one okay so

110
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
no no no let's do it minus one okay so
 

111
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,229
no no no let's do it minus one okay so
this this n will be pointing to this

112
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
this this n will be pointing to this
 

113
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,830
this this n will be pointing to this
okay so now

114
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840

 

115
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,070

why

116
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
why
 

117
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,270
why
and bigger than equal and zero right

118
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
and bigger than equal and zero right
 

119
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,910
and bigger than equal and zero right
i want to add it from this way right yes

120
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
i want to add it from this way right yes
 

121
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,149
i want to add it from this way right yes
then i need to do this a

122
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
then i need to do this a
 

123
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,350
then i need to do this a
and d plus equals

124
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
and d plus equals
 

125
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,070
and d plus equals
this carry i need to add the characters

126
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
this carry i need to add the characters
 

127
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,869
this carry i need to add the characters
right

128
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
right
 

129
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,710
right
and the camera which is zero first and

130
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
and the camera which is zero first and
 

131
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,190
and the camera which is zero first and
then if it's bigger than zero

132
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
then if it's bigger than zero
 

133
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,149
then if it's bigger than zero
then a and

134
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
then a and
 

135
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,630
then a and
how can i get this if this is 10 how can

136
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
how can i get this if this is 10 how can
 

137
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,589
how can i get this if this is 10 how can
i get the

138
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
i get the
 

139
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,630
i get the
rightmost digit

140
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640

 

141
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,630

right digit negative

142
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
right digit negative
 

143
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,190
right digit negative
so the a is 10 for example a is 10 and i

144
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
so the a is 10 for example a is 10 and i
 

145
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,789
so the a is 10 for example a is 10 and i
want to get this zero

146
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
want to get this zero
 

147
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,390
want to get this zero
and get this one so one equals a

148
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
and get this one so one equals a
 

149
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,589
and get this one so one equals a
divided by ten right zero equals a

150
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
divided by ten right zero equals a
 

151
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,509
divided by ten right zero equals a
what what ten times

152
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
what what ten times
 

153
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,550
what what ten times
modulus yeah divided by 10

154
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
modulus yeah divided by 10
 

155
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,910
modulus yeah divided by 10
yeah got it so now i add the 10 and then

156
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
yeah got it so now i add the 10 and then
 

157
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,470
yeah got it so now i add the 10 and then
i need to

158
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
i need to
 

159
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,509
i need to
like the same yeah yeah yeah so first of

160
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
like the same yeah yeah yeah so first of
 

161
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,110
like the same yeah yeah yeah so first of
all i need to do what i need to

162
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
all i need to do what i need to
 

163
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,630
all i need to do what i need to
get a carry because if it's bigger than

164
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
get a carry because if it's bigger than
 

165
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,390
get a carry because if it's bigger than
10 i do this okay

166
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
10 i do this okay
 

167
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,949
10 i do this okay
and then a n would be modulus equals 10

168
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
and then a n would be modulus equals 10
 

169
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:05,270
and then a n would be modulus equals 10
right

170
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
right
 

171
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,390
right
i just need one digit and if

172
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
i just need one digit and if
 

173
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,509
i just need one digit and if
c is zero if carry is zero then we don't

174
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
c is zero if carry is zero then we don't
 

175
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,030
c is zero if carry is zero then we don't
need to continue right

176
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
need to continue right
 

177
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,870
need to continue right
yes so what's the key word here

178
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
yes so what's the key word here
 

179
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,909
yes so what's the key word here
what's the key okay what's the key

180
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
what's the key okay what's the key
 

181
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,189
what's the key okay what's the key
sorry break i want to break the loop

182
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
sorry break i want to break the loop
 

183
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,830
sorry break i want to break the loop
yeah remember break is breaking the loop

184
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
yeah remember break is breaking the loop
 

185
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,390
yeah remember break is breaking the loop
continue is continue with the loop okay

186
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
continue is continue with the loop okay
 

187
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,070
continue is continue with the loop okay
and then look look and there's one edge

188
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
and then look look and there's one edge
 

189
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,030
and then look look and there's one edge
cases look

190
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
cases look
 

191
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,870
cases look
99 you add a zero that will be zero

192
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
99 you add a zero that will be zero
 

193
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,710
99 you add a zero that will be zero
zero but you need to add one the carry

194
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
zero but you need to add one the carry
 

195
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,310
zero but you need to add one the carry
is one fc is one right

196
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
is one fc is one right
 

197
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,510
is one fc is one right
you need to add before be before the a

198
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
you need to add before be before the a
 

199
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,550
you need to add before be before the a
so if c is bigger than zero a

200
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
so if c is bigger than zero a
 

201
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,950
so if c is bigger than zero a
dot insert insert put it at a zero the

202
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
dot insert insert put it at a zero the
 

203
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,150
dot insert insert put it at a zero the
beginning and then

204
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
beginning and then
 

205
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,189
beginning and then
put a c here and return a

206
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
put a c here and return a
 

207
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,830
put a c here and return a
okay that's it what's the time

208
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
okay that's it what's the time
 

209
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,790
okay that's it what's the time
complexity

210
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800

 

211
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,270

yeah n is the number of the elements

212
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
yeah n is the number of the elements
 

213
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,909
yeah n is the number of the elements
okay

214
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
okay
 

215
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,830
okay
so basically what was that what it does

216
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
so basically what was that what it does
 

217
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,270
so basically what was that what it does
i add one to the end

218
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
i add one to the end
 

219
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,029
i add one to the end
right right most of the digit and then

220
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
right right most of the digit and then
 

221
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,590
right right most of the digit and then
and i keep going this way first of all i

222
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
and i keep going this way first of all i
 

223
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,749
and i keep going this way first of all i
will add a digit i add a carry

224
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
will add a digit i add a carry
 

225
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,550
will add a digit i add a carry
and then i will get a new carry new

226
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
and then i will get a new carry new
 

227
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,029
and then i will get a new carry new
carry

228
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
carry
 

229
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,270
carry
if it's bigger than 10 i get a new carry

230
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
if it's bigger than 10 i get a new carry
 

231
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,310
if it's bigger than 10 i get a new carry
and then this number for example if it's

232
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
and then this number for example if it's
 

233
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,029
and then this number for example if it's
10 and now i i just want to keep a zero

234
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
10 and now i i just want to keep a zero
 

235
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:29,670
10 and now i i just want to keep a zero
right

236
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
right
 

237
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,830
right
yeah that's what he does here like if a

238
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
yeah that's what he does here like if a
 

239
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,029
yeah that's what he does here like if a
carry is zero

240
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
carry is zero
 

241
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,629
carry is zero
means we don't need to continue to look

242
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
means we don't need to continue to look
 

243
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,230
means we don't need to continue to look
to the left right

244
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
to the left right
 

245
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,350
to the left right
but be careful at the end when you enter

246
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
but be careful at the end when you enter
 

247
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,790
but be careful at the end when you enter
99 plus one

248
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
99 plus one
 

249
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,430
99 plus one
and then you only have two two two two

250
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
and then you only have two two two two
 

251
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,270
and then you only have two two two two
numbers in the right you become zero and

252
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
numbers in the right you become zero and
 

253
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,150
numbers in the right you become zero and
zero right

254
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
zero right
 

255
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,909
zero right
and in this case there will be carry

256
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
and in this case there will be carry
 

257
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,510
and in this case there will be carry
carry will be one you need to put this

258
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
carry will be one you need to put this
 

259
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:49,830
carry will be one you need to put this
one

260
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
one
 

261
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,430
one
at the beginning so a dot insert zero c

262
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
at the beginning so a dot insert zero c
 

263
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,710
at the beginning so a dot insert zero c
let's put a one put a c right anyway

264
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
let's put a one put a c right anyway
 

265
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,749
let's put a one put a c right anyway
yeah a dot insert zero c you put a one

266
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
yeah a dot insert zero c you put a one
 

267
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,430
yeah a dot insert zero c you put a one
at the beginning so if the ray will

268
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
at the beginning so if the ray will
 

269
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,830
at the beginning so if the ray will
become one zero zero got it

270
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840
become one zero zero got it
 

271
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,670
become one zero zero got it
yes

272
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
yes
 

273
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,270
yes
so fast looks so easy

274
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280

 

275
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:22,469

can you see me

276
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479

 

277
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,510

every time connect

278
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
every time connect
 

279

every time connect
every time okay let's say it's very

280
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
every time okay let's say it's very
 

281
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,270
every time okay let's say it's very
clear

282
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
clear
 

283
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,909
clear
yes okay don't don't just don't shake

00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
we can't see 192.168.1
 

289
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,950
we can't see 192.168.1
we don't need that computer on thank you

290

let's do this uh one uh let's do uh
 

303
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:12,309
let's do this uh one uh let's do uh
99 okay first there you

304
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319

 

305
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,510

minus one here c equals zero yeah and

306
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
minus one here c equals zero yeah and
 

307
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,510
minus one here c equals zero yeah and
then i need to add a one to the last

308
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
then i need to add a one to the last
 

309
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,670
then i need to add a one to the last
last digit okay y

310
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
last digit okay y
 

311
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,629
last digit okay y
and wires yeah look at them

312
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
and wires yeah look at them
 

313
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,230
and wires yeah look at them
a n plus equals c c

314
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
a n plus equals c c
 

315
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,670
a n plus equals c c
equals a n divided by 10 the

316
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
equals a n divided by 10 the
 

317
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,790
equals a n divided by 10 the
updated carry and then and i just need

318
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
updated carry and then and i just need
 

319
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,710
updated carry and then and i just need
the one digit

320
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
the one digit
 

321
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,469
the one digit
and if c equals zero break

322
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
and if c equals zero break
 

323
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,189
and if c equals zero break
okay then here if c bigger than zero

324
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199

 

325
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,589

we need to insert it in in the at the

326
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
we need to insert it in in the at the
 

327
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,550
we need to insert it in in the at the
beginning here a dot what eric

328
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
beginning here a dot what eric
 

329
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,830

00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,350
insert yeah the first thing the
beginning

334
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
beginning
 

335
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,710
beginning
zero and then and return

336
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
zero and then and return
 

337
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,629
zero and then and return
a okay let's try if we print

338
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
a okay let's try if we print
 

339
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,830
a okay let's try if we print
plus one it should give me

340
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
plus one it should give me
 

341
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,270
plus one it should give me
100 yeah

342
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280

 

343
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,950

oh no that's not right you become 91 so

344
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
oh no that's not right you become 91 so
 

345
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,390
oh no that's not right you become 91 so
there's something wrong okay

346
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
there's something wrong okay
 

347
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,390
there's something wrong okay
let me check um

348
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400

 

349
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,029

and you can learn minus one let's let's

350
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
and you can learn minus one let's let's
 

351
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,430
and you can learn minus one let's let's
try

352
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
try
 

353
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,790
try
see plus equals one will become zero ten

354
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
see plus equals one will become zero ten
 

355
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,389
see plus equals one will become zero ten
yeah and bigger than uh n bigger than

356
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
yeah and bigger than uh n bigger than
 

357
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,670
yeah and bigger than uh n bigger than
zero

358
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
zero
 

359
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,070
zero
okay okay look because we need to

360
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
okay okay look because we need to
 

361
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,990
okay okay look because we need to
decrement the one we forgot the least

362
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
decrement the one we forgot the least
 

363
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,230
decrement the one we forgot the least
i forgot n minus equals one yeah we need

364
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
i forgot n minus equals one yeah we need
 

365
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,990
i forgot n minus equals one yeah we need
to decrement it

366
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
to decrement it
 

367
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,630
to decrement it
yeah there's a problem with that yeah

368
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
yeah there's a problem with that yeah
 

369
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,550
yeah there's a problem with that yeah
it's 100 yeah we forgot this yeah

370
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
it's 100 yeah we forgot this yeah
 

371
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,030
it's 100 yeah we forgot this yeah
because when you move to a long belonger

372
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
because when you move to a long belonger
 

373
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,949
because when you move to a long belonger
you see that's why we need to do this on

374
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
you see that's why we need to do this on
 

375
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,870
you see that's why we need to do this on
coding because when i talk i may miss

376
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
coding because when i talk i may miss
 

377
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,910
coding because when i talk i may miss
some details

378
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
some details
 

379
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,550
some details
but when i put it on computer yeah and

380
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
but when i put it on computer yeah and
 

381
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,470
but when i put it on computer yeah and
then i can check right

382
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
then i can check right
 

383
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,070
then i can check right
do you get it yeah because let

384
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
do you get it yeah because let
 

385
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,990
do you get it yeah because let
line 9 14 i miss this 914

386
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
line 9 14 i miss this 914
 

387
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,190
line 9 14 i miss this 914
right yeah because i need to and

388
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
right yeah because i need to and
 

389
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,910
right yeah because i need to and
if n is not then it's not

390
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
if n is not then it's not
 

391
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,910
if n is not then it's not
it's not changing and this might we

392
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
it's not changing and this might we
 

393
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,310
it's not changing and this might we
might have a problem okay let's try this

394
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
might have a problem okay let's try this
 

395
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,030
might have a problem okay let's try this
try uh 100

396
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,040
try uh 100
 

397
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,630
try uh 100
123 okay let's see

398
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
123 okay let's see
 

399
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,070
123 okay let's see
i okay one two three four five okay

400
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
i okay one two three four five okay
 

401
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,190
i okay one two three four five okay
so one it'll be one two

402
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
so one it'll be one two
 

403
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,150
so one it'll be one two
three four six yes you see that's plus

404
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
three four six yes you see that's plus
 

405
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,389
three four six yes you see that's plus
one okay any number you want to try

406
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
one okay any number you want to try
 

407
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,310
one okay any number you want to try
one two five six and nine nine ten means

408
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
one two five six and nine nine ten means
 

409
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,269
one two five six and nine nine ten means
too much too much one two three four

410
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
too much too much one two three four
 

411
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:47,829
too much too much one two three four
five

412
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
five
 

413
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,750
five
one two nine nine okay so you should

414
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
one two nine nine okay so you should
 

415
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,870
one two nine nine okay so you should
give me one hundred

416
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
give me one hundred
 

417
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,389
give me one hundred
thirty three hundred s yes

418
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
thirty three hundred s yes
 

419
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,430
thirty three hundred s yes
yeah you see one three zero zero okay

420
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
yeah you see one three zero zero okay
 

421
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,509
yeah you see one three zero zero okay
one zero zero

422
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519

 

423
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,190

okay uh let's do this one more time

424
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
okay uh let's do this one more time
 

425
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,509
okay uh let's do this one more time
okay so look this is getting the length

426
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
okay so look this is getting the length
 

427
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,310
okay so look this is getting the length
of the a

428
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
of the a
 

429
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,870
of the a
carry and then this num what's the line

430
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
carry and then this num what's the line
 

431
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,710
carry and then this num what's the line
number seven can you tell me line number

432
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
number seven can you tell me line number
 

433
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,630
number seven can you tell me line number
seven

434
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
seven
 

435
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:23,110
seven
a minus one

436
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120

 

437
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,509

and then past one yeah and plus one and

438
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
and then past one yeah and plus one and
 

439
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,870
and then past one yeah and plus one and
you will become ten right

440
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
you will become ten right
 

441
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,190
you will become ten right
but we don't want to stall more than ten

442
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
but we don't want to stall more than ten
 

443
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,470
but we don't want to stall more than ten
more than nine in one

444
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
more than nine in one
 

445
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,550
more than nine in one
single place so look let's write that

446
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
single place so look let's write that
 

447
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,949
single place so look let's write that
10 divided by 10 that c will currently

448
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
10 divided by 10 that c will currently
 

449
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,990
10 divided by 10 that c will currently
one yeah

450
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
one yeah
 

451
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,110
one yeah
and 10 modulus 10 will be zero

452
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
and 10 modulus 10 will be zero
 

453
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,509
and 10 modulus 10 will be zero
and if carry is zero then we just break

454
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
and if carry is zero then we just break
 

455
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,470
and if carry is zero then we just break
otherwise we

456
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
otherwise we
 

457
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,269
otherwise we
we update the carry along the way to the

458
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
we update the carry along the way to the
 

459
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:47,670
we update the carry along the way to the
left

460
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
left
 

461
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,470
left
yeah and after this loop if we find out

462
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
yeah and after this loop if we find out
 

463
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:50,949
yeah and after this loop if we find out
the c

464
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
the c
 

465
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,470
the c
is still bigger than zero what does it

466
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
is still bigger than zero what does it
 

467
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,230
is still bigger than zero what does it
mean what has been 15 and then 16

468
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
mean what has been 15 and then 16
 

469
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,949
mean what has been 15 and then 16
what does it mean 15 and 16. yeah

470
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959
what does it mean 15 and 16. yeah
 

471
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,350
what does it mean 15 and 16. yeah
what does it mean if carrie

472
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
what does it mean if carrie
 

473
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,829
what does it mean if carrie
is bigger than z right then we put an

474
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
is bigger than z right then we put an
 

475
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:08,630
is bigger than z right then we put an
extra

476
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
extra
 

477
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,910
extra
yeah on the next on the beginning

478
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
yeah on the next on the beginning
 

479
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,630
yeah on the next on the beginning
even 99 that's what you mean even 99

480
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
even 99 that's what you mean even 99
 

481
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,590
even 99 that's what you mean even 99
plus 1

482
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
plus 1
 

483
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,150
plus 1
that would be 100 right but now we only

484
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
that would be 100 right but now we only
 

485
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,910
that would be 100 right but now we only
have two zeros right

486
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
have two zeros right
 

487
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,350
have two zeros right
so now we need to put a one at the

488
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
so now we need to put a one at the
 

489
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,430
so now we need to put a one at the
beginning all right

490
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
beginning all right
 

491
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,829
beginning all right
yeah do you get it yeah okay any

492
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
yeah do you get it yeah okay any
 

493
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:27,990
yeah do you get it yeah okay any
questions

494
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
