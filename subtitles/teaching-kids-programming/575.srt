1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,440
numbers

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,120
and the right side needs to be bigger

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,120
than the no I'm just in pregnancy

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:21,119
this is the loot

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,480
um these are the leaves with no children

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:30,960
right at least the trunk and each node

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,960
has almost two kids with me because

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,700
yeah look it's upside down right yeah

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,559
this is the tree yeah yeah but it still

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,200
doesn't look like okay this one looks

12
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,940
like a tree

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,300
that doesn't look like a tree this looks

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,300
like a tree

15
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,559
okay

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,180
okay yeah yeah this is Christmas tree

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,180
okay the whole Christmas Tree

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,520
Finance tree is a tree tree is a data

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,400
structure especially how we store the

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,820
same time yeah yeah specifically okay

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,320
so binary tree is also attack directly

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,540
assigned to the graph

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,740
and it's a graph right what's the order

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,080
we can perform on the tree

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,180
perfect search and better search okay

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,860
perfect search perfect search professor

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,600
in this particular tree what kind of

28
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,680
order is this one two three four five

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,780
six seven

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,820
level by level we use the keyword and

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,880
therefore surge we actually talked about

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,680
different kinds of deficit deficits put

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,960
all the you know the post order right

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,180
note left to right yeah pre-order

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,360
because we reach the North First in

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,360
order

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,970
[Music]

38
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,600
the nose on the left tree is smaller

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,100
than strictly smaller than the nodes on

40
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,040
the right are strictly bigger than the

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,439
null if we perform uh in order we get

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,280
the Salted list right if it's a buying

43
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,140
research

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,619
exactly okay so for example this

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,220
breakfast search Okay D5 let's say F

46
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,220
loot

47
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:20,220
assuming the root is not none okay

48
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:24,420
Q equals TQ all right we put the nude in

49
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,000
wire Q we can use again right wire kills

50
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,300
current equals

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,860
Q dot Pub left then we can yield it

52
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,760
right yet

53
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:39,560
current we visit the note if carbon dot

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,560
left Q dot a 10

55
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,560
current 11. if we have a left node we

56
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:49,200
push it to the Q is current or right

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,060
Q dot append current or right and that's

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,700
it right if we're using a year that's it

59
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,580
yeah let's suppose such Okay so

60
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,739
today's question if we change this

61
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,680
to stack

62
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,060
what happened

63
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,560
if we change this to step what happened

64
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,239
we know

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,420
yeah

66
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,420
okay

67
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,560
here is

68
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,560
FIFA first name first one yeah

69
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,140
which is lost in first out yeah

70
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,140
different way of saying okay

71
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,840
okay good that's very good okay thank

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,040
you this is yeah and if we're changing

73
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,040
this to stack what happened

74
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,700
so on this tree so if we change it to

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,680
set what order we can get you know let's

76
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,400
say right let's do this

77
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,400
step okay

78
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,180
one now at the beginning we put a one in

79
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,220
right

80
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,599
now we're taking one hour right here we

81
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,280
take one now you know for the stack

82
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,140
there's no problem we need to change

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,500
this to pop okay

84
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,599
so one take it off okay let's resize one

85
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,000
what's the kit of one left and right

86
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,879
right two and three yeah so we pushing

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,260
two in first right two and then three

88
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,459
okay

89
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:16,979
yeah and then okay so the next time

90
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,840
which element we take it out and then we

91
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:22,620
put it here three

92
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,620
what's the kit of three six

93
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,979
and six and seven

94
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,660
okay and then seven seven okay what do

95
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,300
we take out we'll put it here okay one

96
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,639
to the kingdom seven nothing right and

97
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,320
then what's next what's a kid of six we

98
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,500
take it out six

99
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,660
what's the kid of six nothing two two

100
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,120
okay we take it out two

101
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,000
what's the kid of two one five

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,139
five four and five and then we take the

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,300
fire out

104
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,900
and then we take the fall out one three

105
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,000
seven six two five uh two one okay four

106
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,620
four sorry two five four is it two by

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,620
four yeah

108
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,919
do we make a mistake no you just wrote

109
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,860
it wrong okay okay so one three seven

110
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,440
six one three seven two five four okay

111
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:14,580
what's this order

112
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:18,440
is it no to right left

113
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,660
yeah so this is reverse pre-order

114
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,440
reverse pre-order okay

115
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:28,699
how about I want to at least pre-order

116
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,699
thing what should I change

117
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,400
left and right look this one is reverse

118
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,259
pre-order

119
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,120
I want this pre-order

120
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:43,820
so look at the difference I'm saying

121
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,840
instead I'm setting for breakfast search

122
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,979
instead of going left to right you're

123
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,280
going right to left that's what I'm

124
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:53,639
saying so in when you pop two when you

125
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,460
get two and three you put it put you put

126
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,740
this three two instead of two three we

127
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,919
already changed at least from Q to stack

128
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,020
it's not perfect anymore it's a yeah

129
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,000
we change this queue to stack we change

130
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,600
the list to pop and then we perform

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,720
these we get the note right left now

132
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,820
this is the note we visit the right and

133
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,680
then we visit the left tree this is what

134
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,620
we get we want to visit the left tree

135
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,880
first so look this is not left to right

136
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,220
what's the difference

137
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,160
what's the difference here right

138
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,039
yeah so in which places you are pushing

139
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,259
to the kit determine this order left and

140
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,479
right right yes look I'm pushing the

141
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,580
left and right right because this is the

142
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,860
step I push the left here I push the

143
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,259
right tree here what's the order of

144
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,139
taking these I push it and I take it

145
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,120
what's the order

146
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:47,639
ah yeah yeah

147
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,360
okay I want to get the AR so what do I

148
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,120
do

149
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,080
believe us yeah so we push the button

150
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,940
first

151
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,120
pushing the right first and then left

152
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,759
right so all you need to do is

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,960
switch those around so yeah and then

154
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,220
that that's it

155
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,080
eight

156
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,520
nine

157
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,080
10

158
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,539
11 okay

159
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,039
this is a stack at the beginning one

160
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,319
okay

161
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,259
remember we push the right first and

162
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,699
then left okay what's the kit of

163
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,620
one

164
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,380
two and three now we push the right

165
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,180
three first so we put a three and two uh

166
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,599
obviously one we will put it here right

167
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,300
we take the two hour right yeah

168
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,000
what's that kit of two four and five

169
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,940
okay but we push the five and

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,699
four okay take the four out right

171
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,440
what's the cable for eight or nine yeah

172
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,419
we'll pushing the nine and eight okay

173
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,419
and then we take a out

174
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:52,919
nothing right

175
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:55,139
okay then five nothing okay three we

176
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,240
take it out what's lucky that's three

177
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,660
six and seven yeah we'll put you the

178
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,500
seven and six next

179
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,920
six yeah

180
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,160
eleven so eleven ten right

181
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,860
[Music]

182
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,680
next ten nothing

183
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:18,539
nothing next eleven nothing

184
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,560
next seven nothing one two four eight

185
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:24,360
nine

186
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:27,419
five three six ten eleven seven

187
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,060
this is the third pre-order

188
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:32,459
note left to right okay if you want to

189
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,080
do this using recursion easier we know

190
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,279
that already it's simple we say

191
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,320
everything

192
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,300
you can see right if loot if loot is

193
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,680
none well not loot

194
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,880
return

195
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,320
then

196
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:51,240
we visit the no first right so yeah

197
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:56,220
yeah the root of value or root right and

198
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:59,160
yelled from yes from that first search

199
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,860
Blue Dot left and then you know what's

200
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,720
next yeah from that first Search doodle

201
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:07,019
right we're just changing the professors

202
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,940
using the Q from Q to stack and changing

203
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,540
the top left to pop

204
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,519
and I will also change the order of

205
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,740
pushing the left key to the right kid

206
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,300
right because if we're pushing the left

207
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,060
key first

208
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,740
we get it last because it's a step by

209
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,380
first in that cell but if we want to get

210
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,440
the left left tree first we need to push

211
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,779
the right tree into the stack all right

212
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,080
does it make sense okay so what have you

213
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,080
learned today

214
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,519
we learned about anybody come on

215
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,660
complete the sentence to finish the

216
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,500
lesson

217
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,779
we learned about we learned about

218
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,320
um depth search

219
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,480
using yeah using stack using stack and

220
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,300
it's very easy to transform from

221
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,820
Professor so we just simply change the

222
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,500
implementation of prefer search from Q

223
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,080
to stack

224
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,480
and then from top left to pop because

225
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,860
the stack if you want to get items that

226
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,519
you get it from the Valencia which is

227
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,380
pop and also we change we swap along the

228
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,660
order of pushing the left tree and the

229
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,000
right tree all right yes

230
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,519
okay

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,420
that's it for today bye

232
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,420
bye bye bye
