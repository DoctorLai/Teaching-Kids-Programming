00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
so today
 

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,790
so today
we're going to talk about the

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
we're going to talk about the
 

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,429
we're going to talk about the
important the most known salting

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
important the most known salting
 

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,710
important the most known salting
eggplant which is called

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
eggplant which is called
 

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,310
eggplant which is called
quick salt algorithm yeah quick stop so

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
quick salt algorithm yeah quick stop so
 

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,590
quick salt algorithm yeah quick stop so
can you tell me what it does

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
can you tell me what it does
 

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,570
can you tell me what it does
quick thought

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:36,580
quick thought
 

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,950

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,069
[Music]
yes yeah

20
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
yes yeah
 

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,229
yes yeah
what does it mean i mean quick sauce sit

22
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
what does it mean i mean quick sauce sit
 

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,310
what does it mean i mean quick sauce sit
down it

24
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
down it
 

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,389
down it
means i think it means sorting

26
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
means i think it means sorting
 

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,590
means i think it means sorting
salting quickly exactly so

28
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
salting quickly exactly so
 

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,470
salting quickly exactly so
look look if we're given the number

30
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,480

 

31
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:11,830

[Music]

32
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840

 

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,950

one two five six one two

34
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
one two five six one two
 

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,109
one two five six one two
five six okay

36
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119

 

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,109

okay so that's the sorting saltine

38
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
okay so that's the sorting saltine
 

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,149
okay so that's the sorting saltine
agreement okay

40
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
agreement okay
 

41
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,590
agreement okay
so so how do we this quick saw how how

42
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
so so how do we this quick saw how how
 

43
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,630
so so how do we this quick saw how how
does it work i mean

44
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
does it work i mean
 

45
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,749
does it work i mean
look if given uh like two five

46
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
look if given uh like two five
 

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,950
look if given uh like two five
six nine six three okay

48
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
six nine six three okay
 

49
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,230
six nine six three okay
uh maybe one more number one okay

50
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
uh maybe one more number one okay
 

51
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,109
uh maybe one more number one okay
so first of all how it works is that we

52
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
so first of all how it works is that we
 

53
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,390
so first of all how it works is that we
need to pick a number

54
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
need to pick a number
 

55
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,749
need to pick a number
this number can be any any number random

56
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
this number can be any any number random
 

57
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,469
this number can be any any number random
number

58
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
number
 

59
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,230
number
or the first number or you can pick them

60
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
or the first number or you can pick them
 

61
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,910
or the first number or you can pick them
in the number or you pick the last

62
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
in the number or you pick the last
 

63
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,270
in the number or you pick the last
number any number

64
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
number any number
 

65
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,429
number any number
okay so can you pick can you pick a

66
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
okay so can you pick can you pick a
 

67
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,870
okay so can you pick can you pick a
number

68
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
number
 

69
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,310
number
just any number two all right

70
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
just any number two all right
 

71
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,149
just any number two all right
okay two so okay i pick two right

72
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
okay two so okay i pick two right
 

73
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,030
okay two so okay i pick two right
okay so now find the elements which are

74
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
okay so now find the elements which are
 

75
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,190
okay so now find the elements which are
smaller than two

76
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
smaller than two
 

77
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,550
smaller than two
one one okay

78
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
one one okay
 

79
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,309
one one okay
you find the one yes okay one

80
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
you find the one yes okay one
 

81
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,869
you find the one yes okay one
um what find the elements which are

82
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
um what find the elements which are
 

83
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,949
um what find the elements which are
bigger than two

84
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
bigger than two
 

85
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,390
bigger than two
three five six

86
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
three five six
 

87
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,670
three five six
three five six

88
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
three five six
 

89
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,030
three five six
okay okay yeah three five six or maybe

90
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
okay okay yeah three five six or maybe
 

91
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,309
okay okay yeah three five six or maybe
in the order yeah five six uh which is

92
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
in the order yeah five six uh which is
 

93
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,750
in the order yeah five six uh which is
five six three yeah

94
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760

 

95
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,150

and find the number uh maybe i put a one

96
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
and find the number uh maybe i put a one
 

97
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,270
and find the number uh maybe i put a one
more zero here okay

98
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
more zero here okay
 

99
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,869
more zero here okay
so let's become zero one okay yeah

100
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
so let's become zero one okay yeah
 

101
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,670
so let's become zero one okay yeah
and if i put another two here okay yeah

102
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
and if i put another two here okay yeah
 

103
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,150
and if i put another two here okay yeah
so

104
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
so
 

105
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,750
so
how many twos are there there are two

106
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
how many twos are there there are two
 

107
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,509
how many twos are there there are two
right two so two

108
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
right two so two
 

109
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,190
right two so two
two solely so now

110
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
two solely so now
 

111
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,550
two solely so now
we got a smaller part the

112
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
we got a smaller part the
 

113
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,710
we got a smaller part the
equal part and the bigger part

114
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
equal part and the bigger part
 

115
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,229
equal part and the bigger part
and the answer is to add at least

116
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
and the answer is to add at least
 

117
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,869
and the answer is to add at least
calling itself solving this using the

118
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
calling itself solving this using the
 

119
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,830
calling itself solving this using the
quick sort

120
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
quick sort
 

121
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,990
quick sort
and solving this using the quick sort

122
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
and solving this using the quick sort
 

123
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,750
and solving this using the quick sort
and then put these together

124
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
and then put these together
 

125
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,550
and then put these together
so this quick saw would become zero one

126
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
so this quick saw would become zero one
 

127
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,990
so this quick saw would become zero one
yeah if it's sorted

128
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
yeah if it's sorted
 

129
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,550
yeah if it's sorted
and this is two two right and then hit

130
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
and this is two two right and then hit
 

131
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,869
and this is two two right and then hit
this one after sorted

132
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
this one after sorted
 

133
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,949
this one after sorted
you can pick any number from here again

134
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
you can pick any number from here again
 

135
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,470
you can pick any number from here again
like three yeah

136
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:22,480
like three yeah
 

137
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,270
like three yeah
and then put a smaller one before three

138
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
and then put a smaller one before three
 

139
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,070
and then put a smaller one before three
uh

140
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
uh
 

141
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,949
uh
bigger one after three yeah and then

142
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
bigger one after three yeah and then
 

143
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,949
bigger one after three yeah and then
this become one

144
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
this become one
 

145
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,630
this become one
three five six so you see after salting

146
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
three five six so you see after salting
 

147
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,630
three five six so you see after salting
and i put all the pieces together do you

148
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
and i put all the pieces together do you
 

149
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,190
and i put all the pieces together do you
see it

150
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
see it
 

151
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,750
see it
now it's insulted do you understand so

152
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
now it's insulted do you understand so
 

153
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,470
now it's insulted do you understand so
so the

154
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
so the
 

155
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,149
so the
the how it works is that i pick a number

156
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
the how it works is that i pick a number
 

157
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,190
the how it works is that i pick a number
yeah and i separate this into three bits

158
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
yeah and i separate this into three bits
 

159
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,589
yeah and i separate this into three bits
the ones which are smaller strictly

160
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
the ones which are smaller strictly
 

161
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,270
the ones which are smaller strictly
smaller the one which are

162
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
smaller the one which are
 

163
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,309
smaller the one which are
equal and the one which is a bigger yes

164
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
equal and the one which is a bigger yes
 

165
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,509
equal and the one which is a bigger yes
yes we know this this small

166
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
yes we know this this small
 

167
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,070
yes we know this this small
equal is in the middle but this may not

168
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
equal is in the middle but this may not
 

169
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,429
equal is in the middle but this may not
be in order right

170
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
be in order right
 

171
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,830
be in order right
then we're calling itself recursively

172
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
then we're calling itself recursively
 

173
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,550
then we're calling itself recursively
remember to determine

174
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
remember to determine
 

175
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,070
remember to determine
we call a recursive quick sort function

176
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
we call a recursive quick sort function
 

177
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,110
we call a recursive quick sort function
to solve these two parts am i right yeah

178
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
to solve these two parts am i right yeah
 

179
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,150
to solve these two parts am i right yeah
okay so now can you tell me how how

180
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
okay so now can you tell me how how
 

181
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,270
okay so now can you tell me how how
should i pick this number

182
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280

 

183
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,390

i want to pick the number that as the

184
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
i want to pick the number that as the
 

185
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,790
i want to pick the number that as the
smaller part and the bigger parts are as

186
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
smaller part and the bigger parts are as
 

187
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,430
smaller part and the bigger parts are as
e

188
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
e
 

189
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,550
e
is equal right as as many as equal right

190
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
is equal right as as many as equal right
 

191
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,070
is equal right as as many as equal right
yeah do you understand if i pick a

192
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
yeah do you understand if i pick a
 

193
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,830
yeah do you understand if i pick a
number which is zero

194
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
number which is zero
 

195
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,350
number which is zero
then what happens if you pick the number

196
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
then what happens if you pick the number
 

197
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,230
then what happens if you pick the number
zero then there's no number smaller than

198
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
zero then there's no number smaller than
 

199
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,510
zero then there's no number smaller than
zero right

200
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
zero right
 

201
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,430
zero right
and so this bit will be like nothing

202
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
and so this bit will be like nothing
 

203
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,510
and so this bit will be like nothing
right and then all the elements are on

204
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
right and then all the elements are on
 

205
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,950
right and then all the elements are on
the right hand side this is not

206
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
the right hand side this is not
 

207
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,990
the right hand side this is not
efficient right every time you just

208
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
efficient right every time you just
 

209
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,150
efficient right every time you just
soft sort uh thought one element that's

210
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
soft sort uh thought one element that's
 

211
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,510
soft sort uh thought one element that's
very slow but these

212
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
very slow but these
 

213
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,830
very slow but these
every time i partition it into three

214
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
every time i partition it into three
 

215
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,870
every time i partition it into three
parts

216
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
parts
 

217
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,830
parts
yeah so it's quicker so i want to pick a

218
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
yeah so it's quicker so i want to pick a
 

219
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,029
yeah so it's quicker so i want to pick a
pivot number which

220
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
pivot number which
 

221
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,749
pivot number which
we call this preview pivot yeah pv

222
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
we call this preview pivot yeah pv
 

223
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,189
we call this preview pivot yeah pv
number give me like

224
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
number give me like
 

225
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,990
number give me like
pivot yeah you can one stretch it you

226
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
pivot yeah you can one stretch it you
 

227
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,790
pivot yeah you can one stretch it you
can pick a

228
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
can pick a
 

229
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,310
can pick a
pivot number which is the random

230
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
pivot number which is the random
 

231
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,870
pivot number which is the random
speaker any random yeah or you can pick

232
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
speaker any random yeah or you can pick
 

233
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,909
speaker any random yeah or you can pick
the one which is

234
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
the one which is
 

235
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,990
the one which is
in the medium remember in a medium

236
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
in the medium remember in a medium
 

237
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,909
in the medium remember in a medium
remember we talk about the medium yeah

238
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
remember we talk about the medium yeah
 

239
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,909
remember we talk about the medium yeah
like one two two one two three four

240
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
like one two two one two three four
 

241
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,830
like one two two one two three four
eight one two three four what's the

242
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
eight one two three four what's the
 

243
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,310
eight one two three four what's the
medium

244
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320

 

245
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,469

what the medium is these these two

246
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
what the medium is these these two
 

247
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,150
what the medium is these these two
divided by two yeah so two point five

248
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
divided by two yeah so two point five
 

249
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,270
divided by two yeah so two point five
but there's no medium right

250
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
but there's no medium right
 

251
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,870
but there's no medium right
very close to medium so we can pick two

252
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
very close to medium so we can pick two
 

253
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,710
very close to medium so we can pick two
or three right

254
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
or three right
 

255
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,029
or three right
but this requires another processing so

256
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
but this requires another processing so
 

257
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,230
but this requires another processing so
normally it's not very

258
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
normally it's not very
 

259
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,310
normally it's not very
practical so we just pick a random

260
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
practical so we just pick a random
 

261
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,510
practical so we just pick a random
number right

262
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
number right
 

263
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,270
number right
okay so now i'm going to implement this

264
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
okay so now i'm going to implement this
 

265
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,870
okay so now i'm going to implement this
quick thought okay

266
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
quick thought okay
 

267
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,830
quick thought okay
so can you tell helping help me if you

268
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
so can you tell helping help me if you
 

269
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,189
so can you tell helping help me if you
can okay

270
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
can okay
 

271
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,150
can okay
define quicksort let's call it numbers

272
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
define quicksort let's call it numbers
 

273
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,710
define quicksort let's call it numbers
okay so now what do we check we need to

274
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
okay so now what do we check we need to
 

275
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,790
okay so now what do we check we need to
check we need to check if

276
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
check we need to check if
 

277
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,510
check we need to check if
first of all if the length of the event

278
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
first of all if the length of the event
 

279
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,189
first of all if the length of the event
even the size of the

280
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
even the size of the
 

281
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,430
even the size of the
number we want to sort if it's smaller

282
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
number we want to sort if it's smaller
 

283
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,110
number we want to sort if it's smaller
and or equaler than one what do we do

284
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
and or equaler than one what do we do
 

285
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,469
and or equaler than one what do we do
if it's just one number or if it's

286
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
if it's just one number or if it's
 

287
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,150
if it's just one number or if it's
nothing what do we do we just return it

288
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
nothing what do we do we just return it
 

289
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,629
nothing what do we do we just return it
right

290
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
right
 

291
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,790
right
if the number is already sorted if one

292
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
if the number is already sorted if one
 

293
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,990
if the number is already sorted if one
number is already sorted

294
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
number is already sorted
 

295
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,270
number is already sorted
right yes yes so return

296
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
right yes yes so return
 

297
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,590
right yes yes so return
return one and because the size is

298
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
return one and because the size is
 

299
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,230
return one and because the size is
smaller than one then we return one okay

300
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
smaller than one then we return one okay
 

301
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,990
smaller than one then we return one okay
now now yeah now we need to find the

302
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
now now yeah now we need to find the
 

303
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,270
now now yeah now we need to find the
parts which is the smaller bigger or

304
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
parts which is the smaller bigger or
 

305
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,749
parts which is the smaller bigger or
equal right so we have three three bits

306
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
equal right so we have three three bits
 

307
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,309
equal right so we have three three bits
now

308
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
now
 

309
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,469
now
we first of all try the number or pivot

310
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
we first of all try the number or pivot
 

311
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,070
we first of all try the number or pivot
number so pivot

312
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
number so pivot
 

313
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,070
number so pivot
which yield a pivot don't do that nobody

314
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
which yield a pivot don't do that nobody
 

315
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,710
which yield a pivot don't do that nobody
will see enough pv number

316
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
will see enough pv number
 

317
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,830
will see enough pv number
we can pick the first one last one or

318
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
we can pick the first one last one or
 

319
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,909
we can pick the first one last one or
or the random one yeah if you want to

320
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
or the random one yeah if you want to
 

321
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,510
or the random one yeah if you want to
pick the first one is and

322
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
pick the first one is and
 

323
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,070
pick the first one is and
zero right yeah but if you want to pick

324
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
zero right yeah but if you want to pick
 

325
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,550
zero right yeah but if you want to pick
a random one i i i told you

326
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
a random one i i i told you
 

327
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,990
a random one i i i told you
i i i picked random which is random

328
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
i i i picked random which is random
 

329
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,550
i i i picked random which is random
and then you can say choice okay this is

330
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
and then you can say choice okay this is
 

331
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,670
and then you can say choice okay this is
interesting choice

332
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
interesting choice
 

333
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,309
interesting choice
and so what does it mean is that given a

334
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
and so what does it mean is that given a
 

335
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,270
and so what does it mean is that given a
list of choice

336
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
list of choice
 

337
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,029
list of choice
and very yes and like london to give me

338
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
and very yes and like london to give me
 

339
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,589
and very yes and like london to give me
one okay just one random number okay

340
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
one okay just one random number okay
 

341
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,110
one okay just one random number okay
yeah okay so now i want to have three

342
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
yeah okay so now i want to have three
 

343
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,430
yeah okay so now i want to have three
parts equal equal part yeah

344
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
parts equal equal part yeah
 

345
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,029
parts equal equal part yeah
and then small

346
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
and then small
 

347
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,230
and then small
smaller part

348
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240

 

349
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,550

and then bigger path okay

350
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560

 

351
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,070

yes yes yes

352
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
yes yes yes
 

353
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,550
yes yes yes
okay now what's now we need to loop in

354
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
okay now what's now we need to loop in
 

355
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,510
okay now what's now we need to loop in
this end right

356
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
this end right
 

357
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,950
this end right
for i in

358
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
for i in
 

359
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,990
for i in
n yes yes

360
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
n yes yes
 

361
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,510
n yes yes
i know what what should we do now if

362
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
i know what what should we do now if
 

363
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,550
i know what what should we do now if
i is equals to pv

364
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
i is equals to pv
 

365
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,830
i is equals to pv
then we we push this pivot append

366
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
then we we push this pivot append
 

367
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,309
then we we push this pivot append
okay a pen or a pen equals a point i

368
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
okay a pen or a pen equals a point i
 

369
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,230
okay a pen or a pen equals a point i
asked if look as if we can short as air

370
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
asked if look as if we can short as air
 

371
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,629
asked if look as if we can short as air
if

372
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
if
 

373
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,150
if
okay air if yeah else if

374
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
okay air if yeah else if
 

375
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,589
okay air if yeah else if
i is bigger than pivot

376
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
i is bigger than pivot
 

377
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,830
i is bigger than pivot
then what was that bigger

378
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840

 

379
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,390

bigger a pen

380
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400

 

381
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,070

i and can you tell me what's next

382
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
i and can you tell me what's next
 

383
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,829
i and can you tell me what's next
s right smaller

384
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
s right smaller
 

385
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,310
s right smaller
yeah a pen

386
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
yeah a pen
 

387
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,350
yeah a pen
i why yes yes

388
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
i why yes yes
 

389
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,269
i why yes yes
now we have the equal part smaller and

390
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
now we have the equal part smaller and
 

391
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,710
now we have the equal part smaller and
bigger part now the

392
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
bigger part now the
 

393
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,230
bigger part now the
the last bit so how how can we do this

394
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
the last bit so how how can we do this
 

395
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,750
the last bit so how how can we do this
the last bit

396
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
the last bit
 

397
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,550
the last bit
the last bit okay the last bit return

398
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560

 

399
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,269

calling the save look quick so return

400
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
calling the save look quick so return
 

401
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,590
calling the save look quick so return
what quick sauce

402
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600

 

403
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,030

smaller right

404
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040

 

405
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,670

plus equal right we don't need to slow

406
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
plus equal right we don't need to slow
 

407
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,710
plus equal right we don't need to slow
that equal right

408
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
that equal right
 

409
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,110
that equal right
because it's already equal right yeah

410
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
because it's already equal right yeah
 

411
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,910
because it's already equal right yeah
because that

412
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
because that
 

413
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,710
because that
if there are three twos and we don't

414
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
if there are three twos and we don't
 

415
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,070
if there are three twos and we don't
need to solve it because it

416
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
need to solve it because it
 

417
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,870
need to solve it because it
is already in order right and then and

418
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
is already in order right and then and
 

419
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,310
is already in order right and then and
plus

420
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
plus
 

421
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,750
plus
quick sort

422
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760

 

423
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,350

what should i do here

424
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360

 

425
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,110

smaller equal and what's this what's

426
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
smaller equal and what's this what's
 

427
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,790
smaller equal and what's this what's
here we need to solve bigger

428
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
here we need to solve bigger
 

429
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,910
here we need to solve bigger
bigger yeah you see this is recursively

430
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
bigger yeah you see this is recursively
 

431
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,190
bigger yeah you see this is recursively
recursively

432
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
recursively
 

433
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,790
recursively
recursively as sorting the smaller parts

434
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
recursively as sorting the smaller parts
 

435
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,790
recursively as sorting the smaller parts
and the bigger path am right

436
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
and the bigger path am right
 

437
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,790
and the bigger path am right
yes look this is a bit

438
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
yes look this is a bit
 

439
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,150
yes look this is a bit
area look for i in n we're looking each

440
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
area look for i in n we're looking each
 

441
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,630
area look for i in n we're looking each
number

442
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
number
 

443
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,070
number
in a in a list if it's equal

444
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
in a in a list if it's equal
 

445
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,150
in a in a list if it's equal
if it's equal to pivot then we'll push

446
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
if it's equal to pivot then we'll push
 

447
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,829
if it's equal to pivot then we'll push
it to the equal

448
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
it to the equal
 

449
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,750
it to the equal
if it's bigger than pv it'll push it

450
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
if it's bigger than pv it'll push it
 

451
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,069
if it's bigger than pv it'll push it
into the bigger if it's else it should

452
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
into the bigger if it's else it should
 

453
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,509
into the bigger if it's else it should
be smaller right it pushes to the

454
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
be smaller right it pushes to the
 

455
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,269
be smaller right it pushes to the
smaller and when you're calling that

456
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
smaller and when you're calling that
 

457
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,910
smaller and when you're calling that
recursively quick saw the smaller power

458
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
recursively quick saw the smaller power
 

459
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,590
recursively quick saw the smaller power
plus equal plus the

460
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
plus equal plus the
 

461
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,470
plus equal plus the
plus quicksilver bigger and now look at

462
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
plus quicksilver bigger and now look at
 

463
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,190
plus quicksilver bigger and now look at
this one

464
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
this one
 

465
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,389
this one
we can we can replace this bit yeah

466
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
we can we can replace this bit yeah
 

467
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,870
we can we can replace this bit yeah
this bit is we can replace this bit by

468
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
this bit is we can replace this bit by
 

469
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,630
this bit is we can replace this bit by
using a simple syntax here

470
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640

 

471
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,310

we can do this look okay here yeah

472
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
we can do this look okay here yeah
 

473
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,350
we can do this look okay here yeah
i'm going to write this and then you let

474
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360
i'm going to write this and then you let
 

475
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,949
i'm going to write this and then you let
you you can tell me

476
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959

 

477
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,110

x for x what's x for x in n

478
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
x for x what's x for x in n
 

479
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,389
x for x what's x for x in n
yeah the x now is x right

480
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
yeah the x now is x right
 

481
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,350
yeah the x now is x right
but what is that x is in n every number

482
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
but what is that x is in n every number
 

483
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,829
but what is that x is in n every number
in n

484
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
in n
 

485
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,069
in n
right if x equals

486
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
right if x equals
 

487
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,069
right if x equals
pivot okay

488
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
pivot okay
 

489
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,350
pivot okay
so what should i do the smaller here

490
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
so what should i do the smaller here
 

491
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,710
so what should i do the smaller here
x for x in n if

492
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
x for x in n if
 

493
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,230
x for x in n if
x smaller than pivot okay

494
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
x smaller than pivot okay
 

495
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,829
x smaller than pivot okay
and what's bigger than pi here x for x

496
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839
and what's bigger than pi here x for x
 

497
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,030
and what's bigger than pi here x for x
x pivot okay

498
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
x pivot okay
 

499
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,750
x pivot okay
this is the same thing as this yeah and

500
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
this is the same thing as this yeah and
 

501
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,630
this is the same thing as this yeah and
we don't need this

502
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
we don't need this
 

503
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,269
we don't need this
and then return quick saw smaller plus

504
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
and then return quick saw smaller plus
 

505
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,949
and then return quick saw smaller plus
equal parts bigger right

506
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
equal parts bigger right
 

507
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,430
equal parts bigger right
yes do you understand it they do have to

508
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
yes do you understand it they do have to
 

509
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,230
yes do you understand it they do have to
put

510
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
put
 

511
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:37,910
put
quick start

512
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920

 

513
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,389

smaller part plus the equal parts past

514
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,399
smaller part plus the equal parts past
 

515
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,509
smaller part plus the equal parts past
the bigger parts

516
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
the bigger parts
 

517
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,269
the bigger parts
this is calling the smaller part every

518
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
this is calling the smaller part every
 

519
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,630
this is calling the smaller part every
time so

520
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
time so
 

521
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,150
time so
what it does is look look three

522
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
what it does is look look three
 

523
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,910
what it does is look look three
three two one five okay

524
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
three two one five okay
 

525
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,829
three two one five okay
so for example if i choose the previous

526
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
so for example if i choose the previous
 

527
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:04,069
so for example if i choose the previous
three so what what

528
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079

 

529
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,550

is on the left hand side yeah and one

530
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
is on the left hand side yeah and one
 

531
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,949
is on the left hand side yeah and one
five for example like if i say six five

532
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
five for example like if i say six five
 

533
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,629
five for example like if i say six five
okay it's on the other side six

534
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
okay it's on the other side six
 

535
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,269
okay it's on the other side six
right so this is sorted yeah this is

536
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
right so this is sorted yeah this is
 

537
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:13,670
right so this is sorted yeah this is
here

538
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
here
 

539
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,110
here
yeah two is this part smaller

540
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
yeah two is this part smaller
 

541
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,750
yeah two is this part smaller
six y is this part a six five is not in

542
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:19,760
six y is this part a six five is not in
 

543
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,110
six y is this part a six five is not in
order so i call this

544
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
order so i call this
 

545
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,670
order so i call this
chord itself to divide and conquer yeah

546
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
chord itself to divide and conquer yeah
 

547
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,269
chord itself to divide and conquer yeah
so i solve this problem

548
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
so i solve this problem
 

549
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,269
so i solve this problem
i call in the same algorithm to solve

550
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
i call in the same algorithm to solve
 

551
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,550
i call in the same algorithm to solve
the smaller parts

552
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
the smaller parts
 

553
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,190
the smaller parts
which is six five do you get it and

554
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
which is six five do you get it and
 

555
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,949
which is six five do you get it and
after calling that it will be in five

556
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
after calling that it will be in five
 

557
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,670
after calling that it will be in five
six

558
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
six
 

559
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,509
six
then i put it together that would be two

560
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
then i put it together that would be two
 

561
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,509
then i put it together that would be two
three three five six so let's get it

562
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
three three five six so let's get it
 

563
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,030
three three five six so let's get it
now it's in all insulted do you get it

564
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
now it's in all insulted do you get it
 

565
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,389
now it's in all insulted do you get it
yeah yeah so the accurate uh complexity

566
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
yeah yeah so the accurate uh complexity
 

567
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,910
yeah yeah so the accurate uh complexity
for this one can you make a guess

568
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
for this one can you make a guess
 

569
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,350
for this one can you make a guess
it's a bit difficult can you make a

570
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
it's a bit difficult can you make a
 

571
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,949
it's a bit difficult can you make a
guess is it

572
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
guess is it
 

573
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,150
guess is it
o n is it o n log

574
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,160
o n is it o n log
 

575
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,350
o n is it o n log
n or is it o n square

576
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
n or is it o n square
 

577
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,910
n or is it o n square
which one pick one just guess

578
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920

 

579
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,870

just just guess which one

580
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
just just guess which one
 

581
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,550
just just guess which one
which one don't worry don't don't worry

582
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
which one don't worry don't don't worry
 

583
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,870
which one don't worry don't don't worry
uh if you make mistakes just pick a pick

584
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
uh if you make mistakes just pick a pick
 

585
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,389
uh if you make mistakes just pick a pick
one and i'll tell you if it's right or

586
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
one and i'll tell you if it's right or
 

587
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,430
one and i'll tell you if it's right or
not

588
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
not
 

589
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,350
not
one in three the chance what do you mean

590
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
one in three the chance what do you mean
 

591
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,949
one in three the chance what do you mean
there are three choices just tell me

592
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
there are three choices just tell me
 

593
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,069
there are three choices just tell me
which one

00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079

 

595
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,269

oh i don't get it the complexity i mean

596
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
oh i don't get it the complexity i mean
 

597
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,430
oh i don't get it the complexity i mean
how how many times the computer even

there are three parts i mean calling if

618
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
there are three parts i mean calling if
 

619
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,750
there are three parts i mean calling if
they're n elements how many times

620
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:55,760
they're n elements how many times
 

621
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,470
they're n elements how many times
does it only scan one time uh once like

622
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
does it only scan one time uh once like
 

623
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,189
does it only scan one time uh once like
alignment or does it need to

624
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:01,199
alignment or does it need to
 

625
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,750
alignment or does it need to
scan multiple times

626
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760

 

627
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,910

you're not sure that's fine you're not

628
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
you're not sure that's fine you're not
 

629
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,870
you're not sure that's fine you're not
sure

630
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
sure
 

631
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,960
sure
wait you want to guess

632
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:16,970
wait you want to guess
 

633
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,470
wait you want to guess
[Music]

634
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
[Music]
 

635
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,910
[Music]
yeah yeah so definitely not this one

636
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
yeah yeah so definitely not this one
 

637
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:28,829
yeah yeah so definitely not this one
right yeah okay so is it this one

638
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839

 

639
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,590

yeah probably okay yeah

640
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
yeah probably okay yeah
 

641
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,389
yeah probably okay yeah
this is practically is always n but but

642
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
this is practically is always n but but
 

643
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,030
this is practically is always n but but
only

644
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
only
 

645
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,470
only
if you pick the favorite correctly

646
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
if you pick the favorite correctly
 

647
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,150
if you pick the favorite correctly
remember what i told you if we always

648
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
remember what i told you if we always
 

649
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,509
remember what i told you if we always
pick the smaller smallest one or big

650
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:43,519
pick the smaller smallest one or big
 

651
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,150
pick the smaller smallest one or big
largest one yeah then the complexity

652
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
largest one yeah then the complexity
 

653
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,790
largest one yeah then the complexity
will be o

654
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
will be o
 

655
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,990
will be o
and square right do you get it because

656
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
and square right do you get it because
 

657
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,710
and square right do you get it because
every time

658
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
every time
 

659
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,430
every time
you just saw the one element right and

660
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
you just saw the one element right and
 

661
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,189
you just saw the one element right and
then you need to end iterations

662
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
then you need to end iterations
 

663
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,389
then you need to end iterations
you know for each you saw it takes on

664
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
you know for each you saw it takes on
 

665
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,150
you know for each you saw it takes on
to solve one element and you need to

666
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
to solve one element and you need to
 

667
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,910
to solve one element and you need to
sort n elements so that would be n

668
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
sort n elements so that would be n
 

669
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,030
sort n elements so that would be n
square right

670
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
square right
 

671
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,629
square right
yeah but but if you pick the pivot

672
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
yeah but but if you pick the pivot
 

673
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,110
yeah but but if you pick the pivot
very cleverly you know if you pick

674
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
very cleverly you know if you pick
 

675
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,550
very cleverly you know if you pick
something in the middle you always

676
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
something in the middle you always
 

677
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,389
something in the middle you always
separate into half right

678
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
separate into half right
 

679
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,389
separate into half right
remember the binary search yeah very

680
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
remember the binary search yeah very
 

681
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,670
remember the binary search yeah very
similar yeah

682
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
similar yeah
 

683
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,670
similar yeah
remember binary search all right every

684
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
remember binary search all right every
 

685
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,750
remember binary search all right every
time you cut in half yeah

686
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
time you cut in half yeah
 

687
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,829
time you cut in half yeah
and then that will be locked in right so

688
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
and then that will be locked in right so
 

689
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:22,949
and then that will be locked in right so
that will be n log

690
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:22,959
that will be n log
 

691
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,990
that will be n log
n okay yes yeah i come back tonight uh

692
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
n okay yes yeah i come back tonight uh
 

693
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,110
n okay yes yeah i come back tonight uh
to this that

694
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
to this that
 

695
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,550
to this that
in the future you know don't worry if

696
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
in the future you know don't worry if
 

697
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,150
in the future you know don't worry if
you don't get it but this is

698
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
you don't get it but this is
 

699
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,749
you don't get it but this is
a very important agreement okay

700
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:33,759
a very important agreement okay
 

701
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:41,839
a very important agreement okay
okay say bye-bye okay
