queue and what should i do now

174
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
queue and what should i do now
 

175
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,789
queue and what should i do now
yeah but i want to pop all the left

176
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
yeah but i want to pop all the left
 

177
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,350
yeah but i want to pop all the left
nodes in the same level at once right

178
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
nodes in the same level at once right
 

179
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,390
nodes in the same level at once right
so how many nodes in the layer in the

180
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
so how many nodes in the layer in the
 

181
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,070
so how many nodes in the layer in the
in the same level in the next level how

182
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
in the same level in the next level how
 

183
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,070
in the same level in the next level how
many nodes for the first

184
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
many nodes for the first
 

185
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,910
many nodes for the first
level yeah well s z equals what

186
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
level yeah well s z equals what
 

187
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,390
level yeah well s z equals what
yeah but how can i get the number of nan

188
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
yeah but how can i get the number of nan
 

189
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,850
yeah but how can i get the number of nan
nodes in the queue

190
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:20,860
nodes in the queue
 

191
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,430

194
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
yeah how many what's the function the
 

195
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,280
yeah how many what's the function the
the thing is

196
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,290
the thing is
 

197
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,150
the thing is
[Music]

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160

 

199
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,830

and then these notes i want to pop these

200
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
and then these notes i want to pop these
 

201
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,790
and then these notes i want to pop these
number of notes right but here i have i

202
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
number of notes right but here i have i
 

203
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,430
number of notes right but here i have i
will have an

204
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
will have an
 

205
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,350
will have an
answer answer at the beginning you'll be

206
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
answer answer at the beginning you'll be
 

207
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,670
answer answer at the beginning you'll be
long right this is the

208
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
long right this is the
 

209
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,749
long right this is the
let's say answer is the first note of

210
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
let's say answer is the first note of
 

211
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,270
let's say answer is the first note of
the

212
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
the
 

213
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,990
the
first note of these level okay and then

214
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
first note of these level okay and then
 

215
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,430
first note of these level okay and then
when we update it

216
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
when we update it
 

217
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,629
when we update it
and you'll be the one we exit the

218
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
and you'll be the one we exit the
 

219
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,550
and you'll be the one we exit the
function actually breakfast such it will

220
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
function actually breakfast such it will
 

221
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,790
function actually breakfast such it will
be the first note of the which row

222
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800

 

223
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,790

of which row this this answer is the

224
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
of which row this this answer is the
 

225
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,189
of which row this this answer is the
let's say it stores the first note of

226
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
let's say it stores the first note of
 

227
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,830
let's say it stores the first note of
the level whenever and if i exit this

228
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
the level whenever and if i exit this
 

229
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,469
the level whenever and if i exit this
while loop

230
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
while loop
 

231
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,629
while loop
and which first node it will be

232
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639

 

233
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,990

okay so now i need to do what four

234
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
okay so now i need to do what four
 

235
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,070
okay so now i need to do what four
and then and here answer equals

236
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
and then and here answer equals
 

237
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,870
and then and here answer equals
equals one

238
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880

 

239
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,830

yeah and then i need to pop these number

240
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
yeah and then i need to pop these number
 

241
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,310
yeah and then i need to pop these number
of notes yeah so four

242
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
of notes yeah so four
 

243
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,469
of notes yeah so four

245
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,990

right zero what which number how many

246
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
right zero what which number how many
 

247
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,510
right zero what which number how many
number of nodes we need to pop

248
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
number of nodes we need to pop
 

249
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,710
number of nodes we need to pop
up when we all the length is

250
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720

and then if if

254
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
and then if if
 

255
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,909
and then if if
and then look then we need to probably

256
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
and then look then we need to probably
 

257
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,430
and then look then we need to probably

yeah so we check the left note and

282
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:52,880
yeah so we check the left note and
 

283
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,070
yeah so we check the left note and
right now yeah yeah you
