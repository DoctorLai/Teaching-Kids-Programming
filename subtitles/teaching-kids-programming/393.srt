1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,560
go

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,120
hello mr mr ryan are you right

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,760
yeah we talked about a game series this

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,480
field that we talked about min max

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,880
max we talked about lego maps no no no

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,880
and we talked about other better pruning

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,880
yesterday

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,520
is basically this improvement of the

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,920
mean max max what's mean max it's a what

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,920
what's it what what about it the mean

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
max

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,960
you know

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,120
mean max yeah something on game three

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,000
yeah game three so for example this

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,079
player as a point of this player's view

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,239
is he's trying to maximize it for

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,079
example yeah maximize it

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,320
and then the other player takes them

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,559
this is two players years zero sum game

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,000
and he's trying to minimize it yeah for

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,160
example this is

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,879
10 a

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,799
11 and then if we we are minimizing at

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,880
this level so this will be eight and

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,799
then if this is the

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,720
six three four

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,799
if you're trying to minimize it there

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,320
will be three and then we and here we

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,520
are trying to maximize it there will be

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
a right

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,920
yeah

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,840
remember this

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,560
yeah and we talked about talk about

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,320
alpha beta what's alphabet happening

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,320
just a little bit um

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,439
review okay what's offered better to me

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,720
so what's the special what's the special

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,720
about alpha pedophilia

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,040
oh look

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,640
three even

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,280
so we are trying to

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,840
maximize five here yeah

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,000
this is maximized

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,000
and then

45
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,320
okay

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,840
okay so what's the value of here what's

47
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,840
the value of it

48
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,640
this is try to minimize it

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,360
yeah why why is that can anybody tell me

50
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,520
it's because yeah using if you use your

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,160
brain

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,560
why why why we don't need to calculate

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,080
these the values in this because we see

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,760
a six we say six so what's what's what's

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,040
this value this x here is what

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,000
x here is must be six or over x is

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,120
bigger than six over if this is six or

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,519
over and we're trying to get a minimum

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,800
five is the winner here so we don't care

60
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,319
anything

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,519
we don't care the values here right

62
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,440
because it's

63
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,920
uninteresting

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,360
it's uninteresting to us

65
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,319
make sense yeah

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,920
look this could be a huge sub tree here

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,760
and at this point because we're

68
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,800
evaluating the tree from that to the

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,280
right and we find the value six here

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,360
then we ask ourselves do we need to

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,840
continue searching here no why is that

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,760
because if this is 6

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,800
the parent value is trying to maximize

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,280
so these values must be 6 or over

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,760
if it is this value is 6 over and then

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,959
this value is trying to minimize this we

77
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,280
have a better value which is five

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,280
no matter what values here

79
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,319
these is six or over and then this will

80
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,959
be five okay this is alpha better

81
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,959
pruning right

82
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,680
so you will help us to

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,400
speed up the

84
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,879
the search yeah search on the trees okay

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,680
okay so let's uh go back to this min max

86
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,159
thing

87
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,080
so me maxine so

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,879
let me just quickly write write the

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,319
implementation of min max okay

90
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,680
define

91
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,799
mean

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,879
max so we have a

93
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,159
current state

94
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,280
we have a

95
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,680
dash and we have a turn okay so

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,760
sometimes we call it color okay turn

97
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,400
player whatever so

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,239
let's just try to uh maybe we can say

99
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,959
maximize it yeah

100
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,599
so this is basically a boolean value

101
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,600
here this is a pudding value

102
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,479
yeah indicating

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,840
if we are trying to maximize or minimize

104
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,080
the color

105
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,320
blue or red

106
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,720
or a player

107
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,720
agent or a poland okay so they're

108
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,759
playing against each other so this this

109
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,759
value boolean value is used to indicate

110
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:40,160
whether we are trying to maximize or

111
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,160
minimize in this case and these steps

112
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,560
we don't actually need to provide these

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,040
steps here but we are given we we

114
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,240
provide a depth value so that we don't

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,199
we can terminate earlier right so so if

116
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,440
we don't provide these steps then that

117
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,720
only the leaf nodes of the different you

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,520
know the kimchi might be so deep right

119
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,759
yeah

120
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,400
if you're playing a chest usually how

121
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,440
many moves before a checkmate

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
one

123
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,919
no no

124
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,720
for the tick tock tic-tac-toe yeah

125
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,080
how many moves

126
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
to

127
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,840
for for you know for a game of the

128
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,440
tic-tac-toe to be fully ended

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,639
usually

130
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,320
it needs to be

131
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,880
yeah i know but how many moves how many

132
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,720
turns the test how many times three

133
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,680
why is this three no six

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,000
six

135
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,320
what i'm asking is that in you know the

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,400
thickness of country

137
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,120
now listen up listen to the question

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,840
carefully this is country yeah this is

139
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,240
the loot yellow definitely zero

140
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,080
and then if i make a cross here yeah i

141
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,479
might make a cross

142
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,680
so i put it here and then the other

143
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,880
player

144
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,520
put a

145
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,919
circle here

146
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,960
yeah so usually how many moves before

147
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,960
this game is ended

148
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,639
yeah

149
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,280
if two players played

150
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,100
smartly intelligently

151
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,960
you're not a draw

152
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,440
[Music]

153
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,759
nine yes nine yeah because look this

154
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,840
game is so small and then if each player

155
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,319
each each player

156
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,280
is smart enough does not make stupid

157
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,280
mistakes and then the depth will be nine

158
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,440
right this is what i mean the depth will

159
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,880
be nice but for a chest

160
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,840
for a chest

161
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,759
maybe 30 moons smoke 40 or more and the

162
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,840
depths would be huge

163
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,759
considering branching factor you know

164
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,639
branching factor the branching factor

165
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,240
here is nine it's basically the maximum

166
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,240
number of kids for a state right because

167
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,840
i'm standing at the root

168
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,440
and i have uh

169
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,400
nine

170
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,520
kids

171
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000
right

172
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,639
i have nine kids why is that if i'm at a

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,039
loser i have nine kids

174
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,759
because i have night choice to press the

175
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,759
to to put the cloth

176
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,840
make sense this is called branching

177
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,160
factor okay so if the branching factor

178
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,080
you're considering if the depth is huge

179
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,080
then the the search tree the search

180
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,000
space would be huge that's why we put a

181
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,960
depth limit that's

182
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,160
so for example if like let's say we we

183
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,160
only consider the steps up to maybe five

184
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,800
or six right

185
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,800
so one way you can put you can call this

186
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,280
function with the zero and then you

187
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,800
increase up to a maximum test which is

188
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,960
maybe six let me terminate or you can

189
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,120
you can give a value of six and any

190
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,440
decrement until zero then you you

191
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,160
evaluate it okay so let's know what the

192
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,160
depth is for okay

193
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
okay so now

194
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,680
at the beginning we just need to

195
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,240
evaluate it so we can say okay let's say

196
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,160
we keep a value from the positive depth

197
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,840
so if that's

198
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,319
equal equal to zero right

199
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,599
or the state is end state so its end

200
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,680
state

201
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,759
is end state

202
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,800
then with return

203
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,280
return

204
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,280
the value evaluate the score of the

205
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,400
i i want to put the equity here utility

206
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,960
function here but the utility function

207
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,400
only applies to unstate so let's change

208
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,280
it to return

209
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,400
the value evaluate score

210
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,400
of the state okay

211
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,520
okay right this is a

212
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,839
look if we are maximizing it

213
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,719
if this time this player is trying to

214
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,360
maximize then i have a score

215
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,120
which at the beginning i put it to minus

216
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,760
infinity okay

217
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,760
minus infinity and then i can say

218
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,640
for action

219
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,920
in action

220
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,640
action state okay action space so so the

221
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,360
action is like the kids of the state of

222
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,440
the

223
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,360
current node okay sometimes we call it

224
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,480
node and then you should be kids

225
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,880
children

226
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,200
right and then then score

227
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,600
will be equals the maximum we are trying

228
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,880
to maximize my score

229
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,680
and then we call this min max function

230
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,839
we met function state the new state

231
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,000
let's say we have a new state so that

232
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,880
would be the action new state

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,160
so that will be successor

234
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,080
of the action of the state

235
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,080
and the new uh

236
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,320
action

237
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,640
the depths will be let's say that will

238
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,680
be minus one right

239
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,680
and then maximizing if we are maximizing

240
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,279
it now the next turn will be minimizing

241
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,680
it okay simple final returns go

242
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,000
okay this is maximum and then we

243
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,160
minimizing is similar

244
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,920
so instead of

245
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,000
instead of

246
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,600
negative infinity

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,399
here is the positive infinity come on

248
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,640
and then for action

249
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,240
in

250
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,720
action

251
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,320
yeah this is the same come on can you

252
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,920
can you

253
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
can you see this part can you understand

254
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,279
this part come on

255
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,920
score

256
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,959
equals minimize okay we are trying we

257
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,519
are at now minimizing it right

258
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,760
mean max

259
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,760
and then this will be the same success

260
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,920
state

261
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,320
action

262
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,399
steps minus one

263
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,800
and look

264
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,440
we are minimizing it so the next turn

265
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,959
will be maximizing it okay so next time

266
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,320
i i need to put uh past the true here

267
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,320
right and then return score

268
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,200
okay

269
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,200
look this is the main max

270
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,120
midnight maximizing minimizing these two

271
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,800
parts

272
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,120
quite similar yeah

273
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,440
the only difference is what the score if

274
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,440
we are maximizing the initial score is

275
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,480
negative infinity if you are trying to

276
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,920
maximize it uh trying to minimize the

277
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,240
initial score is

278
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,160
maximum infinity yeah

279
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
make sense

280
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,000
right

281
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,720
and then

282
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,720
i mean that that's uh

283
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,040
can we improve this dude

284
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,120
one one problem of this implementation

285
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,519
can you pick a problem of this

286
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,200
implementation

287
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,519
what i'm saying is there anything you

288
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,920
don't like about this approach

289
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,920
anything

290
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,440
is there anything you don't like this

291
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,959
about this implementation i mean this

292
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
works but

293
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,200
come on be picky

294
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,440
which part you don't like it looks kinda

295
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,839
[Music]

296
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,920
looks kind of worse

297
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,680
yeah it's slow yeah yeah it's slow

298
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,279
obviously because we have you learn the

299
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,360
alpha beta pruning yeah that's a very

300
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,760
good point but what i'm saying is this

301
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,000
consider this and this

302
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
um

303
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,000
that's a lot of writing why is there a

304
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,920
lot of writing

305
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,160
you're quite close to the answer what i

306
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,760
want because

307
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,399
there is a list

308
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,720
because you have yeah

309
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,040
because you i

310
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
write

311
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,040
the same thing but the opposite again

312
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,920
well done okay that's exactly what

313
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,360
we are looking for similar thing the

314
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,440
same thing but the opposite yeah

315
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,240
this is kind of awkward right it's not

316
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,639
very simplified right it's kind of

317
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,120
you know tedious because these two

318
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,120
is similar it's just

319
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,880
as a different player this one this

320
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,200
player is trying to maximize it's trying

321
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,480
to minimize and we have to write two

322
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,880
parts yeah at least these two block of

323
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,240
code looks quite similar the logic

324
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,079
question you know everyone is trying to

325
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
make money i don't know right okay can

326
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,720
we

327
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,800
so today we're going to talk about

328
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,600
another approach which is called necroma

329
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,120
max megamax

330
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,240
megamax

331
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,760
to simplify these two branch okay

332
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,040
so what does it mean okay so look at

333
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,519
this

334
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,480
i if there are two values a and b

335
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,480
right

336
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,120
i want to get the two

337
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,800
the maximum of this value a and b come

338
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,360
on look at me look at here okay

339
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,560
yeah a and b two values i want to get a

340
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,800
maximum

341
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,720
it's equal to look to me minimize look i

342
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,720
put some negative sign here

343
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,200
minus a

344
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,200
minus b

345
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,639
[Music]

346
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,279
can we give an example like a equals 50

347
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,680
b equals 100 so what's this an answer

348
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,279
which is maximum

349
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,399
100 right

350
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,079
so it equals minus mean

351
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,000
minus 50

352
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,639
minus 100

353
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,399
so which one is smaller minus 50 or

354
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,320
minus 100

355
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,639
minus 100

356
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,360
my minus 100 and i put a sign minus

357
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,720
minus 100 which is 100.

358
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,360
okay this is the same thing okay

359
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,160
we can prove this more

360
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,120
you know

361
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,880
more precisely why is that look if a is

362
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,639
bigger than b

363
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,839
okay because look a max a and b if i say

364
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,920
a is bigger or equal than b okay so max

365
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,600
a b equals a

366
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,720
right now

367
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,920
if a is bigger than b if i put the

368
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,240
negative sign so minus a is smaller or

369
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,600
equal minus b right

370
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
yeah

371
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,680
yeah all right

372
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,240
so minus a is smaller than minus b i

373
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,480
want to get a minimum so it's minus a so

374
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,120
actually this one is minus a so i put

375
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,199
another a minus that would be

376
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,880
you know that will cancel out so you'll

377
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,480
be a it's the same thing so we just

378
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,660
prove it okay

379
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,040
so if look

380
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,040
[Music]

381
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,880
based on this then we can change this

382
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,480
how do we change this first of all let's

383
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,040
change the function okay

384
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,040
we have a color

385
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,480
megamax

386
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,120
okay

387
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,199
so stay we keep it that's we keep it

388
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,880
maximizing it

389
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,680
maximizing it we need to keep it

390
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,920
so we need to keep this maximizing it

391
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,759
maybe we do

392
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,399
okay so

393
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,040
this is the same yeah x equals zero or x

394
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,560
n is zero so we don't we don't need to

395
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,600
draw this

396
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,639
right but we keep this we can erase this

397
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,279
bit okay look we can erase this bit

398
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,199
so at the beginning score is

399
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,199
negative infinity and at least it's the

400
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,199
same now

401
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,600
now look

402
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,639
mega max mega max here

403
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,040
so

404
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,639
i just have to do what i just have to

405
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,480
put a sign here right put the sign

406
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,560
and that will be

407
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,440
that that will be it

408
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,839
yeah a little bit yeah do you understand

409
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,839
yeah

410
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,040
do you understand i think that will be

411
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,040
yeah

412
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,320
what did i just do

413
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,320
what did i just do eric

414
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,320
yes

415
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,639
what changes do i make to bring to uh

416
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:50,279
to make the min max into neck max

417
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,279
look it's simplified

418
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,839
yeah i just look as far as this snake as

419
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,000
this megamax is trying to maximize the

420
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,679
value right only the only difference is

421
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,559
that when i pass

422
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,880
when when i pass it to the next player i

423
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,959
put the sign negative

424
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,400
i put the side negative and not a lot of

425
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,480
b yeah

426
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,720
why is that as i said

427
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,280
if i want to max my a and b

428
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,360
this is the same thing as what if i put

429
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,320
us put a negative sign right yeah

430
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,880
yeah

431
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,240
so you'll be uh you'll be a lot simpler

432
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,480
right you'll be a lot simpler right

433
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,240
yeah which because now this one is

434
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,120
trying to maximize and then the other

435
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,919
one is trying to minimize as the other

436
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,400
player's point of view the the higher

437
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,200
value of this current score

438
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
yeah

439
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,360
is lower but it's it's lower it's it's

440
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,960
look

441
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,679
this is a

442
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,360
this is a line right okay so the higher

443
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,480
of this a okay if this a goes to the

444
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,360
right the higher value

445
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,520
is

446
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,760
further away from

447
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,760
from the other player right makes sense

448
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,840
look because this is two player takes

449
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,919
them right if if as uh the first player

450
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,559
the first player is trying to maximize

451
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,600
it so the first player is asian right

452
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,080
the higher value if i don't the score

453
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,400
is is goes to the right it's more

454
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,360
preferable for the agent

455
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,640
if it's more preferable to the agent

456
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,840
then

457
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,000
you'll be

458
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,600
less preferable for the

459
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,080
for the opponent right

460
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,799
but the thing is that this function is

461
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,280
all is always trying to maximize it so

462
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,640
how can i do this if it's next

463
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,679
so it's more higher then i put a sign

464
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,400
and as the other player's point of view

465
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,880
it's the same they do get it so this

466
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,760
function deals both cases

467
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,039
right

468
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:07,039
the higher value the better

469
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,840
yeah the higher value of the better

470
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,320
previously the min max

471
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,799
function the agent

472
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,880
agent trying to maximize

473
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,120
opponent trying to minimize

474
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,760
but now if i put a sign

475
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,520
so both players trying to maximize

476
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,679
but how how does that work why why is

477
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,960
that because because when i pass it to

478
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,400
the next one

479
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,840
a hundred will become minus 100 right

480
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,640
yeah i 100 is good for me it's bad for

481
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,559
you

482
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,280
because i put the sum minus and you

483
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,400
become minus 100.

484
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,720
right do you see this point i put a i

485
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,280
just put a negative sign this these here

486
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,960
i love it this one is trying to

487
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,840
trying to handle both cases okay

488
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,840
yeah and we

489
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,039
okay so can you tell me what's the steps

490
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,720
function test equals you know equals

491
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,480
what does it mean

492
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,080
what's this test

493
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,910
yes

494
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,119
why do we need this

495
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,119
[Music]

496
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,000
if we

497
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,200
if it's like

498
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,840
over

499
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,840
yeah over

500
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,559
it's a death limit that's limited

501
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,880
remember

502
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,320
this uh this third tree

503
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,120
i need to

504
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,799
go around the limited section yeah yeah

505
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,080
look i don't care what happens because

506
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,760
this tree might be huge yeah you go more

507
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,960
and more and more and there are lots of

508
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,760
to to do here but all i can do all with

509
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,960
my computer computational resources all

510
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,600
i can do is to search for the maximum

511
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,799
depth of four five six or whatever and i

512
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,799
