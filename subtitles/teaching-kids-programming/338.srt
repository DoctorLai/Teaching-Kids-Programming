1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,160
hello

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,000
hello mr ariel are you all right

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,800
yeah yeah yeah okay so we're talking

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,519
about continuous increasing digits okay

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,759
for numbers like this one two

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,680
three you know single digit 12

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,800
23

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,720
34 you see so each number

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,560
okay each digit in the number is one

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,560
plus its previous one so like uh

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,199
678 that's good but not this one is not

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,960
right this one's not okay

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,920
can you do like

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,920
can you do like 910

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,520
very good question no

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,480
yeah yeah i know well let's that's a

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,160
very good question okay about

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,239
unfunctioning no we don't count that we

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,719
only count the digit okay but this is a

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,360
very nice point and also for the number

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,199
zero we don't consider it

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,120
continuous increasing region okay let's

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,520
just call let

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,320
let's just define it as a positive

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,720
number positive integer positive integer

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,000
x bigger than zero okay

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,960
where each digit of x is one plus each

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
digit okay each single digit is one plus

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,240
this previous one

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,240
okay

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,680
so

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,159
what's the

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,040
what's how many of nums uh how many of

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,759
these kind of numbers within the uh from

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,759
zero to from zero to a hundred okay but

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,040
we're saying we don't need to consider

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,159
zero so let's say from one to a hundred

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,439
last time

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:41,000
account is seventeen seventeen okay so

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,000
can you count it again

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:49,439
so one two three four five six seven

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,000
eight nine yeah single digit two digit

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,840
now 12

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,720
uh

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,520
23

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,520
and 34

47
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,040
45

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,520
56

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,880
67 78

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,680
89

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,080
okay yeah that's where

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,080
nine

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,280
ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,680
fifteen sixteen seventeen weather okay

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,720
okay so how can we do this uh if we want

56
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,200
to

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,520
find out the all the numbers within the

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,879
range within the range s

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,239
from s to e inclusive okay from s to e

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,400
inclusion

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,400
so what's your approach how can we solve

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,560
this kind of problem how many ways can

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,840
you solve it

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,840
any idea

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,160
it depends on how you prove us yeah the

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,640
most stupid way of proof of thing is try

67
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,360
every single number between s and e and

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,360
then checking each number if it's you

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,599
know if you satisfy this right but it

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,680
could take long time right yeah yeah why

71
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,840
is that because look if the s and e if

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,239
the difference between s and is quite

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,400
big then you have to

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,200
you have to check quite a lot of cases

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,440
right so that that's very bad right

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,879
okay so for the proof of thing and

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,560
stefan search

78
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,959
when we talk about the buffer session

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,720
proofworking we are talking about what

80
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,720
what what we are talking about what kind

81
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,400
of problem

82
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,120
[Music]

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,879
uh

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
here is the tree

85
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,519
or

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,400
graph yes graph so let's say if this

87
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,440
number is one so what's the next one

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,440
what's the next note

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,519
what's one what's next

90
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,519
two okay so it's 12. okay what's next

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,959
no no one okay look each digit this is

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,879
the first digit okay and then

93
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,280
first

94
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,159
yeah yeah yeah you see are not easy so

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,519
so

96
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,159
how many possibilities are first digits

97
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,560
how many possibilities

98
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,239
how how many if one would pick the digit

99
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,840
let's start from picking the first digit

100
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,239
how many choices do we have for the

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,959
picking nine nine choice yeah so we can

102
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,680
have these two and three three it says a

103
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,040
tier nine right actually nine there's no

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
no

105
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,479
uh no edges coming off online right

106
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,560
because it's nine

107
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,240
eight there's only one choice which is

108
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,960
89 okay

109
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,840
yeah and the vertex each vertex is the

110
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,320
number right so so we can for let's say

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,919
from breakfast search we can push

112
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,160
remember a few days ago we talked about

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,479
multi-source preferences we can push all

114
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,280
these initial the first digit into the

115
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,680
queue

116
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,479
into the cube so we have these one two

117
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,800
three four five tier nine right and now

118
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,080
we take one number look let's say take

119
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,639
one number

120
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,400
one i take it one i

121
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,240
first of all i take it out and i check

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
if it's within this range if it's with

123
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,919
this range then i point it to the result

124
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,720
and i append the kit yeah i turn the key

125
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,600
which is one two back to account okay so

126
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,520
look if this range is 10 up to 10 do we

127
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,880
have still have to push

128
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,840
uh actually no if this noise is

129
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,400
then let's say okay if i take the 1 12

130
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,479
out okay i want to push the next kid is

131
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,479
123 right

132
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,639
but look at this upper end if it is up

133
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,600
to 10 do i need to push this number

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,320
again

135
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,759
no

136
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,120
why is that

137
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,960
because

138
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,199
it's

139
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,960
12 is already bigger

140
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,880
so there's no point appending because

141
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,400
it's still bigger right

142
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,479
yeah okay

143
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,680
so make sense okay let's just quickly

144
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,080
implement a breakfast search

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,039
multi-source breakfast search

146
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,600
research

147
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,039
uh what kind of data structure are we

148
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,880
using

149
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,280
can we use to implement a breakfast

150
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,320
search

151
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,600
define

152
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,720
key

153
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
find

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,919
numbers yeah we're done and then python

155
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,919
what's the queue

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,479
okay let's say answer is a list

157
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,479
pl is a dq

158
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,080
dq offers the constant term in appending

159
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,960
and push uh popping in both sides

160
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,479
constant time if we're using a list the

161
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,919
up the pop left yeah prop zero is linear

162
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,080
it's not constant that's why we use the

163
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,199
dequeue by the way so at the beginning

164
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,280
we want to follow i in range one we want

165
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,680
to push the first digit so what should i

166
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,440
do here

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,440
fine wrench

168
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,440
591

169
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,000
well i don't don't look at my notes

170
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,730
before i learn to walk

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,720
there

172
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,840
[Music]

173
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,720
so one two the second parameter is one

174
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,720
ten ten yeah and then q dot append

175
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,759
i okay

176
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,199
and then y

177
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,160
q

178
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,759
we take a number c equals q dot problem

179
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,680
right

180
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,120
and now we want to find out if it's the

181
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,000
range right s smaller than e

182
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,720
smaller than c smaller than e

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,039
then we took answer dot dot one how do

184
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,919
we append it we just apparent yeah okay

185
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,960
okay okay so answer the opportunity you

186
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,759
can write it as this answer plus equal c

187
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,400
yeah we talked about that before okay or

188
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,039
alternatively you can write this answer

189
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,199
plus equal parenthesis look parentheses

190
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,880
c comma

191
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,720
this means that's the tuple okay it's

192
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,479
the same so you can put the table put

193
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,880
the content of the topper

194
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,599
into the list okay this is also okay

195
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,039
that looks weird weird okay so why what

196
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,599
is a comma okay it's very strange

197
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,879
because this this is like a number right

198
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,879
but this is a topper

199
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,960
a couple with only single element that's

200
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,919
like let's that's why we put the cup

201
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,400
comma yeah come on how do you call this

202
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,280
coma comma comma in

203
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,560
just

204
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,479
to say this is a tupper

205
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,479
not a number right

206
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,280
okay now look if

207
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,479
c

208
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,120
is p if c is smaller than e right if

209
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,599
it's still in the range then i can queue

210
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,000
uh okay so if this number is c what's

211
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,000
this the rightmost digit what's the

212
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,960
digit at once for example one two three

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,360
what's this number um

214
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,160
okay so let's say air equals c modulus

215
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,680
10

216
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,360
and then i want to append the next

217
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,120
number which is what

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,360
in a q

219
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,680
look this is one two three and what's

220
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,719
next is one two three four

221
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,719
yeah

222
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,959
so i need to how can i get this number

223
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,200
from this number i need to multiply this

224
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,160
by

225
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,440
[Music]

226
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,800
1 10 10 and plus these number

227
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
plus one right

228
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,160
so this is c times 10

229
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,040
plus l plus one right

230
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,560
okay

231
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,930
yeah

232
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,360
and then return

233
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,000
[Music]

234
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,200
answer okay there's one problem here

235
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,120
which is if if the last stitch is nine

236
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,839
do we have to append it

237
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,519
no yeah because if last is in nine let's

238
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,290
say stop

239
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,839
yeah so we have to say if you can say

240
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:24,399
[Music]

241
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,120
910 not equals right nine then we can

242
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,160
open yeah okay okay that's the pressure

243
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,839
search

244
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,000
okay and then let's try the definition

245
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,839
okay it should be very easy okay and so

246
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,120
we keep this under but instead of q we

247
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,519
use the recursion on the stack right we

248
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,440
ask the computer to to

249
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,800
maintain a stack for us that's why we

250
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
use the recursion

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,839
so define

252
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,279
default search and we let's say the

253
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,519
current number is

254
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,640
is c okay

255
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,519
if

256
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,640
c

257
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,640
is bigger than s smaller than e then we

258
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,040
append it yeah we append this number

259
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,720
okay uh append

260
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,920
open apparently okay okay

261
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,800
yeah

262
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,800
uh okay because this answer is is

263
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,279
is non-local to this function we have to

264
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,320
declare non-local answer

265
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,079
now look

266
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,600
if

267
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,680
if c is bigger than the upper bound

268
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,519
right if c is bigger than upper bar and

269
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,240
i i just don't need to continue return

270
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,000
right make sense yeah

271
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,040
yeah and then i need i need to the last

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,920
digit is what uh c modulus 10 right

273
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,000
and what's the next number i can say

274
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,320
that's what's that if if

275
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,920
if air not this is the same as not

276
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,959
equals 9 then i can definitely search

277
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,399
c

278
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,720
times 10

279
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,240
plus a plus one right let's say it's

280
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,720
next number right because this is one

281
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,959
two three one two three times ten

282
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
plus three plus one is one two three

283
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,480
four make sense

284
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,560
yeah i know what's next

285
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,240
what's next

286
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,640
so at the beginning what should we do

287
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,800
now so this is the first i know we

288
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,760
should staffordshire's what how many

289
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,160
possibilities for the first digit

290
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,560
so let's say for i

291
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,320
in range

292
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,160
one to ten

293
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,079
and therefore search eye

294
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,519
and then i have this answer because we

295
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,680
can answer

296
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,040
yeah returns all we can sort it answer

297
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,760
if you want to

298
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,279
have increasing from one two three is

299
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,040
increasing make sense

300
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,240
yeah

301
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,720
okay

302
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,839
okay so this is definite search

303
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,079
so do we do we actually know what kind

304
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,959
of i mean

305
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,680
so

306
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,760
do you have actually think about what

307
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,560
how many possibilities are there you

308
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,480
know because we always stop at

309
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,800
is there upper limit for

310
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,160
how many numbers how many kinds of these

311
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,800
numbers are there

312
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,600
so you have to tell me first is it

313
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,639
unlimited or is it there's just a total

314
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,279
number you know we can find it now

315
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:10,160
limited limited why is that limited

316
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:13,360
because um because um

317
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,360
i don't know how to explain

318
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,560
because because um i i think because

319
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
um because um

320
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,040
because they're not

321
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,600
really a lot of numbers

322
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,279
okay because every time you

323
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,200
no matter what kind of number you pick

324
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,200
you always end at which number

325
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,639
no matter which digit you pick you

326
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,880
always the last digit always the maximum

327
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,360
you can go is what which number nine

328
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,200
that's it yeah so let's limit it right

329
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,360
so let's say

330
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,360
if it's limited what does the mean the

331
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,800
previous the if their previous the

332
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,040
different search preferences what's the

333
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,040
tango minecraft if it's a limited scope

334
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,760
how how many yeah look

335
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,200
it's constant time right because they're

336
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,160
only limited right it's constant

337
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,160
make sense no matter the star and end

338
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,720
the the given inputs

339
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,920
there's only the limited number of these

340
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
numbers

341
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,480
i give you one example okay so can you

342
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,760
give me the number start with one

343
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,600
yeah one one two one two three one two

344
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,360
three four one two three okay and then

345
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,440
here one two three four five six seven

346
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,079
eight nine yeah one two three four five

347
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,880
six seven eight nine is the biggest yeah

348
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,240
how many numbers are there uh you did

349
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,680
you just did

350
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,800
how many

351
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,800
how many counts how many

352
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,320
do you have to actually count the last

353
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,720
number is one

354
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
nine yeah okay so start with two how

355
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,680
many

356
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,519
two three

357
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,760
two three four two three five

358
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,800
uh-huh okay so how many

359
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,680
okay

360
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,680
and then three you need to count

361
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,680
seven

362
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,639
five

363
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,880
four three two one one is what nine

364
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,639
right this is what eight

365
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,440
eight nine right

366
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
yeah

367
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,320
makes sense

368
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,920
so how many numbers all together

369
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,920
how many all numbers together

370
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,760
these numbers adding together all right

371
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,839
wow that was quick

372
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,800
yeah how do you know it's 45

373
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,040
because yeah 45 that's only the 45

374
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,800
numbers because what

375
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,959
because how do you get this number one

376
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,480
plus two plus plus nine how do you know

377
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,800
what's the sum what's the sum of the

378
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,519
first and natural number remember we

379
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,959
talk about this sum of the first n

380
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,680
numbers

381
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,120
yeah sum of the first n so let's say sum

382
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,000
n

383
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,240
yeah

384
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,360
i equals 1 to

385
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,480
n sum i okay so my

386
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,040
that equals one the last number plus the

387
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,600
first number times how many numbers are

388
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,720
there divided by two so if we plug in

389
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,959
the nine

390
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,240
so the number will be what nine plus one

391
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,639
times nine

392
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,279
divided by 2 that's 45

393
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:20,079
if we plug in 100 what's the number 1

394
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:23,839
plus 2 plus 200 100 350. yeah 100 plus 1

395
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:27,360
times 100 divided by 2 that is 50 50.

396
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:31,199
you see that's the equation yeah first n

397
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,240
integer start from one n plus one

398
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:37,680
times n divided by two okay

399
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,720
okay so let's so we have only 45 numbers

400
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,440
here

401
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,759
right so we have only one 45 numbers so

402
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,519
we can actually

403
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,360
we can actually do this

404
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,480
yeah because there

405
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,519
we can actually do this

406
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,600
look we can actually do uh this s equals

407
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,600
one two let's ignore the zero right

408
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,600
and we can do this we can start with

409
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,440
each number and then we can try the blue

410
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,959
four thing to all the digits on the

411
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,880
right right

412
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,440
yeah and we can find if it's the range

413
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,920
so we can do this answer equal that's a

414
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,800
string and that's a string for

415
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
i

416
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,759
in

417
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,959
range

418
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,959
render length

419
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,959
so let's start with the index index is

420
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,120
what zero

421
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,759
zero to

422
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,839
uh to ten right to ten

423
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,680
yeah to ten so let's start with and then

424
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,160
what's the

425
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,240
let's start from the left i with the

426
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,920
left index and the right index will be

427
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,600
for j in

428
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,399
range

429
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,680
i

430
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,959
plus 1 right i plus 1 to 10

431
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,680
and this number is 1 is s

432
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,399
i to j right right to j

433
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,680
and we convert it to integer

434
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,199
if

435
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,400
s smaller equal e uh c is similar equal

436
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,679
e then we can just answer the open

437
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,520
append

438
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,439
c

439
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,360
okay

440
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,079
then we can just do this and then return

441
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,079
sorting answer

442
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,120
something

443
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,919
because look because uh if you know if

444
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,400
you we don't provide this sort it could

445
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,640
be out of out of order right out of

446
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,640
other

447
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,919
for i in range actually is nine okay

448
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,760
it's not ten because there are only nine

449
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,960
numbers here so that let's

450
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,440
that's nine

451
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,480
the index will be from zero to eight

452
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,960
this i is the left index so

453
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,720
if i is the index for the left for

454
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,600
example if i equals 0 1 2 3 here

455
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,600
right

456
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,120
and then j will be

457
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,679
the index from i plus 1 to the n right

458
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,600
so there will be 4 45

459
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,919
456

460
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,320
yeah this kind of thing and then c

461
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,160
will be converted from a string to the

462
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
integer and we check if it's in a range

463
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,280
then if it's no in the range then we

464
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,440
append it right what's the time

465
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,799
complexity for this one

466
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,039
what's the time frame let's do one for

467
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,039
this

468
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,239
[Music]

469
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,679
there are nine iterations here

470
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,600
and one a one and they are at most right

471
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,400
you can say it's almost nine iterations

472
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,799
so

473
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,799
they are

474
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,840
clear at most here

475
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,840
as we said look 45

476
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:48,720
45 so it's actually a 0 45 so which is

477
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,440
why because no matter it doesn't this

478
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,480
aggregate doesn't depend on sne right

479
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,360
look

480
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,200
look

481
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,799
these two

482
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,760
are determined

483
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,200
these two are fixed no matter the value

484
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,799
s or e change

485
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,760
it doesn't change right

486
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,880
yeah

487
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,039
as a minion e a trillion

488
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,480
these these two are not effective are

489
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,760
not very right

490
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,480
am right

491
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,320
okay so only the only thing

492
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,840
makes a difference is this by checking

493
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,000
the range right

494
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,440
right but but this is the loop the

495
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,559
number of times

496
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,400
this loop executed does not depend on

497
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,200
the value of s and e so the time

498
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,559
complexity is of 45 the space complexity

499
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,580
okay we're trying to get a space

500
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,840
complexity

501
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,760
[Music]

502
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,280
how many how many numbers can we store

503
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,240
in these answers

504
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,039
maximum 45 yeah so which is

505
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,600
a one a one yeah right now okay

506
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,160
okay so um to sum up

507
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,880
the previous professor stefan search is

508
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,320
also all one right yeah

509
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,880
yeah you can't find more than that right

510
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,200
because we always stop at number nine

511
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,120
and when we expand the next kit we

512
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,000
always have the plus one at the end

513
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,840
right

514
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,640
yeah the next digit so the search space

515
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,799
so the search space is not it's limited

516
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,000
it's not unbounded okay it's it's

517
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,000
limited it's limited by o45 so all the

518
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,200
time implementation we'll talk about

519
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,240
today is

520
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,200
is a one constant term and

521
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,360
constant space

522
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:29,400
any questions so far

523
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,400
okay bye bye bye bye bye okay
