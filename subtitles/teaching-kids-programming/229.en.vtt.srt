00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,390

hello hello mr eric are you all right

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
hello hello mr eric are you all right
 

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,030
hello hello mr eric are you all right
yes okay so today we talked about flip

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,040
yes okay so today we talked about flip
 

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,909
yes okay so today we talked about flip
zero

6
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:07,919
zero
 

7
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,709
zero
three zeros what does it mean so we're

8
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:10,719
three zeros what does it mean so we're
 

9
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,789
three zeros what does it mean so we're
given

10
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:12,799
given
 

11
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,910
given
we given a string a list of only zero

12
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:15,920
we given a string a list of only zero
 

13
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,630
we given a string a list of only zero
and ones

14
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
and ones
 

15
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,830
and ones
so one zero zero one zero okay

16
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
so one zero zero one zero okay
 

17
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,630
so one zero zero one zero okay
it only contains zeros and ones so every

18
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
it only contains zeros and ones so every
 

19
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,950
it only contains zeros and ones so every
time we can pick a digit

20
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
time we can pick a digit
 

21
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,029
time we can pick a digit
and then we can flip the digit and

22
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
and then we can flip the digit and
 

23
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,390
and then we can flip the digit and
everything

24
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
everything
 

25
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,550
everything
on the left on the right so when i say

26
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
on the left on the right so when i say
 

27
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,150
on the left on the right so when i say
flip what does it mean

28
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
flip what does it mean
 

29
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,190
flip what does it mean
it's like a coin yeah one is facing up

30
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
it's like a coin yeah one is facing up
 

31
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,510
it's like a coin yeah one is facing up
you

32
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
you
 

33
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,750
you
you flip you're facing down when it when

34
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
you flip you're facing down when it when
 

35
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,030
you flip you're facing down when it when
it's facing down you flip

36
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
it's facing down you flip
 

37
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,069
it's facing down you flip
you will be facing up so flip is one

38
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
you will be facing up so flip is one
 

39
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,190
you will be facing up so flip is one
operation

40
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
operation
 

41
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,549
operation
from one to zero and from zero to one

42
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
from one to zero and from zero to one
 

43
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,590
from one to zero and from zero to one
all right all right yeah

44
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,600
all right all right yeah
 

45
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,670
all right all right yeah
so the value if it's v then it will

46
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
so the value if it's v then it will
 

47
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,270
so the value if it's v then it will
become one minus v

48
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
become one minus v
 

49
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,270
become one minus v
okay okay yeah because if it's zero they

50
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
okay okay yeah because if it's zero they
 

51
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,869
okay okay yeah because if it's zero they
become one if it is one it will become

52
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879
become one if it is one it will become
 

53
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,349
become one if it is one it will become
zero

54
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
zero
 

55
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,869
zero
okay that's three so can you tell me how

56
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
okay that's three so can you tell me how
 

57
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,109
okay that's three so can you tell me how
can i flip these to all zeros

58
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
can i flip these to all zeros
 

59
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,149
can i flip these to all zeros
remember if i flip these one

60
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
remember if i flip these one
 

61
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,630
remember if i flip these one
i need to flip everything on on the left

62
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
i need to flip everything on on the left
 

63
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,990
i need to flip everything on on the left
on the right

64
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000

 

65
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,550

yeah zero and one one zero one yeah

66
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
yeah zero and one one zero one yeah
 

67
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,429
yeah zero and one one zero one yeah
everything on the right

68
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
everything on the right
 

69
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,710
everything on the right
and i flip this one yeah so

70
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
and i flip this one yeah so
 

71
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,990
and i flip this one yeah so
zero zeros and these will be flipped as

72
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
zero zeros and these will be flipped as
 

73
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,030
zero zeros and these will be flipped as
well

74
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
well
 

75
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,350
well
okay and do i need to flip this no

76
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
okay and do i need to flip this no
 

77
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,630
okay and do i need to flip this no
one zero zero zero zero one

78
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
one zero zero zero zero one
 

79
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,030
one zero zero zero zero one
and then zero zero zero zero zero so how

80
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
and then zero zero zero zero zero so how
 

81
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,670
and then zero zero zero zero zero so how
many

82
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
many
 

83
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,670
many
one two three four so you tell me four

84
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
one two three four so you tell me four
 

85
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,710
one two three four so you tell me four
times

86
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
times
 

87
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,350
times
three tell the minimum minimum of course

88
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
three tell the minimum minimum of course
 

89
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,149
three tell the minimum minimum of course
minimum

90
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
minimum
 

91
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,190
minimum
for the maximum you can flip each one a

92
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
for the maximum you can flip each one a
 

93
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,870
for the maximum you can flip each one a
limited number of times

94
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
limited number of times
 

95
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,749
limited number of times
if it's even number of times yeah if you

96
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
if it's even number of times yeah if you
 

97
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,789
if it's even number of times yeah if you
know one if we

98
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
know one if we
 

99
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,670
know one if we
flip 100 times so what happened

100
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
flip 100 times so what happened
 

101
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,030
flip 100 times so what happened
um

102
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040

 

103
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,709

yeah yeah yeah oh if one flip a hundred

104
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
yeah yeah yeah oh if one flip a hundred
 

105
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,310
yeah yeah yeah oh if one flip a hundred
times you become

106
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
times you become
 

107
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,669
times you become
you become a a coin flip

108
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
you become a a coin flip
 

109
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,949
you become a a coin flip
100 times you know flip one if you flip

110
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
100 times you know flip one if you flip
 

111
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,990
100 times you know flip one if you flip
one hundred times what happened you'll

112
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
one hundred times what happened you'll
 

113
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,910
one hundred times what happened you'll
become one yeah you'll fix the same

114
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
become one yeah you'll fix the same
 

115
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,030
become one yeah you'll fix the same
zero flip a hundred times

116
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
zero flip a hundred times
 

117
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,430
zero flip a hundred times
the same yeah zero zero 99 times

118
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
the same yeah zero zero 99 times
 

119
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,830
the same yeah zero zero 99 times
one one seventy three times

120
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840

 

121
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,270

one a minion

122
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
one a minion
 

123
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,869
one a minion
and two times um

124
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
and two times um
 

125
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,949
and two times um
one yeah you got it yeah even number of

126
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
one yeah you got it yeah even number of
 

127
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,710
one yeah you got it yeah even number of
times doesn't change yeah

128
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
times doesn't change yeah
 

129
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,630
times doesn't change yeah
zero all number of times it change it

130
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
zero all number of times it change it
 

131
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,830
zero all number of times it change it
flips okay

132
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
flips okay
 

133
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,430
flips okay
so so what's the strategy

134
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
so so what's the strategy
 

135
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,350
so so what's the strategy
what's the strategy how are we going to

136
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
what's the strategy how are we going to
 

137
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,790
what's the strategy how are we going to
flip it from

138
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
flip it from
 

139
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,830
flip it from
which side which is there because

140
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
which side which is there because
 

141
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,750
which side which is there because
because every time we flip one thing you

142
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
because every time we flip one thing you
 

143
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,229
because every time we flip one thing you
will change everything along the right

144
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
will change everything along the right
 

145
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:08,229
will change everything along the right
are we go to left to right

146
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239

 

147
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,470

okay so so yes what are we doing from

148
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
okay so so yes what are we doing from
 

149
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,309
okay so so yes what are we doing from
left to right because that

150
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
left to right because that
 

151
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,350
left to right because that
if we flip these it doesn't change

152
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
if we flip these it doesn't change
 

153
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,869
if we flip these it doesn't change
everything on the left but change

154
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
everything on the left but change
 

155
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,710
everything on the left but change
everything on the right right

156
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
everything on the right right
 

157
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,350
everything on the right right
so we go through from left to right but

158
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
so we go through from left to right but
 

159
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,990
so we go through from left to right but
when we

160
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
when we
 

161
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,030
when we
we we check the current digit if we

162
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
we we check the current digit if we
 

163
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,390
we we check the current digit if we
zero if it's zero you know

164
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
zero if it's zero you know
 

165
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,030
zero if it's zero you know
we we don't change if it's one we flip

166
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
we we don't change if it's one we flip
 

167
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,710
we we don't change if it's one we flip
it but we also need to remember the

168
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
it but we also need to remember the
 

169
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,509
it but we also need to remember the
current

170
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
current
 

171
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,710
current
flip okay we need to have a counter

172
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
flip okay we need to have a counter
 

173
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,229
flip okay we need to have a counter
because look because l is zero okay

174
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
because look because l is zero okay
 

175
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,830
because look because l is zero okay
let's look at the second zero if

176
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
let's look at the second zero if
 

177
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,630
let's look at the second zero if
we when we check this zero we already be

178
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
we when we check this zero we already be
 

179
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,350
we when we check this zero we already be
zero

180
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
zero
 

181
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,509
zero
no right because we already flipped one

182
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
no right because we already flipped one
 

183
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,390
no right because we already flipped one
times

184
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
times
 

185
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,630
times
in the first digit so when we visit this

186
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
in the first digit so when we visit this
 

187
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,229
in the first digit so when we visit this
zero it's actually one

188
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
zero it's actually one
 

189
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,190
zero it's actually one
right so we need to flip it again right

190
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
right so we need to flip it again right
 

191
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,990
right so we need to flip it again right
all right

192
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
all right
 

193
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,350
all right
so if we flip this one and for the third

194
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
so if we flip this one and for the third
 

195
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,550
so if we flip this one and for the third
third digit

196
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
third digit
 

197
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,270
third digit
do we do we need to flip it no because

198
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
do we do we need to flip it no because
 

199
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,670
do we do we need to flip it no because
look

200
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
look
 

201
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,670
look
after the third digit we are flipping

202
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
after the third digit we are flipping
 

203
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,830
after the third digit we are flipping
two times zero flip two times

204
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
two times zero flip two times
 

205
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,869
two times zero flip two times
is zero so we can skip that digit so in

206
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
is zero so we can skip that digit so in
 

207
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,069
is zero so we can skip that digit so in
you know to sum up like

208
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
you know to sum up like
 

209
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,909
you know to sum up like
when we visit we need to take

210
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
when we visit we need to take
 

211
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,430
when we visit we need to take
consideration of account

212
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
consideration of account
 

213
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,950
consideration of account
which is the flips we have done so far

214
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
which is the flips we have done so far
 

215
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,710
which is the flips we have done so far
from the left to the right right

216
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
from the left to the right right
 

217
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,189
from the left to the right right
and then going this order we can we can

218
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
and then going this order we can we can
 

219
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,430
and then going this order we can we can
do it let's do it it should be very

220
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
do it let's do it it should be very
 

221
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,510
do it let's do it it should be very
straightforward

222
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520

 

223
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,550

i'm sleepy you're sleepy yeah because

224
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
i'm sleepy you're sleepy yeah because
 

225
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,950
i'm sleepy you're sleepy yeah because
it's

226
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
it's
 

227
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,510
it's
too hard for you no and you get too

228
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
too hard for you no and you get too
 

229
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,230
too hard for you no and you get too
sleepy

230
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
sleepy
 

231
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:55,030
sleepy
okay

232
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040

 

233
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,830

what's the numbers yeah numbers nums

234
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
what's the numbers yeah numbers nums
 

235
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,870
what's the numbers yeah numbers nums
okay so that we have this count

236
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
okay so that we have this count
 

237
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,590
okay so that we have this count
count equals zero okay this is the

238
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
count equals zero okay this is the
 

239
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,870
count equals zero okay this is the
number of the

240
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
number of the
 

241
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,670
number of the
flips we have done so far so now we just

242
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
flips we have done so far so now we just
 

243
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:09,990
flips we have done so far so now we just
need

244
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
need
 

245
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,909
need
to go through how how can we go through

246
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
to go through how how can we go through
 

247
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,350
to go through how how can we go through
the numbers

248
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
the numbers
 

249
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,150
the numbers
how can we go through the numbers how

250
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
how can we go through the numbers how
 

251
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,430
how can we go through the numbers how
can we go through the number from the

252
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
can we go through the number from the
 

253
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,110
can we go through the number from the
left to the right four

254
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
left to the right four
 

255
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,150
left to the right four
four one something in range for i

256
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
four one something in range for i
 

257
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,070
four one something in range for i
in numbers all right we can do this

258
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
in numbers all right we can do this
 

259
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,830
in numbers all right we can do this
directly here what side

260
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
directly here what side
 

261
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,070
directly here what side
sorry what side what side what do you

262
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
sorry what side what side what do you
 

263

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
mean what's i
 

265
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,390
mean what's i
i anything a number an index or can we

266
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
i anything a number an index or can we
 

267
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,070
i anything a number an index or can we
call it whatever we want yeah

268
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
call it whatever we want yeah
 

269
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:45,029
call it whatever we want yeah
yeah for n let's say for n okay for

270
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039

 

271
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,150

okay so now if

272
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
okay so now if
 

273
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,510
okay so now if
if n is zero okay

274
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
if n is zero okay
 

275
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,670
if n is zero okay
if n is yellow

276
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680

 

277
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,189

if n is zero but if the cloud

278
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
if n is zero but if the cloud
 

279
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,309
if n is zero but if the cloud
is odd number right

280
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
is odd number right
 

281
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,430
is odd number right
if cloud is all number and

282
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
if cloud is all number and
 

283
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,790
if cloud is all number and
and count is all number let's say count

284
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
and count is all number let's say count
 

285
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,390
and count is all number let's say count
and one is odd number so what happened

286
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
and one is odd number so what happened
 

287
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,590
and one is odd number so what happened
in this case so if

288
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
in this case so if
 

289
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,830
in this case so if
n is zero current is zero but we have

290
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
n is zero current is zero but we have
 

291
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,029
n is zero current is zero but we have
flipped

292
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
flipped
 

293
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,430
flipped
what number of times so do we need to

294
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
what number of times so do we need to
 

295
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,070
what number of times so do we need to
flip it

296
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
flip it
 

297
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,230
flip it
again an old number yeah

298
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
again an old number yeah
 

299
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,749
again an old number yeah
yeah if n is zero current is zero but we

300
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
yeah if n is zero current is zero but we
 

301
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,790
yeah if n is zero current is zero but we
fit all numbers

302
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
fit all numbers
 

303
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,430
fit all numbers
so you become one one and do we need to

304
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
so you become one one and do we need to
 

305
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,710
so you become one one and do we need to
flip it

306
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
flip it
 

307
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,629
flip it
we're going to flip the zero yeah yeah

308
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
we're going to flip the zero yeah yeah
 

309
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,469
we're going to flip the zero yeah yeah
so we want to flip

310
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
so we want to flip
 

311
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,510
so we want to flip
yesterday oh oh what

312
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
yesterday oh oh what
 

313
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,110
yesterday oh oh what
if a is one and can you tell me what to

314
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
if a is one and can you tell me what to
 

315
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,790
if a is one and can you tell me what to
do here count if it's

316
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
do here count if it's
 

317
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,469
do here count if it's
and if it's n equal or equal one

318
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
and if it's n equal or equal one
 

319
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,350
and if it's n equal or equal one
if it's one but we have flipped

320
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360

 

321
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,990

odd number or even number um

322
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
odd number or even number um
 

323
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,150
odd number or even number um
if reflect oh it becomes zero so we

324
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
if reflect oh it becomes zero so we
 

325
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,749
if reflect oh it becomes zero so we
don't want to phrase it so if

326
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
don't want to phrase it so if
 

327
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,870
don't want to phrase it so if
it were what

328
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
it were what
 

329
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,629
it were what
um

330
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639

 

331
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,950

yeah if it's zero it means even number

332
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
yeah if it's zero it means even number
 

333
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,430
yeah if it's zero it means even number
if we count equals if calculated is in

334
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
if we count equals if calculated is in
 

335
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,150
if we count equals if calculated is in
one

336
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
one
 

337
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,350
one
but we flip even number of times so

338
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
but we flip even number of times so
 

339
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,110
but we flip even number of times so
it means still one right i'm right

340
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
it means still one right i'm right
 

341
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,629
it means still one right i'm right
now we want to flip it yeah okay

342
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
now we want to flip it yeah okay
 

343
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:34,309
now we want to flip it yeah okay
now we do what

344
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319

 

345
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,230

we want to flip so what happened to the

346
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
we want to flip so what happened to the
 

347
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,070
we want to flip so what happened to the
car

348
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080

 

349
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,420

yeah and we can

350
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,430
yeah and we can
 

351
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:51,270
yeah and we can

353
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,869

what are we doing here we are counting

354
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
what are we doing here we are counting
 

355
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,309
what are we doing here we are counting
how many what

356
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
how many what
 

357
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:11,510
how many what
counting return what

359
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,390

okay huh that doesn't make sense this is

360
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
okay huh that doesn't make sense this is
 

361
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,670
okay huh that doesn't make sense this is
the number of count we

362
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
the number of count we
 

363
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,790
the number of count we
flip the number of flips so when

364
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
flip the number of flips so when
 

365
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,670
flip the number of flips so when
it's current digit look all right so

366
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
it's current digit look all right so
 

367
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,869
it's current digit look all right so
look at zero

368
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
look at zero
 

369
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,670
look at zero
and we're looking for one and one with 0

370
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
and we're looking for one and one with 0
 

371
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,110
and we're looking for one and one with 0
so what does it mean look

372
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
so what does it mean look
 

373
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,550
so what does it mean look
0 something 1 equals

374
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560

 

375
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,230

1 equals 1 and 1

376
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
1 equals 1 and 1
 

377
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,389
1 equals 1 and 1
0 we're looking for these two cases 0 1

378
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
0 we're looking for these two cases 0 1
 

379
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,149
0 we're looking for these two cases 0 1
1 0. so can you tell me what kind of

380
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
1 0. so can you tell me what kind of
 

381
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,430
1 0. so can you tell me what kind of
operation the pit

382
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
operation the pit
 

383
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,990
operation the pit
operation are we looking for zero one

384
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
operation are we looking for zero one
 

385
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,550
operation are we looking for zero one
one zero if they are different

386
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
one zero if they are different
 

387
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,590
one zero if they are different
what do we call it yeah

388
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
what do we call it yeah
 

389
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,670
what do we call it yeah
exclusive or or to this yes i got

390
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:53,680
exclusive or or to this yes i got
 

391
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,310
exclusive or or to this yes i got
this is symbol of above six so we can

392
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
this is symbol of above six so we can
 

393
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,670
this is symbol of above six so we can
just do this

394
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
just do this
 

395
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,990
just do this
we can just do this this one we can just

396
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
we can just do this this one we can just
 

397
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,790
we can just do this this one we can just
erase it

398
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
erase it
 

399
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,310
erase it
and we can we can change this to

400
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
and we can we can change this to
 

401
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,870
and we can we can change this to
n exclusive cow

402
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
n exclusive cow
 

403
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,070
n exclusive cow
and one right if this

404
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
and one right if this
 

405
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,630
and one right if this
that's it and then count plus equals one

406
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
that's it and then count plus equals one
 

407
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,350
that's it and then count plus equals one
right

408
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
right
 

409
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,310
right
yeah got it yeah equal equal one

410
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
yeah got it yeah equal equal one
 

411
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,030
yeah got it yeah equal equal one
actually

412
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
actually
 

413
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,750
actually
equal equal one but we can we can we can

414
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
equal equal one but we can we can we can
 

415
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,030
equal equal one but we can we can we can
just

416
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
just
 

417
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,110
just
ignore uh just just uh make it simple

418
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
ignore uh just just uh make it simple
 

419
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,310
ignore uh just just uh make it simple
okay all right does it make sense

420
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
okay all right does it make sense
 

421
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,670
okay all right does it make sense
yeah no that's it

422
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
yeah no that's it
 

423
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,350
yeah no that's it
these two can be simplified by this

424
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
these two can be simplified by this
 

425
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,430
these two can be simplified by this
yeah because actually we are looking for

426
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
yeah because actually we are looking for
 

427
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,269
yeah because actually we are looking for
different signs zero and one

428
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
different signs zero and one
 

429
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,670
different signs zero and one
one and zero okay so it's basically the

430
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
one and zero okay so it's basically the
 

431
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,630
one and zero okay so it's basically the
exclusive off

432
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
exclusive off
 

433
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,829
exclusive off
okay what's the time complexity

434
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839

 

435
00:09:48,839 --> 00:10:09,910

oh

436
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920

 

437
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,190

because we're not using any uh linear

438
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
because we're not using any uh linear
 

439
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,350
because we're not using any uh linear
addition space yeah we're just using one

440
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
addition space yeah we're just using one
 

441
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,310
addition space yeah we're just using one
variable

442
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
variable
 

443
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,790
variable
yeah got it okay so i'm going to erase

444
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
yeah got it okay so i'm going to erase
 

445
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,949
yeah got it okay so i'm going to erase
this piece okay so can you tell me

446
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
this piece okay so can you tell me
 

447
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,430
this piece okay so can you tell me
okay if n equals if current digit is

448
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
okay if n equals if current digit is
 

449
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,710
okay if n equals if current digit is
zero and what

450
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
zero and what
 

451
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,350
zero and what
i if currently this is one you know what

452
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
i if currently this is one you know what
 

453
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,389
i if currently this is one you know what
and this is all

454
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
and this is all
 

455
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,550
and this is all
okay okay i'll make it simple for you

456
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
okay okay i'll make it simple for you
 

457
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,230
okay okay i'll make it simple for you
come on

come on
 

459
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,990
come on
okay so you just need to tell me what

460
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,000
okay so you just need to tell me what
 

461
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,430
okay so you just need to tell me what
they did well these two

462
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
they did well these two
 

463
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,269
they did well these two
if current digit is yellow and what

464
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
if current digit is yellow and what
 

465
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,389
if current digit is yellow and what
what to do with the count okay yeah all

466
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
what to do with the count okay yeah all
 

467
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,590
what to do with the count okay yeah all
right

468
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
right
 

469
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,910
right
okay we do it yeah

470
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
okay we do it yeah
 

471
00:10:47,920 --> 00:11:25,980
okay we do it yeah
okay come on faster

472
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:25,990

and then what's next
 

483
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,829
and then what's next
i know what's the next one if we

484
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
i know what's the next one if we
 

485
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,590
i know what's the next one if we
currently there is one and

486
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
currently there is one and
 

487
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,430
currently there is one and
we we flipping we flipping one

488
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
we we flipping we flipping one
 

489
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,350
we we flipping we flipping one
or even number ten right one because

490
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
or even number ten right one because
 

491
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,670
or even number ten right one because
yeah that's it does it make sense can

492
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
yeah that's it does it make sense can
 

493
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,030
yeah that's it does it make sense can
you explain to me one more time what's

494
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
you explain to me one more time what's
 

495
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,910
you explain to me one more time what's
this mean

496
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
this mean
 

497
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,350
this mean
it means if we flip this

498
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
it means if we flip this
 

499
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,269
it means if we flip this
number if this current digit is zero and

500
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
number if this current digit is zero and
 

501
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:05,990
number if this current digit is zero and
