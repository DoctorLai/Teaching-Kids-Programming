7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,950

so today we are talking about the

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
so today we are talking about the
 

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,630
so today we are talking about the
intervals

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,640

 

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,110

so can you tell me what's interval

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
so can you tell me what's interval
 

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,910
so can you tell me what's interval
interval

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,920
interval
 

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,670
interval
what's the interval why why don't be shy

16
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
what's the interval why why don't be shy
 

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,389
what's the interval why why don't be shy
you know you

18
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
you know you
 

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,390
you know you
you know you just say intervals

20
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:44,400
you know you just say intervals
 

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:44,910
you know you just say intervals

is yellow yeah yeah we got the numbers

26
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
is yellow yeah yeah we got the numbers
 

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,310
is yellow yeah yeah we got the numbers
on it and

28
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
on it and
 

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,590
on it and
integers yellow be only one month

30
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600

 

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,630

and and it can be half of it maybe

32
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
and and it can be half of it maybe
 

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,030
and and it can be half of it maybe
you know 1.5 yeah something like that

34
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
you know 1.5 yeah something like that
 

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,109
you know 1.5 yeah something like that
like these are called fraction of

36
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
like these are called fraction of
 

37
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,710
like these are called fraction of
all real numbers yes all these are

38
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
all real numbers yes all these are
 

39
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,789
all real numbers yes all these are
called real numbers okay and these are

40
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
called real numbers okay and these are
 

41
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,429
called real numbers okay and these are
integers

42
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
integers
 

43
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,230
integers
integers okay the intervals for example

44
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
integers okay the intervals for example
 

45
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,310
integers okay the intervals for example
like interval it could be

46
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
like interval it could be
 

47
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,789
like interval it could be
zero one so it could be zero one yeah so

48
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
zero one so it could be zero one yeah so
 

49
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,789
zero one so it could be zero one yeah so
it means this is the interval yeah

50
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
it means this is the interval yeah
 

51
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,109
it means this is the interval yeah
okay yeah yeah one

52
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
okay yeah yeah one
 

53
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,630
okay yeah yeah one
is one yeah yeah what how about i give

54
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
is one yeah yeah what how about i give
 

55
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,310
is one yeah yeah what how about i give
you a list of intervals

56
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
you a list of intervals
 

57
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:46,870
you a list of intervals
like uh zero uh

58
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880

 

59
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,190

okay and then maybe minus one ten

60
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
okay and then maybe minus one ten
 

61
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,069
okay and then maybe minus one ten
okay okay so what does it mean yeah what

62
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
okay okay so what does it mean yeah what
 

63
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,950
okay okay so what does it mean yeah what
does the mean

64
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
does the mean
 

65
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,910
does the mean
zero one here is here yeah two three

66
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
zero one here is here yeah two three
 

67
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,789
zero one here is here yeah two three
yeah

68
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
yeah
 

69
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,389
yeah
they're not intercepting each other

70
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
they're not intercepting each other
 

71
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,149
they're not intercepting each other
right separate yeah

72
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
right separate yeah
 

73
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,429
right separate yeah
five six maybe here five six is here

74
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
five six maybe here five six is here
 

75
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,389
five six maybe here five six is here
yeah

76
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399

 

77
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,630

yeah minus one yeah and then i need to

78
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
yeah minus one yeah and then i need to
 

79
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,350
yeah minus one yeah and then i need to
do this or minus one

80
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
do this or minus one
 

81
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,190
do this or minus one
okay so can you tell me that if there is

82
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
okay so can you tell me that if there is
 

83
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,030
okay so can you tell me that if there is
a if there is a

84
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
a if there is a
 

85
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,390
a if there is a
interval that is part of every interval

86
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
interval that is part of every interval
 

87
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,430
interval that is part of every interval
i mean

88
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440

 

89
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,990

do you know what i'm talking about okay

90
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
do you know what i'm talking about okay
 

91
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,430
do you know what i'm talking about okay
for example like

92
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
for example like
 

93
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,710
for example like
if this is 0 1 zero one two

94
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
if this is 0 1 zero one two
 

95
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,830
if this is 0 1 zero one two
three four five zero five and then if

96
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
three four five zero five and then if
 

97
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,110
three four five zero five and then if
they are

98
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
they are
 

99
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,470
they are
uh they are this is two

100
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
uh they are this is two
 

101
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,390
uh they are this is two
two six okay two six so the interval

102
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
two six okay two six so the interval
 

103
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,589
two six okay two six so the interval
part will be two to five correct

104
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
part will be two to five correct
 

105
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,030
part will be two to five correct
yes in this section so look t

106
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
yes in this section so look t
 

107
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,830
yes in this section so look t
six here this is the part of interval

108
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
six here this is the part of interval
 

109
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,229
six here this is the part of interval
and then

110
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
and then
 

111
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,750
and then
here is the parting you know what's the

112
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
here is the parting you know what's the
 

113
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,830
here is the parting you know what's the
common part

114
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
common part
 

115
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,149
common part
it's this tip yeah this period this

116
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
it's this tip yeah this period this
 

117
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,270
it's this tip yeah this period this
speed is the common part the

118
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
speed is the common part the
 

119
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,869
speed is the common part the
intercession is yellow yeah

120
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
intercession is yellow yeah
 

121
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,949
intercession is yellow yeah
so for this one is there intersecting

122
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
so for this one is there intersecting
 

123
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,910
so for this one is there intersecting
each

124
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
each
 

125
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,710
each
no no because these three are separate

126
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
no no because these three are separate
 

127
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,990
no no because these three are separate
and then they're not common

128
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
and then they're not common
 

129
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,990
and then they're not common
right so how about if i tell you that

130
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
right so how about if i tell you that
 

131
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,229
right so how about if i tell you that
give you a list of intervals and i want

132
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
give you a list of intervals and i want
 

133
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,229
give you a list of intervals and i want
you to find out if they are

134
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
you to find out if they are
 

135
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,309
you to find out if they are
if they are common intervals and what

136
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
if they are common intervals and what
 

137
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,149
if they are common intervals and what
are they what way

138
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159

 

139
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,830

do you know do you understand this

140
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
do you know do you understand this
 

141
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,589
do you know do you understand this
problem no

142
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
problem no
 

143
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,110
problem no
not really okay look look

144
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
not really okay look look
 

145
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,190
not really okay look look
[Music]

146
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
[Music]
 

147
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,949
[Music]
okay right if i zero one

148
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
okay right if i zero one
 

149
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,190
okay right if i zero one
two three four five six seven eight nine

150
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
two three four five six seven eight nine
 

151
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,229
two three four five six seven eight nine
look if this

152
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
look if this
 

153
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,630
look if this
is zero two like i give you an interval

154
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
is zero two like i give you an interval
 

155
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,990
is zero two like i give you an interval
here yeah zero two

156
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
here yeah zero two
 

157
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,470
here yeah zero two
yeah and i also give you an interval one

158
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
yeah and i also give you an interval one
 

159
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,149
yeah and i also give you an interval one
three so what's the common part

160
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
three so what's the common part
 

161
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,949
three so what's the common part
one two exactly okay so let's say

162
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
one two exactly okay so let's say
 

163
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:53,589
one two exactly okay so let's say
suppose

164
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
suppose
 

165
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,630
suppose
there are a list of the uh uh

166
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
there are a list of the uh uh
 

167
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,710
there are a list of the uh uh
i mean there are n intervals yes there

168
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
i mean there are n intervals yes there
 

169
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,670
i mean there are n intervals yes there
are intervals

170
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
are intervals
 

171
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,390
are intervals
and then can you tell me try to design

172
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
and then can you tell me try to design
 

173
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,190
and then can you tell me try to design
the

174
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
the

177
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,229
algorithm to find an algorithm
yeah it's a way to design a way a method

178
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
yeah it's a way to design a way a method
 

179
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,270
yeah it's a way to design a way a method
to find our

180
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
to find our
 

181
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,390

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,710
comment in the comment the common part
of

184
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
of
 

185
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:22,150
of
all intervals do you know how to do it

186
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160

 

187
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,909

how about this style is two two

188
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
how about this style is two two
 

189
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,310
how about this style is two two
intervals like zero two

190
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
intervals like zero two
 

191
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,390
intervals like zero two
zero two and one three so how can you

192
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
zero two and one three so how can you
 

193
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,660
zero two and one three so how can you
find the intervals of this

194
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:29,670
find the intervals of this
 

195
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:39,110
find the intervals of this
[Music]

196
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120

 

197
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,310

any idea how how can we find this

198
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
any idea how how can we find this
 

199
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,150
any idea how how can we find this
so at least if this is look

200
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
so at least if this is look
 

201
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,189
so at least if this is look
we just have to draw it no but the

202
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
we just have to draw it no but the
 

203
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,030
we just have to draw it no but the
computer don't know how to draw so

204
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
computer don't know how to draw so
 

205
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,469
computer don't know how to draw so
i give you a hint okay i see it

206
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
i give you a hint okay i see it
 

207
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,990
i give you a hint okay i see it
i give you a hint so 20

208
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
i give you a hint so 20
 

209
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,070
i give you a hint so 20
that's yeah something about the one two

210
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
that's yeah something about the one two
 

211
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,070
that's yeah something about the one two
yeah but how how how to get this one how

212
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
yeah but how how how to get this one how
 

213
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,909
yeah but how how how to get this one how
to get these two

214
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
to get these two
 

215
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,150
to get these two
so for the left boundary yeah for the

216
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
so for the left boundary yeah for the
 

217
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,590
so for the left boundary yeah for the
left starting power

218
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
left starting power
 

219
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,150
left starting power
we want to find out the maximum of all

220
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
we want to find out the maximum of all
 

221
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,270
we want to find out the maximum of all
the

222
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
the
 

223
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,230
the
intervals the left we want to find out

224
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
intervals the left we want to find out
 

225
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,550
intervals the left we want to find out
the

226
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
the
 

227
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,590
the
maximum of these uh the starting

228
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
maximum of these uh the starting
 

229
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,790
maximum of these uh the starting
of the all intervals right yes

230
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
of the all intervals right yes
 

231
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,110
of the all intervals right yes
and fallout's ending point finishing

232
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
and fallout's ending point finishing
 

233
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,110
and fallout's ending point finishing
point we want to find out the

234
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
point we want to find out the
 

235
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,150
point we want to find out the
minimum of the all the intervals

236
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
minimum of the all the intervals
 

237
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,350
minimum of the all the intervals
yes yeah does it make sense

238
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
yes yeah does it make sense
 

239
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,390
yes yeah does it make sense
yeah look look this interval

240
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
yeah look look this interval
 

241
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,590
yeah look look this interval
the first star we want to get the next

242
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
the first star we want to get the next
 

243
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:39,909
the first star we want to get the next
uh

244
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
uh
 

245
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,950
uh
bigger one yeah right and then for let's

246
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
bigger one yeah right and then for let's
 

247
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,830
bigger one yeah right and then for let's
finish we want to get a smaller one yeah

248
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
finish we want to get a smaller one yeah
 

249
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,430
finish we want to get a smaller one yeah
so then it will be the interval yeah can

250
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
so then it will be the interval yeah can
 

251
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,029
so then it will be the interval yeah can
i try yeah but that's part

252
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
i try yeah but that's part
 

253
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,070
i try yeah but that's part
drawing yeah but look if i don't i even

254
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
drawing yeah but look if i don't i even
 

255
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,310
drawing yeah but look if i don't i even
i

256
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
i
 

257
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,629
i
i don't draw and you tell me okay like

258
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
i don't draw and you tell me okay like
 

259
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,749
i don't draw and you tell me okay like
uh

260
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
uh
 

261
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,029
uh
five ten and then

262
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
five ten and then
 

263
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,309
five ten and then
uh three and seven so what's the

264
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
uh three and seven so what's the
 

265
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,790
uh three and seven so what's the
common part what's the common part

266
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
common part what's the common part
 

267
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,270
common part what's the common part
remember we want to find the maximum the

268
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
remember we want to find the maximum the
 

269
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,029
remember we want to find the maximum the
starting point the first number

270
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
starting point the first number
 

271
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,670
starting point the first number
five three plus seven sorry

272
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
five three plus seven sorry
 

273
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,469
five three plus seven sorry
these three seven yeah five seven yeah

274
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
these three seven yeah five seven yeah
 

275
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,830
these three seven yeah five seven yeah
we want to this one

276
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
we want to this one
 

277
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,629
we want to this one
yes the first number we want to find out

278
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
yes the first number we want to find out
 

279
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,110
yes the first number we want to find out
uh

280
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
uh
 

281
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,350
uh
the maximum of all this interval which

282
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
the maximum of all this interval which
 

283
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,029
the maximum of all this interval which
is five and then the second number we

284
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
is five and then the second number we
 

285
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,870
is five and then the second number we
want to find the minimum of all these

286
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
want to find the minimum of all these
 

287
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,909
want to find the minimum of all these
which is seven yeah five seven yeah is

288
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
which is seven yeah five seven yeah is
 

289
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:32,629
which is seven yeah five seven yeah is
it two

290
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
it two
 

291
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,670
it two
if we draw it let's find

292
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
if we draw it let's find
 

293
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,110
if we draw it let's find
10 and then three seven and of course

294
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
10 and then three seven and of course
 

295
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,309
10 and then three seven and of course
the interval is this bit yeah yeah and

296
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
the interval is this bit yeah yeah and
 

297
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,670
the interval is this bit yeah yeah and
if we have a lot this surface can be

298
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
if we have a lot this surface can be
 

299
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,029
if we have a lot this surface can be
applied to it yeah

300
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
applied to it yeah
 

301
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,790
applied to it yeah
so let's learn this please

302
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
so let's learn this please
 

303
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,469
so let's learn this please
define define interval

304
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
define define interval
 

305
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,550
define define interval
interval intersection in the section

306
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
interval intersection in the section
 

307
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:14,469
interval intersection in the section
column and let's go to

308
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479

 

309
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,550

right equals the first one yeah so

310
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
right equals the first one yeah so
 

311
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,469
right equals the first one yeah so
so the first one will be uh

312
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479

 

313
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:35,589

the first first element is zero zero

314
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599

 

315
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,629

yeah so this is the intervals of given

316
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
yeah so this is the intervals of given
 

317
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,110
yeah so this is the intervals of given
these intervals are given like that yeah

318
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
these intervals are given like that yeah
 

319
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,909
these intervals are given like that yeah
5

320
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
5
 

321
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,909
5
3 and then three ten yeah

322
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919

 

323
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:55,749

are you okay yes are you okay yeah okay

324
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759

 

325
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,990

how about the interval is nothing so if

326
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
how about the interval is nothing so if
 

327
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,589
how about the interval is nothing so if
if it's nothing if

328
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
if it's nothing if
 

329
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,510
if it's nothing if
it doesn't contain any animal we need to

330
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
it doesn't contain any animal we need to
 

331
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,869
it doesn't contain any animal we need to
store uh return

332
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
store uh return
 

333
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,990
store uh return
uh return what's this yeah let's okay we

334
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
uh return what's this yeah let's okay we
 

335
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,909
uh return what's this yeah let's okay we
can return

336
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
can return
 

337
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,749
can return
we have four or anything so an

338
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
we have four or anything so an
 

339
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,110
we have four or anything so an
exceptional section

340
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
exceptional section
 

341
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,110
exceptional section
so look we can check if if

342
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
so look we can check if if
 

343
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,510
so look we can check if if
length yeah this interval

344
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520

 

345
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,950

equals zero then we return

346
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
equals zero then we return
 

347
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,189
equals zero then we return
return long okay because there's none

348
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
return long okay because there's none
 

349
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,189
return long okay because there's none
intersection and we will return

350
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
intersection and we will return
 

351
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,189
intersection and we will return
long interval and obviously there's no

352
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
long interval and obviously there's no
 

353
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,469
long interval and obviously there's no
intersection so this interval zero

354
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
intersection so this interval zero
 

355
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,909
intersection so this interval zero
interval zero is this yeah

356
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
interval zero is this yeah
 

357
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,870
interval zero is this yeah
interval zero zero is this this okay so

358
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
interval zero zero is this this okay so
 

359
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,990
interval zero zero is this this okay so
the left

360
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
the left
 

361
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,949
the left
interval zero one is zero one so it's

362
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
interval zero one is zero one so it's
 

363
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:43,430
interval zero one is zero one so it's
seven

364
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
seven
 

365
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,829
seven
okay so that's right left is five right

366
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
okay so that's right left is five right
 

367
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,269
okay so that's right left is five right
is seven okay

368
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
is seven okay
 

369
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,750
is seven okay
and then now we're looping the interval

370
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
and then now we're looping the interval
 

371
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,269
and then now we're looping the interval
for i

372
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
for i
 

373
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,630
for i
in range in not in now

374
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640

 

375
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,670

yeah in the full group

376
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
yeah in the full group
 

377
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,190
yeah in the full group
so now now now left

378
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
so now now now left
 

379
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,389
so now now now left
equals max we want to get the maximum of

380
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
equals max we want to get the maximum of
 

381
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,430
equals max we want to get the maximum of
all the starting point which is i

382
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
all the starting point which is i
 

383
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,190
all the starting point which is i
zero right right we want to get a

384
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
zero right right we want to get a
 

385
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,750
zero right right we want to get a
5 for the first coordinate interval

386
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
5 for the first coordinate interval
 

387
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,470
5 for the first coordinate interval
starting with

388
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
starting with
 

389
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,110
starting with
interval we want to get the maximum yeah

390
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
interval we want to get the maximum yeah
 

391
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,870
interval we want to get the maximum yeah
and then for the right we want to get a

392
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
and then for the right we want to get a
 

393
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,550
and then for the right we want to get a
minimum right so which is mean

394
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
minimum right so which is mean
 

395
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,470
minimum right so which is mean
yeah right what's this what's the what's

396
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
yeah right what's this what's the what's
 

397
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,070
yeah right what's this what's the what's
this i what put the number here interval

398
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
this i what put the number here interval
 

399
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,509
this i what put the number here interval
i what this is one one yeah that's one

400
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
i what this is one one yeah that's one
 

401
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,030
i what this is one one yeah that's one
because

402
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
because
 

403
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,590
because
yeah and now we have left and right but

404
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
yeah and now we have left and right but
 

405
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,670
yeah and now we have left and right but
up if there's no interval what do we do

406
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
up if there's no interval what do we do
 

407
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,070
up if there's no interval what do we do
look

408
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
look
 

409
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,590
look
if we if this is this is one two and

410
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
if we if this is this is one two and
 

411
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,870
if we if this is this is one two and
this is three three four and what

412
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
this is three three four and what
 

413
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,350
this is three three four and what
happened in this case

414
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
happened in this case
 

415
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,710
happened in this case
the left will be three yeah

416
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
the left will be three yeah
 

417
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,190
the left will be three yeah
finally the left will be three and right

418
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
finally the left will be three and right
 

419
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,790
finally the left will be three and right
will be two right

420
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
will be two right
 

421
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,430
will be two right
yeah so let's left will be bigger than

422
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
yeah so let's left will be bigger than
 

423
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,070
yeah so let's left will be bigger than
the right

424
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
the right
 

425
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,389
the right
right which doesn't make sense there's

426
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
right which doesn't make sense there's
 

427
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,750
right which doesn't make sense there's
no interval right

428
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
no interval right
 

429
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,230
no interval right
yes this is no interval right because

430
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
yes this is no interval right because
 

431
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,509
yes this is no interval right because
one two and three four

432
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
one two and three four
 

433
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,829
one two and three four
they don't in uh they don't intersect

434
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
they don't in uh they don't intersect
 

435
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,949
they don't in uh they don't intersect
right

436
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
right
 

437
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,350
right
yes so but in this case if we got a

438
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
yes so but in this case if we got a
 

439
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,350
yes so but in this case if we got a
maximum of left which is one and three

440
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
maximum of left which is one and three
 

441
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,829
maximum of left which is one and three
which is

442
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
which is
 

443
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,230
which is
three and the minimum of the right which

444
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
three and the minimum of the right which
 

445
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,990
three and the minimum of the right which
is two and four which is two

446
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
is two and four which is two
 

447
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,269
is two and four which is two
and now left is three right is two

448
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
and now left is three right is two
 

449
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,190
and now left is three right is two
what does mean no interval no

450
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
what does mean no interval no
 

451
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,790
what does mean no interval no
intersection yeah

452
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
intersection yeah
 

453
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,150
intersection yeah
so if left

454
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
so if left
 

455
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,670
so if left
left bigger and right

456
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680

 

457
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,110

return noun yeah because there's no

458
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
return noun yeah because there's no
 

459
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,949
return noun yeah because there's no
intersection okay

460
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
intersection okay
 

461
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,910
intersection okay
yeah and otherwise return what determine

462
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
yeah and otherwise return what determine
 

463
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,590
yeah and otherwise return what determine
the intensity

464
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
the intensity
 

465
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,870
the intensity
left and right okay

466
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
left and right okay
 

467
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:53,190
left and right okay
got

468
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200

 

469
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,829

does it make sense yeah what's the

470
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839

 

471
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,460

complexity

472
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:03,470

 

473
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:26,550

[Applause]

474
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560

 

475
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,870

and what's the space complexities of one

476
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
and what's the space complexities of one
 

477
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,910
and what's the space complexities of one
right because we

478
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
right because we
 

479
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,949
right because we
are only allocating the constant space

480
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
are only allocating the constant space
 

481
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,269
are only allocating the constant space
the left and right and it doesn't we

482
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
the left and right and it doesn't we
 

483
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,310
the left and right and it doesn't we
don't need to

484
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
don't need to
 

485
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,310
don't need to
i locate uh the space

486
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
i locate uh the space
 

487
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,470
i locate uh the space
it is likely if there are any intervals

488
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
it is likely if there are any intervals
 

489
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,590
it is likely if there are any intervals
we don't need to

490
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:43,600
we don't need to
 

491
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,949
we don't need to
the space we allocate that do not uh

492
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
the space we allocate that do not uh
 

493
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,829
the space we allocate that do not uh
increase as the size of the input okay

494
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
increase as the size of the input okay
 

495
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,150
increase as the size of the input okay
so

496
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
so
 

497
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,629
so
it's constant left and right okay so now

498
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
it's constant left and right okay so now
 

499
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,150
it's constant left and right okay so now
right

500
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160

 

501
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,190

i'm relaxing okay so now can you tell me

502
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
i'm relaxing okay so now can you tell me
 

503
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,670
i'm relaxing okay so now can you tell me
can you tell me if if left and right is

504
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
can you tell me if if left and right is
 

505
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,310
can you tell me if if left and right is
equal

506
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
equal
 

507
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,710
equal
is this still interval like if it is 0 0

508
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
is this still interval like if it is 0 0
 

509
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,710
is this still interval like if it is 0 0
and 0 1 what's the interval

510
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
and 0 1 what's the interval
 

511
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,540
and 0 1 what's the interval
of this what's the intersection of this

512
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:21,550
of this what's the intersection of this
 

513
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,269
of this what's the intersection of this

zero zero zero so so yes zero zero is

516
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
zero zero zero so so yes zero zero is
 

517
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,590
zero zero zero so so yes zero zero is
still valid intervals so so it doesn't

518
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
still valid intervals so so it doesn't
 

519
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:29,910
still valid intervals so so it doesn't
look

520
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
look
 

521
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,949
look
if if you put if in this case

522
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
if if you put if in this case
 

523
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,870
if if you put if in this case
left will be zero right will be zero so

524
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
left will be zero right will be zero so
 

525
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:46,389
left will be zero right will be zero so
we're still retaining zero zero okay

526
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399

 

527
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,310

function so it actually will return the

528
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
function so it actually will return the
 

529
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,110
function so it actually will return the
maximum of these two values right

530
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
maximum of these two values right
 

531
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,590
maximum of these two values right
so if you if you want to write it as

532
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
so if you if you want to write it as
 

533
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,350
so if you if you want to write it as
evil you can write write this this way

534
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
evil you can write write this this way
 

535
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,829
evil you can write write this this way
if

536
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
if
 

537
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,069
if
i zero is bigger than left

538
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
i zero is bigger than left
 

539
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,750
i zero is bigger than left
column left equals i zero okay

540
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
column left equals i zero okay
 

541
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,190
column left equals i zero okay
and then mean is the same if if i1

542
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
and then mean is the same if if i1
 

543
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,150
and then mean is the same if if i1
is smaller than right then because we

544
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
is smaller than right then because we
 

545
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,190
is smaller than right then because we
find a

546
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
find a
 

547
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,310
find a
new smaller uh right then we

548
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
new smaller uh right then we
 

549
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,069
new smaller uh right then we
do this right equals i one all right

550
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
do this right equals i one all right
 

551
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,269
do this right equals i one all right
okay so any questions no no

552
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
okay so any questions no no
 

553
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,030
okay so any questions no no
interesting interesting yeah okay say

554
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
interesting interesting yeah okay say
 

555
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,880
interesting interesting yeah okay say
bye-bye merry christmas and happy new

556
