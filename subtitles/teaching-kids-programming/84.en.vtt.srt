okay so i'll tell you in a minute
happy numbers are ones that can get lots

12
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
happy numbers are ones that can get lots
 

13
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,990
happy numbers are ones that can get lots
of different time tables

14
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
of different time tables
 

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,230
of different time tables
uh no okay so look

16
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
uh no okay so look
 

17
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,509
uh no okay so look
19 okay so it's one another

18
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
19 okay so it's one another
 

19
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,630
19 okay so it's one another
so i transfer it to one power 1 to the

20
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
so i transfer it to one power 1 to the
 

21
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,709
so i transfer it to one power 1 to the
power of 2 plus 9 to the power 2

22
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
power of 2 plus 9 to the power 2
 

23
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,630
power of 2 plus 9 to the power 2
which is what 1 plus 81

24
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
which is what 1 plus 81
 

25
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,990
which is what 1 plus 81
that's 82 right yeah 82 and then i keep

26
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
that's 82 right yeah 82 and then i keep
 

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,110
that's 82 right yeah 82 and then i keep
transferring to

28
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
transferring to
 

29
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,630
transferring to
a square plus 2 square which is

30
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
a square plus 2 square which is
 

31
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,670
a square plus 2 square which is
when you stop come on you see 64 plus 4

32
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
when you stop come on you see 64 plus 4
 

33
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,549
when you stop come on you see 64 plus 4
yeah 17 it gets more 64 plus 4

34
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
yeah 17 it gets more 64 plus 4
 

35
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:03,670
yeah 17 it gets more 64 plus 4
68 68

36
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680

 

37
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,350

that's 36 plus 64.

38
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
that's 36 plus 64.
 

39
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,390
that's 36 plus 64.
100 100 okay and then that would be one

40
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,400
100 100 okay and then that would be one
 

41
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,950
100 100 okay and then that would be one
power plus zero power plus zero power

42
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:12,960
power plus zero power plus zero power
 

43
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,830
power plus zero power plus zero power
which is one okay and then you keep

44
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
which is one okay and then you keep
 

45
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,590
which is one okay and then you keep
going you'll be one and one yeah

46
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
going you'll be one and one yeah
 

47
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,870
going you'll be one and one yeah
yeah so one if it's ending

48
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
yeah so one if it's ending
 

49
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,149
yeah so one if it's ending
using one is a heavy number okay

50
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
using one is a heavy number okay
 

51
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,510
using one is a heavy number okay
so basically you take it you split each

52
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
so basically you take it you split each
 

53
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,950
so basically you take it you split each
you take each digit square it

54
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
you take each digit square it
 

55
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,590
you take each digit square it
and get the sum yeah and repeatedly do

56
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
and get the sum yeah and repeatedly do
 

57
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,270
and get the sum yeah and repeatedly do
it until you get a one

58
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
it until you get a one
 

59
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,310
it until you get a one
or does that oh it's repeatedly

60
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
or does that oh it's repeatedly
 

61
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,510
or does that oh it's repeatedly
all for example like 2 2

62
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
all for example like 2 2
 

63
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,590
all for example like 2 2
4 16 and i was at 1 plus

64
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
4 16 and i was at 1 plus
 

65
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,910
4 16 and i was at 1 plus
1 plus the 36 which is 37

66
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
1 plus the 36 which is 37
 

67
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,870
1 plus the 36 which is 37
and then 3 square plus seven square

68
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
and then 3 square plus seven square
 

69
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,990
and then 3 square plus seven square

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
before and then you
 

101
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,350
before and then you
go to 16 and you go again and again so

102
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
go to 16 and you go again and again so
 

103
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,509
go to 16 and you go again and again so
it never ends one and it's

104
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
it never ends one and it's
 

105
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,149
it never ends one and it's
it's repeated it never ends right so

it's repeated it never ends right so
 

107
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,229
it's repeated it never ends right so
this is not a happy number because

108
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
this is not a happy number because
 

109
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:08,790
this is not a happy number because
it won't end at one right

110

given the positive

118
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
given the positive
 

119
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,149
given the positive
anyway it's a positive number okay you

120
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
anyway it's a positive number okay you
 

121
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,869
anyway it's a positive number okay you
can so any number given is a positive

122
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
can so any number given is a positive
 

123
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,750
can so any number given is a positive
number okay

124

number okay
 

125
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,229
number okay
so given a positive number check if it's

126
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
so given a positive number check if it's
 

127
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,350
so given a positive number check if it's
a happy number

128
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
a happy number
 

129
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,350
a happy number
or not

130
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360

 

131
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,350

so can you tell me how um

132
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
so can you tell me how um
 

133
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,830
so can you tell me how um
in order to check if the number has

134
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
in order to check if the number has
 

135
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,670
in order to check if the number has
appeared before what kind of data

136
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
appeared before what kind of data
 

137
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,869
appeared before what kind of data
structure do we need

138
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879

 

139
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,270

yeah notebook or headshot yeah also

140
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
yeah notebook or headshot yeah also
 

141
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,550
yeah notebook or headshot yeah also
because we need to

142
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
because we need to
 

143
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,990
because we need to
need a place to remember the numbers we

144
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
need a place to remember the numbers we
 

145
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,710
need a place to remember the numbers we
have

146
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
have
 

147
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,390
have
calculate we have seen before right yes

148
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
calculate we have seen before right yes
 

149
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,789
calculate we have seen before right yes
and then how do we how do we extract the

150
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
and then how do we how do we extract the
 

151
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,710
and then how do we how do we extract the
digit for example 19 how do we

152
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
digit for example 19 how do we
 

153
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,750
digit for example 19 how do we
how do we get the digit 9

154
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
how do we get the digit 9
 

155
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,509
how do we get the digit 9
and how do we get the digit one so

156
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
and how do we get the digit one so
 

157
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,869
and how do we get the digit one so
how do we extract the digit so this one

158
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
how do we extract the digit so this one
 

159
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,750
how do we extract the digit so this one
equals what nineteen divided by ten

160
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
equals what nineteen divided by ten
 

161
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,309
equals what nineteen divided by ten
right

162
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
right
 

163
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,910
right
and this is nine equals one 19

164
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
and this is nine equals one 19
 

165
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,349
and this is nine equals one 19
what okay fill in the operator here

166
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
what okay fill in the operator here
 

167
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,670
what okay fill in the operator here
i already teach you this one is 19

168
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
i already teach you this one is 19
 

169
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,430
i already teach you this one is 19
divided by 10

170
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
divided by 10
 

171
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,550
divided by 10
yeah the integer part and 9

172
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
yeah the integer part and 9
 

173
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,990
yeah the integer part and 9
is 19 what 10. remember that

174
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
is 19 what 10. remember that
 

175
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,070
is 19 what 10. remember that
symbol modulus do you still remember

176
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
symbol modulus do you still remember
 

177
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,510
symbol modulus do you still remember
how do we do the modulus in circle

178
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
how do we do the modulus in circle
 

179
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,510
how do we do the modulus in circle
so can you write down

180
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520

 

181
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,150

yeah go down modulus this is the model

182
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
yeah go down modulus this is the model
 

183
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,710
yeah go down modulus this is the model
ryan

184
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
ryan
 

185
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,710
ryan
percentage okay you can also create

186
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
percentage okay you can also create
 

187
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,790
percentage okay you can also create
percentage so basically this is

188
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
percentage so basically this is
 

189
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,270
percentage so basically this is
19 minus 19 divided by 10 right right

190
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
19 minus 19 divided by 10 right right
 

191
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,390
19 minus 19 divided by 10 right right
yes oh no this is nothing but it is 10

192
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
yes oh no this is nothing but it is 10
 

193
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,189
yes oh no this is nothing but it is 10
and then

194
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
and then
 

195
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,550
and then
times constant okay okay

196
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
times constant okay okay
 

197
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,710
times constant okay okay
so let's see that's the basic

198
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
so let's see that's the basic
 

199
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,790
so let's see that's the basic
okay let's let's write it okay define

200
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
okay let's let's write it okay define
 

201
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,390
okay let's let's write it okay define
is happy okay he's happy

202
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
is happy okay he's happy
 

203
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,390
is happy okay he's happy
and um

204
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400

 

205
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,790

okay so we we're just using the very

206
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
okay so we we're just using the very
 

207
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,870
okay so we we're just using the very
this is tilted

208
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
this is tilted
 

209
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,430
this is tilted
yeah yeah i know okay so you just kind

210
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
yeah yeah i know okay so you just kind
 

211
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,189
yeah yeah i know okay so you just kind
of

212
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
of
 

213
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,110
of
okay so now we use the d it's a set

214
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
okay so now we use the d it's a set
 

215
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,710
okay so now we use the d it's a set
okay this is the notebook okay yes

216
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
okay this is the notebook okay yes
 

217
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,270
okay this is the notebook okay yes
yeah why why why

218
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
yeah why why why
 

219
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,070
yeah why why why
n is not equals one right because one is

220
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
n is not equals one right because one is
 

221
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,310
n is not equals one right because one is
n

222
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
n
 

223
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,350
n
one now we need to stop and

224
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
one now we need to stop and
 

225
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,629
one now we need to stop and
and one and not

226
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
and one and not
 

227
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,990
and one and not
n in d so we we haven't seen this number

228
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
n in d so we we haven't seen this number
 

229
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,590
n in d so we we haven't seen this number
in the notebook yeah

230
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
in the notebook yeah
 

231
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,150
in the notebook yeah
one happy number yes of course because

232
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,160
one happy number yes of course because
 

233
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,830
one happy number yes of course because
one times one time one

234
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
one times one time one
 

235
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,150
one times one time one
one square is one and the u squared is

236
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
one square is one and the u squared is
 

237
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,510
one square is one and the u squared is
one it always

238
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
one it always
 

239
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,710
one it always
stays at one it's happy yeah yeah okay

240
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
stays at one it's happy yeah yeah okay
 

241
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,430
stays at one it's happy yeah yeah okay
so why

242
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
so why
 

243
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,710
so why
why n is not one and

244
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
why n is not one and
 

245
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,230
why n is not one and
n it's not seen in a in a notebook

246
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
n it's not seen in a in a notebook
 

247
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,270
n it's not seen in a in a notebook
so we need to square the numbers

248
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
so we need to square the numbers
 

249
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,710
so we need to square the numbers
right square the num digits

250
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
right square the num digits
 

251
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,749
right square the num digits
yeah so so let's do current current

252
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
yeah so so let's do current current
 

253
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,189
yeah so so let's do current current
equals n okay

254
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
equals n okay
 

255
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,830
equals n okay
and then the number sum we add it as

256
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
and then the number sum we add it as
 

257
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,870
and then the number sum we add it as
zero okay

258
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
zero okay
 

259
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,029
zero okay
yeah this is this will be stored as the

260
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
yeah this is this will be stored as the
 

261
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,150
yeah this is this will be stored as the
number of the

262
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
number of the
 

263
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,189
number of the
the sum okay this is the stoner sum and

264
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
the sum okay this is the stoner sum and
 

265
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,749
the sum okay this is the stoner sum and
this hash means the common okay sum okay

266
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
this hash means the common okay sum okay
 

267
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,070
this hash means the common okay sum okay
wire c u r bigger than zl outcome

268
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
wire c u r bigger than zl outcome
 

269
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,510
wire c u r bigger than zl outcome
yeah a plus equal

270
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
yeah a plus equal
 

271
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,029
yeah a plus equal
what c u r modulus 10

272
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039

 

273
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,070

times times two okay so square yeah

274
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
times times two okay so square yeah
 

275
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,070
times times two okay so square yeah
look see one percentage

276
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
look see one percentage
 

277
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,110
look see one percentage
yeah percentage modulus 10 is the

278
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
yeah percentage modulus 10 is the
 

279
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,830
yeah percentage modulus 10 is the
it's the it's a one yeah it's the ones

280
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
it's the it's a one yeah it's the ones
 

281
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,189
it's the it's a one yeah it's the ones
it's the number for example 1

282
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
it's the number for example 1
 

283
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,790
it's the number for example 1
9 is the 9 okay yeah and i square it

284
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
9 is the 9 okay yeah and i square it
 

285
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,749
9 is the 9 okay yeah and i square it
yeah

286
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
yeah
 

287
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,950
yeah
right i add it to a and then what should

288
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
right i add it to a and then what should
 

289
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,749
right i add it to a and then what should
i do here

290
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
i do here
 

291
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,510
i do here
i need to divide the column by 10 right

292
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
i need to divide the column by 10 right
 

293
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,110
i need to divide the column by 10 right
so c u r

294
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
so c u r
 

295
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,950
so c u r
divide the equal one 10 where down yeah

296
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
divide the equal one 10 where down yeah
 

297
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,909
divide the equal one 10 where down yeah
yeah yeah yeah because i i need to

298
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
yeah yeah yeah because i i need to
 

299
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,909
yeah yeah yeah because i i need to
separate on this okay

300
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
separate on this okay
 

301
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,270
separate on this okay
and then a now is the

302
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
and then a now is the
 

303
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,710
and then a now is the
sum yeah ae will be 81 plus

304
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
sum yeah ae will be 81 plus
 

305
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,469
sum yeah ae will be 81 plus
1 is 82 right 82 and then now i need to

306
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
1 is 82 right 82 and then now i need to
 

307
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,070
1 is 82 right 82 and then now i need to
set n equals what hey

308
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
set n equals what hey
 

309
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,790

because look at this set we need to add
 

327
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,830
because look at this set we need to add
it to the set yeah

328
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
it to the set yeah
 

329
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,749
it to the set yeah
it's not in the same and i need to add

330
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
it's not in the same and i need to add
 

331
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,510
it's not in the same and i need to add
it the number in the set

332
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
it the number in the set
 

333
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,309
it the number in the set
right so next time when we see this

334
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
right so next time when we see this
 

335
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,990
right so next time when we see this
number

336
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
number
 

337
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,629
number
then we we don't want to compute it

338
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
then we we don't want to compute it
 

339
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,990
then we we don't want to compute it
again right because we need to add a

340
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
again right because we need to add a
 

341
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,430
again right because we need to add a
number

342
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
number
 

343
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,189
number
yes this is the way

344
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
yes this is the way
 

345
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,550
yes this is the way
to calculate the numbers digit by t

346
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
to calculate the numbers digit by t
 

347
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,670
to calculate the numbers digit by t
but we can also compute the numbers

348
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
but we can also compute the numbers
 

349
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,589
but we can also compute the numbers
convert the numbers into a string right

350
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
convert the numbers into a string right
 

351
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,829
convert the numbers into a string right
so this bit okay this bit how can we do

352
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
so this bit okay this bit how can we do
 

353
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,269
so this bit okay this bit how can we do
it

354
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
it
 

355
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,310
it
okay this is return and equals one right

356
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320

 

357
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,230

so anyway if

358
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
so anyway if
 

359
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,590
so anyway if
this n right i can convert it to i can i

360
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
this n right i can convert it to i can i
 

361
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,550
this n right i can convert it to i can i
can do this

362
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
can do this
 

363
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,070
can do this
um a equals zero and then

364
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
um a equals zero and then
 

365
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,350
um a equals zero and then
for i in star

366
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
for i in star
 

367
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,269
for i in star
i convert it to i convert it to string

368
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
i convert it to i convert it to string
 

369
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,910
i convert it to i convert it to string
yeah when i have converted the string

370
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
yeah when i have converted the string
 

371
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,710
yeah when i have converted the string
the i

372
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
the i
 

373
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,110
the i
will be the character what's the iascii

374
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
will be the character what's the iascii
 

375
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,590
will be the character what's the iascii
code

376
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
code
 

377
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,190

65 category 97

382
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
65 category 97
 

383
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,790
65 category 97
hello okay so look i converted to

384
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
hello okay so look i converted to
 

385
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,150
hello okay so look i converted to
i converted to numbers and then i i

386
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
i converted to numbers and then i i
 

387
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,590
i converted to numbers and then i i
plus equals i convert it back i convert

388
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
plus equals i convert it back i convert
 

389
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,190
plus equals i convert it back i convert
it back to integer right look

390
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
it back to integer right look
 

391
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,110
it back to integer right look
look these be integer i squared square

392
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
look these be integer i squared square
 

393
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,870
look these be integer i squared square
two okay and then n equals a so this

394
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
two okay and then n equals a so this
 

395
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,710
two okay and then n equals a so this
this thing can be represented by that

396
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
this thing can be represented by that
 

397
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,230
this thing can be represented by that
okay okay

in i will turn this i turn this two
 

403
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,870
in i will turn this i turn this two
to the number two okay in the means to

404
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
to the number two okay in the means to
 

405
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,509
to the number two okay in the means to
convert

convert
 

407
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,710
convert
this string to this

408
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
this string to this
 

409
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,870
this string to this
yeah alternatively i i can do this

410
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
yeah alternatively i i can do this
 

411

so this thing we can use

438
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
so this thing we can use
 

439
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,910
so this thing we can use
this thing we can use the python in you

440
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
this thing we can use the python in you
 

441
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,190
this thing we can use the python in you
know a very fancy syntax which is look

442
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
know a very fancy syntax which is look
 

443
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,550
know a very fancy syntax which is look
these three yeah this way i can do this

444
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
these three yeah this way i can do this
 

445
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,750
these three yeah this way i can do this
look look this at least these four lines

446
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
look look this at least these four lines
 

447
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,190
look look this at least these four lines
i can do this

448
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
i can do this
 

449
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,110
i can do this
and equals sum okay i want to sum the

450
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
and equals sum okay i want to sum the
 

451
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,910
and equals sum okay i want to sum the
digit

452
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
digit
 

453
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,110
digit
but what's the sum x square

454
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
but what's the sum x square
 

455
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,470
but what's the sum x square
x squared s square okay x

456
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
x squared s square okay x
 

457
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,069
x squared s square okay x
square

458
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079

 

459
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,430

actually is in x

460
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
actually is in x
 

461
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,590
actually is in x
times times two is a happy number

462
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
times times two is a happy number
 

463
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,350
times times two is a happy number
not really no no a good guess

464
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
not really no no a good guess
 

465
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,069
not really no no a good guess
but i don't know maybe maybe it is you

466
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
but i don't know maybe maybe it is you
 

467
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,509
but i don't know maybe maybe it is you
have to prove it okay

468
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
have to prove it okay
 

469
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,269
have to prove it okay
for example like 2 is the prime number

470
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
for example like 2 is the prime number
 

471
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,630
for example like 2 is the prime number
but it's not happy number

472
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:40,640
but it's not happy number
 

473
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,550
but it's not happy number
yeah we just blew it yeah then

474
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
yeah we just blew it yeah then
 

475
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,350
yeah we just blew it yeah then
okay three okay let's get three

476
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
okay three okay let's get three
 

477
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,870

505
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,230
16 plus 25
what what's that 42 can we see 42 before

506
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
what what's that 42 can we see 42 before
 

507
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,350
what what's that 42 can we see 42 before
no

508
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
no
 

509
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,030

511
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,550
16 plus 4 20
okay and that's four it's not a prime

512
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
okay and that's four it's not a prime
 

513
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,509
okay and that's four it's not a prime
yeah

514
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
yeah
 

515
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,829
yeah
so it's it's not true okay bigger than

516
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
so it's it's not true okay bigger than
 

517
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,870
so it's it's not true okay bigger than
five and

518
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
five and
 

519
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,710
five and
bigger than six okay you can you need

520
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
bigger than six okay you can you need
 

521
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,069
bigger than six okay you can you need
yeah you can say okay uh any prime

522
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
yeah you can say okay uh any prime
 

523
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,629
yeah you can say okay uh any prime
number which is not two three five

524
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
number which is not two three five
 

525
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,870
number which is not two three five
you pick the one yeah i see how this is

526
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
you pick the one yeah i see how this is
 

527
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,269
you pick the one yeah i see how this is
going good good job good job you can

528
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
going good good job good job you can
 

529
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,430
going good good job good job you can
write the program to test your theory

530
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
write the program to test your theory
 

531
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:15,910
write the program to test your theory
okay

532
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
okay
 

533
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,629
okay
look this this one i can write it some

534
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
look this this one i can write it some
 

535
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,870
look this this one i can write it some
which take a somewhat a list

536
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
which take a somewhat a list
 

537
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,110
which take a somewhat a list
into x time times two for

538
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
into x time times two for
 

539
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,150
into x time times two for
x in star

540
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
x in star
 

541
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,670
x in star
n and bracket nothing

542
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
n and bracket nothing
 

543
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,470
n and bracket nothing
so look list can be replaced by left and

544
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
so look list can be replaced by left and
 

545
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,310
so look list can be replaced by left and
that can be replaced by the single line

546
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
that can be replaced by the single line
 

547
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,910
that can be replaced by the single line
okay but this is quite fancy

548
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
okay but this is quite fancy
 

549
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,110
okay but this is quite fancy
present syntax i don't expect you to

550
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
present syntax i don't expect you to
 

551
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,590
present syntax i don't expect you to
learn you just have a taste of how it

552
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
learn you just have a taste of how it
 

553
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,990
learn you just have a taste of how it
looks like so look sum is a function

554
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
looks like so look sum is a function
 

555
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,710
looks like so look sum is a function
somewhat sum the functions some have a

556
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
somewhat sum the functions some have a
 

557
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,750
somewhat sum the functions some have a
noise bleed

558
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
noise bleed
 

559
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,910
noise bleed
okay go get the sum the length

560
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920

 

561
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,030

sum the list of numbers look

562
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
sum the list of numbers look
 

563
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,110
sum the list of numbers look
times itself and the x is in the n

564
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,120
times itself and the x is in the n
 

565
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,629
times itself and the x is in the n
which is converted to star okay so

566
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
which is converted to star okay so
 

567
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,990
which is converted to star okay so
can i can i raise a bit

568
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
can i can i raise a bit
 

569
