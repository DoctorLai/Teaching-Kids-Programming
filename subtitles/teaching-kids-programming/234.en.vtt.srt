today
easy today's task is easy

56
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799

 

57
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,830

we given the number n right this is

58
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
we given the number n right this is
 

59
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,950
we given the number n right this is
number n like

60
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
number n like
 

61
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,030
number n like
five if we given this number integer n

62
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040
five if we given this number integer n
 

63
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,390
five if we given this number integer n
which is five three two one number

64
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
which is five three two one number
 

65
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,870
which is five three two one number
so we want to know how many a b c how

66
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
so we want to know how many a b c how
 

67
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,270
so we want to know how many a b c how
many a squared plus b square equals c

68
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
many a squared plus b square equals c
 

69
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,030
many a squared plus b square equals c
if a smaller equal

70
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
if a smaller equal
 

71
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,710
if a smaller equal
n bigger equal one b smaller equal

72
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
n bigger equal one b smaller equal
 

73
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,230
n bigger equal one b smaller equal
n bigger equal one c smaller equal n

74
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,240
n bigger equal one c smaller equal n
 

75
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,789
n bigger equal one c smaller equal n
bigger than one yeah basically these

76
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
bigger than one yeah basically these
 

77
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,630
bigger than one yeah basically these
numbers needs to be bigger or equal than

78
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
numbers needs to be bigger or equal than
 

79
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,469
numbers needs to be bigger or equal than
one is smaller equal than n

80
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
one is smaller equal than n
 

81
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,069
one is smaller equal than n
so a b c a b c all b

82
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
so a b c a b c all b
 

83
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,310
so a b c a b c all b
all belongs to uh this is called belong

84
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
all belongs to uh this is called belong
 

85
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,310
all belongs to uh this is called belong
that belongs to one

86
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
that belongs to one
 

87
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,350
that belongs to one
inclusive and inclusive okay

88
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
inclusive and inclusive okay
 

89
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,869
inclusive and inclusive okay
so we want to call how many of these

90
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
so we want to call how many of these
 

91
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,949
so we want to call how many of these
players if n is five so can you cut

92
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959

the other triplet eight six ten
 

167
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,830
the other triplet eight six ten
yeah we're done so you need to tell me

168
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
yeah we're done so you need to tell me
 

169
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,710
yeah we're done so you need to tell me
is

170
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
is
 

171
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,149
is
is what is four right

172
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
is what is four right
 

173
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,830
is what is four right
any other pairs any other triple

174
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
any other pairs any other triple
 

175
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,509
any other pairs any other triple
receivers and it's given 10 yeah it's

176

only for you
 

179
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,149
only for you
okay any idea how we're solving this

180
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
okay any idea how we're solving this
 

181
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,589
okay any idea how we're solving this
you got the idea right you got the idea

182
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
you got the idea right you got the idea
 

183
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,710
you got the idea right you got the idea
yeah

184
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
yeah
 

185
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,429
yeah
the abc look abcs are between the rings

186
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
the abc look abcs are between the rings
 

187
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,789
the abc look abcs are between the rings
one to end so we what

188
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
one to end so we what
 

189
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,869
one to end so we what
we can do first yeah proof of weather

190
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
we can do first yeah proof of weather
 

191
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,270
we can do first yeah proof of weather
yeah

192
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
yeah
 

193
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,309
yeah
so we can ask computer to try how how

194
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
so we can ask computer to try how how
 

195
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,190
so we can ask computer to try how how
will we try improve us

196
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
will we try improve us
 

197
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,630
will we try improve us
how can triangle how can we try

198
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
how can triangle how can we try
 

199
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,229
how can triangle how can we try
easy we can do this

200
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
easy we can do this
 

201
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,870
easy we can do this
yeah we can do this for a in range

202
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
yeah we can do this for a in range
 

203
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,510
yeah we can do this for a in range
range what start from one and what

204
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
range what start from one and what
 

205
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,790
range what start from one and what
should happen here

206
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
should happen here
 

207
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,510
should happen here
the last one yeah because it needs to be

208
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
the last one yeah because it needs to be
 

209
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,150
the last one yeah because it needs to be
n right

210
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
n right
 

211
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,430
n right
and four okay all right when we when we

212
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
and four okay all right when we when we
 

213
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,189
and four okay all right when we when we
prove us and we want to bruise for sp

214
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199
prove us and we want to bruise for sp
 

215
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,150
prove us and we want to bruise for sp
yeah

216
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
yeah
 

217
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,909
yeah
rent if answer is count yeah if answer

218
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
rent if answer is count yeah if answer
 

219
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,030
rent if answer is count yeah if answer
is

220
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
is
 

221
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,230
is
range one one

222
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
range one one
 

223
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,510
range one one
and plus one and you can do another one

224
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
and plus one and you can do another one
 

225
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,070
and plus one and you can do another one
for c

226
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
for c
 

227
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,430
for c
in range that's gonna be a long time

228
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
in range that's gonna be a long time
 

229
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,909
in range that's gonna be a long time
yeah

230
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
yeah
 

231
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,710
yeah
yeah okay now abc will prove what's in

232
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
yeah okay now abc will prove what's in
 

233
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,670
yeah okay now abc will prove what's in
it and then look

234
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
it and then look
 

235
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,870
it and then look
if if a times a all you

236
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
if if a times a all you
 

237
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,790
if if a times a all you
can do is to start a to the power of 2

238
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
can do is to start a to the power of 2
 

239
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,390
can do is to start a to the power of 2
this is the same as a times

240
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
this is the same as a times
 

241
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,270
this is the same as a times
a right plus b to the power of 2

242
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
a right plus b to the power of 2
 

243
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,390
a right plus b to the power of 2
equals 1 what

244
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
equals 1 what
 

245
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,909
equals 1 what
c to the power of 2 then we do this

246
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
c to the power of 2 then we do this
 

247
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,629
c to the power of 2 then we do this
answer plus

248
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
answer plus
 

249
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,909
answer plus
equal 1 and then we can add okay

250
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
equal 1 and then we can add okay
 

251
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,029
equal 1 and then we can add okay
this 8 a times times 2

252
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
this 8 a times times 2
 

253
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,270
this 8 a times times 2
you can write it as a times a or

254
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
you can write it as a times a or
 

255
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,029
you can write it as a times a or
power minus the power a two okay this

256
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
power minus the power a two okay this
 

257
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,749
power minus the power a two okay this
one

258
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
one
 

259
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,629
one
these three are the same thing okay okay

260
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
these three are the same thing okay okay
 

261
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,710
these three are the same thing okay okay
the same thing

262
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
the same thing
 

263
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,870
the same thing
okay which one you like the best these

264
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
okay which one you like the best these
 

265
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,950
okay which one you like the best these
three pick one

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
three pick one
 

267
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,990
three pick one
um

268
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000

 

269
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,590

there's no right or wrong answer come on

270
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
there's no right or wrong answer come on
 

271
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,830
there's no right or wrong answer come on
give me one come on

272
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840

 

273
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,070

equally

274
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080

 

275
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,710

okay okay i like this one i like this

276
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
okay okay i like this one i like this
 

277
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,990
okay okay i like this one i like this
one this one

278
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
one this one
 

279
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,710
one this one
to the top the first one this is calling

280
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
to the top the first one this is calling
 

281
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,590
to the top the first one this is calling
a function

282
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
a function
 

283
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,070
a function
i just particularly like it um no reason

284
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
i just particularly like it um no reason
 

285
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,350
i just particularly like it um no reason
messed up

286
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
messed up
 

287
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,189
messed up
okay what's the time complexity of this

288
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
okay what's the time complexity of this
 

289
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,110
okay what's the time complexity of this
one

290
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
one
 

291
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,270
one
cubic where that what's a space

292
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
cubic where that what's a space
 

293
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,469
cubic where that what's a space
complexity

294
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
complexity
 

295
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,510
complexity
um

296
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520

 

297
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,070

what yeah well can we do better can we

298
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
what yeah well can we do better can we
 

299
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,510
what yeah well can we do better can we
do better

300
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
do better
 

301
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,029
do better
can we do better

302
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039

 

303
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,270

look we can integrate a b when we

304
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
look we can integrate a b when we
 

305
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,870
look we can integrate a b when we
iterate a b

306
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
iterate a b
 

307
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,629
iterate a b
can we calculate the value of c yeah

308
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
can we calculate the value of c yeah
 

309
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,710
can we calculate the value of c yeah
oh yeah we can generally remember c and

310
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
oh yeah we can generally remember c and
 

311
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,230
oh yeah we can generally remember c and
we just want to know if c

312
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
we just want to know if c
 

313
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,870
we just want to know if c
is smaller than equal and and it's also

314
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
is smaller than equal and and it's also
 

315
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,909
is smaller than equal and and it's also
integer right

316
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
integer right
 

317
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,070
integer right
so instead of blue forcing c we can get

318
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
so instead of blue forcing c we can get
 

319
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,350
so instead of blue forcing c we can get
rid of this eric

320
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
rid of this eric
 

321
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,390
rid of this eric
get rid of this so see what

322
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
get rid of this so see what
 

323
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,670
get rid of this so see what
c equals one you are

324
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680

 

325
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,950

a times a plus b

326
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
a times a plus b
 

327
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,589
a times a plus b
times b okay i know

328
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599

 

329
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,070

okay so let's square root a can you how

330
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
okay so let's square root a can you how
 

331
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,870
okay so let's square root a can you how
can you write this

332
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
can you write this
 

333
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,150
can you write this
square root of a

334

351
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,909
root of eight
no how is the 2 square root of 16 is 4

352
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
no how is the 2 square root of 16 is 4
 

353
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,350
no how is the 2 square root of 16 is 4
right it's which number square is 7

354
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
right it's which number square is 7
 

355
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,469
right it's which number square is 7
equals 16 that's

356
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
equals 16 that's
 

357
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,469
equals 16 that's
that's half of it so what what's that

358
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
that's half of it so what what's that
 

359
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,830
that's half of it so what what's that
half half 0.5 or half yeah this is zero

360
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
half half 0.5 or half yeah this is zero
 

361
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,230
half half 0.5 or half yeah this is zero
yeah

362
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,240
yeah
 

363
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,710
yeah
okay this is the same so if this is the

364
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
okay this is the same so if this is the
 

365
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,430
okay this is the same so if this is the
same i can do this

366
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
same i can do this
 

367
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,790
same i can do this
a times times 0.5

368
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
a times times 0.5
 

369
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,749
a times times 0.5
why this square root or or you can do

370
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
why this square root or or you can do
 

371
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:57,990
why this square root or or you can do
this

372
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
this
 

373
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,830
this
or mass power a 0.5 or

374
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
or mass power a 0.5 or
 

375
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,469
or mass power a 0.5 or
a 0.5 or you can use this function sqlt

376
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
a 0.5 or you can use this function sqlt
 

377
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,589
a 0.5 or you can use this function sqlt
plus a function master sqlt a this

378
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
plus a function master sqlt a this
 

379
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,550
plus a function master sqlt a this
is exactly the there's three ways one

380
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
is exactly the there's three ways one
 

381
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,189
is exactly the there's three ways one
two three

382
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
two three
 

383
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,550
two three
okay correct one two three you can

384
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
okay correct one two three you can
 

385
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,749
okay correct one two three you can
calculate this but this

386
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
calculate this but this
 

387
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,070
calculate this but this
returns a number not essentially like

388
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
returns a number not essentially like
 

389
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,510
returns a number not essentially like
integer we want to check if it's

390
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
integer we want to check if it's
 

391
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,150
integer we want to check if it's
integer right if it's not integer we

392
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
integer right if it's not integer we
 

393
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,830
integer right if it's not integer we
don't count it

394
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
don't count it
 

395
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,430
don't count it
yeah yeah square square root look

396
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
yeah yeah square square root look
 

397
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,790
yeah yeah square square root look
square root square root okay it's true

398
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
square root square root okay it's true
 

399
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,750
square root square root okay it's true
for square root

400
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
for square root
 

401
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,870
for square root
so look if c is alright so

402
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
so look if c is alright so
 

403
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,630
so look if c is alright so
we do work so we can do this integer

404
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
we do work so we can do this integer
 

405
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,169
we do work so we can do this integer
we call it integer integer

406
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:43,179
we call it integer integer
 

407
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,030
we call it integer integer
[Music]

408
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
[Music]
 

409
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,190
[Music]
square root so let's call it uh let's

410
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
square root so let's call it uh let's
 

411
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,190
square root so let's call it uh let's
call it sqrt right and

412
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
call it sqrt right and
 

413
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,710
call it sqrt right and
we call it integer so now c is that

414
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
we call it integer so now c is that
 

415
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,829
we call it integer so now c is that
but now we want to check if this is c

416
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
but now we want to check if this is c
 

417
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,829
but now we want to check if this is c
a squared plus b square we take a square

418
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
a squared plus b square we take a square
 

419
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,030
a squared plus b square we take a square
root but we want to convert it to the

420
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
root but we want to convert it to the
 

421
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,670
root but we want to convert it to the
integer

422
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
integer
 

423
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,030
integer
maybe because c might be 3.5 right

424
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
maybe because c might be 3.5 right
 

425
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,710
maybe because c might be 3.5 right
we convert it to integer using the

426
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
we convert it to integer using the
 

427
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,350
we convert it to integer using the
function just get rid of this 0.5

428
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
function just get rid of this 0.5
 

429
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,630
function just get rid of this 0.5
if c times c equal equal

430
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
if c times c equal equal
 

431
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,150
if c times c equal equal
a times a plus b times b

432
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
a times a plus b times b
 

433
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,630
a times a plus b times b
yeah and and c is smaller or equal

434
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
yeah and and c is smaller or equal
 

435
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,269
yeah and and c is smaller or equal
n right then we can do this we can do

436
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
n right then we can do this we can do
 

437
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,150
n right then we can do this we can do
this plus one even does it make sense

438
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
this plus one even does it make sense
 

439
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,670
this plus one even does it make sense
yeah yeah all right

440
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
yeah yeah all right
 

441
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,230
yeah yeah all right
so if c smaller e because c might be

442
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
so if c smaller e because c might be
 

443
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,870
so if c smaller e because c might be
bigger than

444
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
bigger than
 

445
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,750
bigger than
n and we want to calculate if c is an

446
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
n and we want to calculate if c is an
 

447
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,710
n and we want to calculate if c is an
integer if you see

448
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
integer if you see
 

449
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,470
integer if you see
because we are converting to integer bar

450
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
because we are converting to integer bar
 

451
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,790
because we are converting to integer bar
we only uh

452
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
we only uh
 

453
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,509
we only uh
we only keep the integer part right if

454
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
we only keep the integer part right if
 

455
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,190
we only keep the integer part right if
it's a whole if that's a square number

456
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
it's a whole if that's a square number
 

457
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,190
it's a whole if that's a square number

what i mean you see

480
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
what i mean you see
 

481
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,710
what i mean you see
if if c is a square squared number

482
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
if if c is a square squared number
 

483
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,430
if if c is a square squared number
i took the integer bar and times itself

484
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
i took the integer bar and times itself
 

485
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,230
i took the integer bar and times itself
squared itself

486
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
squared itself
 

487
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,710
squared itself
is also equal a times a plus b times b

488
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
is also equal a times a plus b times b
 

489
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,430
is also equal a times a plus b times b
and this

490
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
and this
 

491
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,829
and this
uh this requirement still satisfies so

492
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
uh this requirement still satisfies so
 

493
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,310
uh this requirement still satisfies so
what's the time capacity of this one

494
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
what's the time capacity of this one
 

495
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,750
what's the time capacity of this one
of this approach oh n square

496
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
of this approach oh n square
 

497
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,350
of this approach oh n square
oh yeah n squared what's the space

498
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
oh yeah n squared what's the space
 

499
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,829
oh yeah n squared what's the space
complexity oh

500
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
complexity oh
 

501
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,030
complexity oh
one yeah so which one is better

502
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
one yeah so which one is better
 

503
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,509
one yeah so which one is better
this one yeah also remember this square

504
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
this one yeah also remember this square
 

505
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,150
this one yeah also remember this square

00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
we consider it as a one okay it's
 

509
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,350
we consider it as a one okay it's
extremely very fast

510
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
extremely very fast
 

511
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,069
extremely very fast
but nowadays the cpu the computer cpu

the computer okay
 

519
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,990
the computer okay
it's a small chip it's a cpu smart chip

520
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
it's a small chip it's a cpu smart chip
 

521
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,150
it's a small chip it's a cpu smart chip
smart chip is a brand of uh

522
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
smart chip is a brand of uh
 

523
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,509
smart chip is a brand of uh
what of another cpu yeah

524
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
what of another cpu yeah
 

525
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,550
what of another cpu yeah

unit okay the brand

532
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
unit okay the brand
 

533
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,790
unit okay the brand
the brand of computer yeah makes sense

534
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
the brand of computer yeah makes sense
 

535
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,250
the brand of computer yeah makes sense
it's a small chip it's not

536
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:30,260

539
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,230

okay so so that one is is

540
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
okay so so that one is is
 

541
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,190
okay so so that one is is
uh o n square so we're gonna open square

542
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
uh o n square so we're gonna open square
 

543
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,670
uh o n square so we're gonna open square
but we can still make it faster

544
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680
but we can still make it faster
 

545
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,629
but we can still make it faster
right why is that look answer equals

546
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
right why is that look answer equals
 

547
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,310
right why is that look answer equals
zero let's try it again

548
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
zero let's try it again
 

549
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,790
zero let's try it again
for a in rent

550
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
for a in rent
 

551
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,069
for a in rent
n plus one right so before we we

552
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
n plus one right so before we we
 

553
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,350
n plus one right so before we we
b will be also for b

554
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
b will be also for b
 

555
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,670
b will be also for b
in range n plus one right

556
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:07,680
in range n plus one right
 

557
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,870
in range n plus one right
and we do the do thing yeah

558
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
and we do the do thing yeah
 

559
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,030
and we do the do thing yeah
the thing is we increment answer plus

560
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
the thing is we increment answer plus
 

561
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,150
the thing is we increment answer plus
equal one okay

562
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
equal one okay
 

563
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,990
equal one okay
so look if c equals integer power

564
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
so look if c equals integer power
 

565
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,230
so look if c equals integer power
square root a plus a squared plus b

566
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
square root a plus a squared plus b
 

567
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,230
square root a plus a squared plus b
squared okay i you just use this one

568
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
squared okay i you just use this one
 

569
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,069
squared okay i you just use this one
okay i don't can say what

570
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
okay i don't can say what
 

571
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,829
okay i don't can say what
remember if c is smaller equal n

572
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
remember if c is smaller equal n
 

573
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,190
remember if c is smaller equal n
and and y what should i do c square

574
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
and and y what should i do c square
 

575
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,829
and and y what should i do c square
equals

576
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:33,839
equals
 

577
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,710
equals
equals a squared plus b squared okay

578
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
equals a squared plus b squared okay
 

579
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,190
equals a squared plus b squared okay
okay

580
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
okay
 

581
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,790
okay
this is not position if you want to

582
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
this is not position if you want to
 

583
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,030
this is not position if you want to
write it remember you can do c times c

584
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
write it remember you can do c times c
 

585
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,310
write it remember you can do c times c
or c times times two okay all

586
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
or c times times two okay all
 

587
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,230
or c times times two okay all
power c two okay okay

588
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
power c two okay okay
 

589
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,350
power c two okay okay
there's always three ways

590
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
there's always three ways
 

591
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,030
there's always three ways
look look the problem this is we can

592
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
look look the problem this is we can
 

593
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,870
look look the problem this is we can
improve this why because this is

594
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
improve this why because this is
 

595
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,230
improve this why because this is
incrementing one

596
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
incrementing one
 

597
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,030
incrementing one
all right right so what does it mean

598
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
all right right so what does it mean
 

599
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,470
all right right so what does it mean
remember we have three four

600
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
remember we have three four
 

601
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,110
remember we have three four
five once we found three four five we

602
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
five once we found three four five we
 

603
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,990
five once we found three four five we
also know

604
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
also know
 

605
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,710
also know
four three five interchangeable a and b

606
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
four three five interchangeable a and b
 

607
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,230
four three five interchangeable a and b
interchangeable right

608
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
interchangeable right
 

609
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,430
interchangeable right
yeah so instead of count increment one

610
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
yeah so instead of count increment one
 

611
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,269
yeah so instead of count increment one
we can increment two if we found one of

612
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
we can increment two if we found one of
 

613
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,310
we can increment two if we found one of
these

614
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
these
 

615
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,990
these
and one can increment two because we

616
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
and one can increment two because we
 

617
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,310
and one can increment two because we
found three four we know four three all

618
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
found three four we know four three all
 

619
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,190
found three four we know four three all
right

620
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
right
 

621
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,190
right
yeah okay so first of all first of all

622
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
yeah okay so first of all first of all
 

623
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,910
yeah okay so first of all first of all
a could a and b equal could a and b

624
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
a could a and b equal could a and b
 

625
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,910
a could a and b equal could a and b
equal

626
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
equal
 

627
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,150
equal
a and b equal yes or no

628
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
a and b equal yes or no
 

629
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,949
a and b equal yes or no
think a and b equal

630
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959

 

631
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,110

look if a and b equal what happened a

632
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
look if a and b equal what happened a
 

633
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,310
look if a and b equal what happened a
square plus

634
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
square plus
 

635
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,310
square plus
a b equals a squared plus a square

636
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
a b equals a squared plus a square
 

637
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,990
a b equals a squared plus a square
equals c squared right

638
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
equals c squared right
 

639
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,030
equals c squared right
yeah so this is 2a squared

640
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
yeah so this is 2a squared
 

641
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,150
yeah so this is 2a squared
equals c squared all right yeah

642
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
equals c squared all right yeah
 

643
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,949
equals c squared all right yeah
if they are same i do the square root of

644
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
if they are same i do the square root of
 

645
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,910
if they are same i do the square root of
both sides

646
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
both sides
 

647
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,629
both sides
so let's square two times a equals c

648
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
so let's square two times a equals c
 

649
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,389
so let's square two times a equals c
doesn't make sense so what's this number

650
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
doesn't make sense so what's this number
 

651
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,430
doesn't make sense so what's this number
this is a irrational number

652
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
this is a irrational number
 

653
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,069
this is a irrational number
equation number in relational number

654
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
equation number in relational number
 

655
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,389
equation number in relational number
okay

656
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399

 

657
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,949

so it means it's a number it's one point

658
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
so it means it's a number it's one point
 

659
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,310
so it means it's a number it's one point
four one four blah

660
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
four one four blah
 

661
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,269
four one four blah
okay this is if this is the number of a

662
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
okay this is if this is the number of a
 

663
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,069
okay this is if this is the number of a
number

664
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079
number
 

665
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,629
number
you know it's it can't be divided by a

666
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
you know it's it can't be divided by a
 

667
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,430
you know it's it can't be divided by a
hole right

668
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
hole right
 

669
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,310
hole right
so it has the lone pair and it's going

670
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
so it has the lone pair and it's going
 

671
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,110
so it has the lone pair and it's going
forward

672
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
forward
 

673
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,470
forward
right yeah

674
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
right yeah
 

675
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,670
right yeah
so look a c a and c

676
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
so look a c a and c
 

677
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,550
so look a c a and c
could these two be both integer

678
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560

 

679
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,509

no right if a is integer c must not be

680
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
no right if a is integer c must not be
 

681
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,710
no right if a is integer c must not be
integer right

682
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720
integer right
 

683
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,629
integer right
yeah they can't be both they can't not

684
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:44,639
yeah they can't be both they can't not
 

685
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,389
yeah they can't be both they can't not
be both integer that's what i'm saying

686
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:46,399
be both integer that's what i'm saying
 

687
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,350
be both integer that's what i'm saying
so

688
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
so
 

689
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,629
so
a cannot be equals b right so we can

690
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
a cannot be equals b right so we can
 

691
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,629
a cannot be equals b right so we can
just do this we can just

692
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
just do this we can just
 

693
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,750
just do this we can just
we can just do this for a b b in range

694
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
we can just do this for a b b in range
 

695
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,030
we can just do this for a b b in range
up to a right we can just up to a yeah

696
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
up to a right we can just up to a yeah
 

697
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,389
up to a right we can just up to a yeah
instead of two n plus a so a would be uh

698
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
instead of two n plus a so a would be uh
 

699
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,750
instead of two n plus a so a would be uh
so a b will be smaller than a right so a

700
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
so a b will be smaller than a right so a
 

701
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,310
so a b will be smaller than a right so a
will be

702
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
will be
 

703
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,670
will be
b uh b one to

704
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
b uh b one to
 

705
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,509
b uh b one to
n right and b will be range of what

706
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
n right and b will be range of what
 

707
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,189
n right and b will be range of what
one to a all right look what's this

708
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
one to a all right look what's this
 

709
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,430
one to a all right look what's this
exclusive right remember yesterday we

710
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
exclusive right remember yesterday we
 

711
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,949
exclusive right remember yesterday we
talked about this is

712
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
talked about this is
 

713
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,750
talked about this is
inclusive so a we eat we brew force a

714
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
inclusive so a we eat we brew force a
 

715
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,470
inclusive so a we eat we brew force a
between

716
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
between
 

717
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,629
between
one to n inclusive and we grew from

718
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
one to n inclusive and we grew from
 

719
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,030
one to n inclusive and we grew from
speed from one to a

720
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
speed from one to a
 

721
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,069
speed from one to a
yeah this is up to a not equal to a so a

722
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
yeah this is up to a not equal to a so a
 

723
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,749
yeah this is up to a not equal to a so a
cannot be equal to b

724
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:33,759
cannot be equal to b
 

725
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,870
cannot be equal to b
then after that look and what do i do

726
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
then after that look and what do i do
 

727
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,990
then after that look and what do i do
what should i change here

728
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000

 

729
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,670

yeah we're down yeah and then let's

730
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
yeah we're down yeah and then let's
 

731
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,430
yeah we're down yeah and then let's
so d what's the temperament taxi come on

732
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
so d what's the temperament taxi come on
 

733
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,829
so d what's the temperament taxi come on
come on remember we talked about

734
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
come on remember we talked about
 

735
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,350
come on remember we talked about
convexity we

736
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
convexity we
 

737
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,870
convexity we
drop the constant so what's the time

738
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
drop the constant so what's the time
 

739
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,710
drop the constant so what's the time
complexity sorry

740
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
complexity sorry
 

741
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,470
complexity sorry
what is the one look at this of a that's

742
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
what is the one look at this of a that's
 

743
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,990
what is the one look at this of a that's
a square

744
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
a square
 

745
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,670
a square
it's still all n squared okay that's

746
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
it's still all n squared okay that's
 

747
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,829
it's still all n squared okay that's
tricky one but because why is that

748
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
tricky one but because why is that
 

749
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,110
tricky one but because why is that
because it divided by two

750
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
because it divided by two
 

751
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,150
because it divided by two
it's actually cut my line

752
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
it's actually cut my line
 

753
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,350
it's actually cut my line
square so let's so let's change context

754
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
square so let's so let's change context
 

755
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,990
square so let's so let's change context
is o n

756
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
is o n
 

757
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,389
is o n
square divided by two but we totally

758
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
square divided by two but we totally
 

759
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,910
square divided by two but we totally
talk about complexity we

760
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
talk about complexity we
 

761
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,910
talk about complexity we
drop the constant so it's zero and two

762
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
drop the constant so it's zero and two
 

763
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,829
drop the constant so it's zero and two
but this one is faster than

764
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:17,839
but this one is faster than
 

765
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,749
but this one is faster than
the second one right it's the same

766
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
the second one right it's the same
 

767
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,509
the second one right it's the same
complexity you know when we talk about

768
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
complexity you know when we talk about
 

769
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,829
complexity you know when we talk about
convexity we don't actually measure how

770
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
convexity we don't actually measure how
 

771
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,790
convexity we don't actually measure how
fast they

772
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
fast they
 

773
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,590
fast they
they actually run yeah right but this

774
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
they actually run yeah right but this
 

775
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,350
they actually run yeah right but this
one is actually taking faster because

776
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
one is actually taking faster because
 

777
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,069
one is actually taking faster because
why

778
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
why
 

779
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,949
why
because actually it has the 50 speed up

780
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
because actually it has the 50 speed up
 

781
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,590
because actually it has the 50 speed up
right

782
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
right
 

783
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,550
right
yeah because look instead of b b instead

784
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
yeah because look instead of b b instead
 

785
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,350
yeah because look instead of b b instead
of going to

786
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
of going to
 

787
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,790
of going to
n every time i only go to a right when a

788
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
n every time i only go to a right when a
 

789
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,069
n every time i only go to a right when a
is what is two b will only only go to

790
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,079
is what is two b will only only go to
 

791
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:44,710
is what is two b will only only go to
one b

792
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
one b
 

793
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,509
one b
when a is n divided by two b will only

794
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
when a is n divided by two b will only
 

795
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,430
when a is n divided by two b will only
go to the half right you get it

796
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
go to the half right you get it
 

797
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,430
go to the half right you get it
yeah that's my sense eric yeah

798
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
yeah that's my sense eric yeah
 

799
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,509
yeah that's my sense eric yeah
okay so this is this is the second

800
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
okay so this is this is the second
 

801
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,350
okay so this is this is the second
approach

802
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
approach
 

803
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,790
approach
so we can also the other approach is

804
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
so we can also the other approach is
 

805
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,590
so we can also the other approach is
that we can

806
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
that we can
 

807
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,630
that we can
we can okay the last approach okay

808
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,640

 

809
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,909

if we can check we can we can have a

810
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
if we can check we can we can have a
 

811
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,270
if we can check we can we can have a
array array okay equals fourth

812
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
array array okay equals fourth
 

813
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,789
array array okay equals fourth
fourth times n

814
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
fourth times n
 

815
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,829
fourth times n
times n plus one so this array will hold

816
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:23,839
times n plus one so this array will hold
 

817
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,230
times n plus one so this array will hold
we pre-calculate the num uh the boolean

818
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
we pre-calculate the num uh the boolean
 

819
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,990
we pre-calculate the num uh the boolean
array this is pulling for two or four

820
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
array this is pulling for two or four
 

821
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,669
array this is pulling for two or four
see if it is true it means that this

822
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
see if it is true it means that this
 

823
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,950
see if it is true it means that this
number is a square number

824
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
number is a square number
 

825
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,789
number is a square number
remember the square number so we can

826
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
remember the square number so we can
 

827
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,230
remember the square number so we can
just do this for

828
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
just do this for
 

829
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,350
just do this for
i in range

830
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
i in range
 

831
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,350
i in range
range one range n and n plus one right

832
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
range one range n and n plus one right
 

833
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,870
range one range n and n plus one right
and we can do this one a r

834
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
and we can do this one a r
 

835
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,070
and we can do this one a r
i times i equals what

836
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
i times i equals what
 

837
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,270
i times i equals what
i times i i was from one to n and i

838
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
i times i i was from one to n and i
 

839
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,870
i times i i was from one to n and i
times i equals one

840
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880

 

841
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,909

true right it means this is a square

842
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919
true right it means this is a square
 

843
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:58,710
true right it means this is a square
number right

844
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
number right
 

845
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,630
number right
and then we can go through that thingy

846
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
and then we can go through that thingy
 

847
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,549
and then we can go through that thingy
again right for a

848
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
again right for a
 

849
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,590
again right for a
in range

850
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
in range
 

851
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,789
in range
n plus one and for b

852
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
n plus one and for b
 

853
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:16,310
n plus one and for b
in branch a right

854
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320

 

855
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,830

a times a plus b times b

856
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
a times a plus b times b
 

857
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,789
a times a plus b times b
right

858
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:24,799

 

859
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,390

no actually actually no actually for a

860
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
no actually actually no actually for a
 

861
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,630
no actually actually no actually for a
in

862
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
in
 

863
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,510
in
a then we can do this b from what equals

864
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,520
a then we can do this b from what equals
 

865
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:31,990
a then we can do this b from what equals
one

866
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
one
 

867
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,110
one
and then y a times

868
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
and then y a times
 

869
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,110
and then y a times
a plus b times b

870
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
a plus b times b
 

871
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,110
a plus b times b
a a times a plus b times b smaller than

872
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
a a times a plus b times b smaller than
 

873
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,029
a a times a plus b times b smaller than
smaller than equal than n times n

874
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
smaller than equal than n times n
 

875
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,390
smaller than equal than n times n
then we'll do what uh if if

876
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,400
then we'll do what uh if if
 

877
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,710
then we'll do what uh if if
a r a times a

878
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
a r a times a
 

879
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,750
a r a times a
a square plus b square if

880
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
a square plus b square if
 

881
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,150
a square plus b square if
this is a square number right if this is

882
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,160
this is a square number right if this is
 

883
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,510
this is a square number right if this is
a square number

884
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520
a square number
 

885
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,630
a square number
uh then we answer

886
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:04,640
uh then we answer
 

887
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,750
uh then we answer
plus equals two then b plus

888
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
plus equals two then b plus
 

889
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,990
plus equals two then b plus
equals one and we can answer

890
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
equals one and we can answer
 

891
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,710
equals one and we can answer
is is it is this working let me double

892
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
is is it is this working let me double
 

893
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,470
is is it is this working let me double
check okay

894
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
check okay
 

895
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,870
check okay
so what are we doing here is what what

896
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
so what are we doing here is what what
 

897
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,669
so what are we doing here is what what
are we doing is

898
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
are we doing is
 

899
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,190
are we doing is
if we use the particular array

900
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
if we use the particular array
 

901
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,270
if we use the particular array
right if a yes if it's uh

902
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280
right if a yes if it's uh
 

903
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,230
right if a yes if it's uh
okay so if

904
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240

 

905
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,789

actually b would start from the a right

906
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799
actually b would start from the a right
 

907
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,990
actually b would start from the a right
we start from a because we're

908
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
we start from a because we're
 

909
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,510
we start from a because we're
incrementing two

910
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
incrementing two
 

911
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,950
incrementing two
right we have all right so a times

912
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
right we have all right so a times
 

913
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,110
right we have all right so a times
a plus b times b if is a small if it's a

914
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
a plus b times b if is a small if it's a
 

915
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,870
a plus b times b if is a small if it's a
square number then we increment so it's

916
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:46,880
square number then we increment so it's
 

917
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,710
square number then we increment so it's
the same thing yeah it's the previously

918
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
the same thing yeah it's the previously
 

919
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,669
the same thing yeah it's the previously
we use the sqrt

920
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:51,679
we use the sqrt
 

921
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,990
we use the sqrt
convert it to integer and then check if

922
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
convert it to integer and then check if
 

923
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,669
convert it to integer and then check if
it's a square number but now we because

924
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
it's a square number but now we because
 

925
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,390
it's a square number but now we because
we use the

926
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
we use the
 

927
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,230
we use the
checking of the array we already

928
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
checking of the array we already
 

929
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,310
checking of the array we already
calculated here

930
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
calculated here
 

931
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,390
calculated here
the time the next is still o n square

932
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
the time the next is still o n square
 

933
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,390
the time the next is still o n square
right let's space complexity what's your

934
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
right let's space complexity what's your
 

935
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,950
right let's space complexity what's your
space from rsv

936
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:05,960

yeah yeah yeah oh oh look look
 

943
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,830
yeah yeah yeah oh oh look look
oh n square right it's always good

944
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
oh n square right it's always good
 

945
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,110
oh n square right it's always good
you see oh let's go because we're

946
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
you see oh let's go because we're
 

947
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,149
you see oh let's go because we're
allocating the array of n squared plus

948
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
allocating the array of n squared plus
 

949
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,110
allocating the array of n squared plus
one yeah

950
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
one yeah
 

951
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,750

1013
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,990

yeah we don't want to check if a n times

1014
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,000
yeah we don't want to check if a n times
 

1015
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,350
yeah we don't want to check if a n times
a why are you writing there

1016
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
a why are you writing there
 

1017
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,350
a why are you writing there
they say there's a space if you have a

1018
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
they say there's a space if you have a
 

1019
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,230
they say there's a space if you have a
column yeah oh yeah

1020
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240

 

1021
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,430

a what's a y a

a what's a y a
 

1023
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,350
a what's a y a
you want to check if a square plus b

1024
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
you want to check if a square plus b
 

1025
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,430
you want to check if a square plus b
squared equals c squared right a square

1026
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
squared equals c squared right a square
 

1027
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,070
squared equals c squared right a square
you can say a you want to put an e layer

1028
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
you can say a you want to put an e layer
 

1029
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,950
you can say a you want to put an e layer
right

1030
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
right
 

1031
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,830
right
oh yeah

1032
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:06,840

 

1033
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,990

if

1034
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,000

 

1035
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,070

c squared equals a squared b squared

1036
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080

 

1037
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:28,310

c squared

1038
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320

 

1039
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:47,380

equals a

1040
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:47,390

 

1041
00:23:47,390 --> 00:24:02,950

[Music]

1042
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960

 

1043
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,029

what's the come from versus um

1044
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:07,039
what's the come from versus um
 

1045
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,230
what's the come from versus um
okay can we do better yeah okay

1046
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,240
okay can we do better yeah okay
 

1047
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,909
okay can we do better yeah okay
do you still remember how we do this

1048
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
do you still remember how we do this
 

1049
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:19,990
do you still remember how we do this
better oh and square

1050
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000

 

1051
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,750

instead of looking because we know the c

1052
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760
instead of looking because we know the c
 

1053
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,350
instead of looking because we know the c
right so c

1054
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
right so c
 

1055
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,149
right so c
we just do this integer path of square

1056
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,159
we just do this integer path of square
 

1057
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:26,789
we just do this integer path of square
root

1058
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799
root
 

1059
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,909
root
or we can just do this a squared plus b

1060
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:29,919
or we can just do this a squared plus b
 

1061
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,029
or we can just do this a squared plus b
square right and then we do the integer

1062
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:33,039
square right and then we do the integer
 

1063
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,549
square right and then we do the integer
power square root of it

1064
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:34,559
power square root of it
 

1065
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,310
power square root of it
right and then we just do this if

1066
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
right and then we just do this if
 

1067
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,110
right and then we just do this if
fc squared equals a squared plus b

1068
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
fc squared equals a squared plus b
 

1069
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,990
fc squared equals a squared plus b
squared because c

1070
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,000
squared because c
 

1071
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,830
squared because c
is not integer if n and one and

1072
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
is not integer if n and one and
 

1073
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,750
is not integer if n and one and
we want to make sure c is smaller than

1074
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
we want to make sure c is smaller than
 

1075
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,110
we want to make sure c is smaller than
equal n and that's it

1076
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
equal n and that's it
 

1077
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,830
equal n and that's it
right just a little bit all right how do

1078
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840
right just a little bit all right how do
 

1079
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,909
right just a little bit all right how do
you do this square root remember

1080
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:53,919
you do this square root remember
 

1081
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,590
you do this square root remember
square root of a is a

1082
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:57,600
square root of a is a
 

1083
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,710
square root of a is a
times times 0.5 right

1084
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:00,720
times times 0.5 right
 

1085
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,990
times times 0.5 right
because it's a half right right or you

1086
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
because it's a half right right or you
 

1087
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,470
because it's a half right right or you
can do this master power

1088
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480
can do this master power
 

1089
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,630
can do this master power
power a 0.5 or

1090
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,640
power a 0.5 or
 

1091
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,870
power a 0.5 or
sqrt mess all right master sqrt

1092
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880
sqrt mess all right master sqrt
 

1093
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,110
