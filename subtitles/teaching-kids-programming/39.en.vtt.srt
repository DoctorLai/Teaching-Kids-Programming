00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,070
hello mr teacher say hello
oh okay okay okay so so today we're

10
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
oh okay okay okay so so today we're
 

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,670
oh okay okay okay so so today we're
talking about the

12
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
talking about the
 

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,710
talking about the
linked list linked list

14
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
linked list linked list
 

15
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,990
linked list linked list
link link link list

16
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000

 

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,550

link list so can you tell me what do you

18
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
link list so can you tell me what do you
 

19
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,870
link list so can you tell me what do you
think a link list will be

20
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
think a link list will be
 

21
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,190
think a link list will be
a list that's linked

22
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200

 

23
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,549

it's another data structure so so

24
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
it's another data structure so so
 

25
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,150
it's another data structure so so
the link list consists of note

26
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
the link list consists of note
 

27
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,910
the link list consists of note
a linked note so each note

28
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
a linked note so each note
 

29
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,790
a linked note so each note
you can have a value yeah any type of

30
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
you can have a value yeah any type of
 

31
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,910
you can have a value yeah any type of
value

32
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
value
 

33
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,270
value
a value and then you also have a next

34
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
a value and then you also have a next
 

35
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,229
a value and then you also have a next
next pointer yeah pointing to another

36
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:58,239
next pointer yeah pointing to another
 

37
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,670
next pointer yeah pointing to another
one

38
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
one
 

39
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,590
one
yeah next

40
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
yeah next
 

41
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,830
yeah next
okay so you see this is going

42
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
okay so you see this is going
 

43
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,550
okay so you see this is going
so we can create a new note and then we

44
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
so we can create a new note and then we
 

45
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,990
so we can create a new note and then we
can put it into the chain

46
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
can put it into the chain
 

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,190
can put it into the chain
yeah so it's like uh

48
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
yeah so it's like uh
 

49
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,550
yeah so it's like uh
you know so it's like

50
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
you know so it's like
 

51
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,749
you know so it's like
you have a chain and then a note can be

52
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
you have a chain and then a note can be
 

53
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,190
you have a chain and then a note can be
linked to another note

54
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
linked to another note
 

55
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:38,069
linked to another note
and another note to another

56
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079

 

57
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,590

so these these are the note

58
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
so these these are the note
 

59
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,389
so these these are the note
yeah and the connection is one way or

60
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
yeah and the connection is one way or
 

61
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:44,710
yeah and the connection is one way or
you

62
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
you
 

63
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,510
you
it can be that it can be this is called

64
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,520
it can be that it can be this is called
 

65
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,149
it can be that it can be this is called
a

66
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
a
 

67
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,350
a
singly singlet linked list because it's

68
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
singly singlet linked list because it's
 

69
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,069
singly singlet linked list because it's
pointing to

70
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
pointing to
 

71
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,870
pointing to
one location uh two to one direction

72
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
one location uh two to one direction
 

73
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,350
one location uh two to one direction
only

74
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
only
 

75
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,630
only
but if we add another one backwards yeah

76
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
but if we add another one backwards yeah
 

77
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,109
but if we add another one backwards yeah
we can also add another direction to

78
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
we can also add another direction to
 

79
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,950
we can also add another direction to
link it backwards like that yeah

80
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
link it backwards like that yeah
 

81
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,149
link it backwards like that yeah
yeah like that then that will be

82
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
yeah like that then that will be
 

83
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,270
yeah like that then that will be
double link double direction link

84
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
double link double direction link
 

85
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,470
double link double direction link
w double double link

86
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
w double double link
 

87
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,750
w double double link
list double double okay double the link

88
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
list double double okay double the link
 

89
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,190
list double double okay double the link
list okay

90
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
list okay
 

91
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,190
list okay
so so it's quite similar to

92
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
so so it's quite similar to
 

93
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,430
so so it's quite similar to
the list in python remember we use the

94
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
the list in python remember we use the
 

95
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,710
the list in python remember we use the
python here like

96
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
python here like
 

97
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,510
python here like
a numbers yeah we always use numbers and

98
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
a numbers yeah we always use numbers and
 

99
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,390
a numbers yeah we always use numbers and
we can put this

100
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
we can put this
 

101
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,990
we can put this
one two three right four yes

102
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
one two three right four yes
 

103
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,830
one two three right four yes
so this is the number this is called a

104
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
so this is the number this is called a
 

105
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,949
so this is the number this is called a
list

106
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
list
 

107
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,190
list
the thing is that in in python if you're

108
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
the thing is that in in python if you're
 

109
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,390
the thing is that in in python if you're
doing this in

110
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
doing this in
 

111
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,229
doing this in
and these numbers are stored in the

112
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
and these numbers are stored in the
 

113
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,750
and these numbers are stored in the
computer memory you know

114
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
computer memory you know
 

115
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,509
computer memory you know
computer memory yeah memory like a

116
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
computer memory yeah memory like a
 

117
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,910
computer memory yeah memory like a
memory continuously so you will be

118
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
memory continuously so you will be
 

119
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,110
memory continuously so you will be
so now this address will be

120
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
so now this address will be
 

121
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,710
so now this address will be
right there yeah yeah okay so now if you

122
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
right there yeah yeah okay so now if you
 

123
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,550
right there yeah yeah okay so now if you
put another number on it and then it

124
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
put another number on it and then it
 

125
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,070
put another number on it and then it
will be append at the end

126
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
will be append at the end
 

127
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,110
will be append at the end
right yeah okay so this is called a list

128
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
right yeah okay so this is called a list
 

129
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,030
right yeah okay so this is called a list
but we are using the single is the

130
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
but we are using the single is the
 

131
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,990
but we are using the single is the
link here and then this this notes in

132
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
link here and then this this notes in
 

133
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,869
link here and then this this notes in
memory could be

134
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
memory could be
 

135
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,509
memory could be
in different places so this this value

136
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
in different places so this this value
 

137
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:09,990
in different places so this this value
will be

138
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
will be
 

139
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,710
will be
some somewhere here and then link to

140
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
some somewhere here and then link to
 

141
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,390
some somewhere here and then link to
another place in memory

142
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
another place in memory
 

143
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,390
another place in memory
and a link to another place in memory

144
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
and a link to another place in memory
 

145
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,589
and a link to another place in memory
yeah so this

146
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
yeah so this
 

147
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,830
yeah so this
next is pointing to the next note okay

148
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
next is pointing to the next note okay
 

149
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,550
next is pointing to the next note okay
so why why what's the advantage of using

150
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
so why why what's the advantage of using
 

151
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,030
so why why what's the advantage of using
that

152
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040

 

153
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,710

can you think of any advantage if

154
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
can you think of any advantage if
 

155
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,110
can you think of any advantage if
compared to this

156
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
compared to this
 

157
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,630
compared to this
you probably don't know because because

158
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
you probably don't know because because
 

159
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,110
you probably don't know because because
in lamps in in this list

160
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
in lamps in in this list
 

161
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,070
in lamps in in this list
computer allocate pre-allocate a space

162
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
computer allocate pre-allocate a space
 

163
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,830
computer allocate pre-allocate a space
continuous space like

164
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
continuous space like
 

165
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,110
continuous space like
10 elements to store these numbers yeah

166
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
10 elements to store these numbers yeah
 

167
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,509
10 elements to store these numbers yeah
if we if there's more than 10 elements

168
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
if we if there's more than 10 elements
 

169
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,470
if we if there's more than 10 elements
and if you want to

170
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
and if you want to
 

171
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,270
and if you want to
add another one so computer doesn't have

172
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
add another one so computer doesn't have
 

173
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,830
add another one so computer doesn't have
enough memory to hold these 10

174
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
enough memory to hold these 10
 

175
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,750
enough memory to hold these 10
numbers so what it does is you will find

176
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
numbers so what it does is you will find
 

177
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,509
numbers so what it does is you will find
another space which is more can hold

178
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
another space which is more can hold
 

179
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,429
another space which is more can hold
more than 10 elements and then you'll

180
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
more than 10 elements and then you'll
 

181
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,030
more than 10 elements and then you'll
copy all these numbers

182
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
copy all these numbers
 

183
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,509
copy all these numbers
to the new place just move it suppose

184
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
to the new place just move it suppose
 

185
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,470
to the new place just move it suppose
you have a table

186
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
you have a table
 

187
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,949
you have a table
but it's very small you put the five

188
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
but it's very small you put the five
 

189
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,910
but it's very small you put the five
toys on it

190
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
toys on it
 

191
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,309
toys on it
and then i give you another one toy i

192
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
and then i give you another one toy i
 

193
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,830
and then i give you another one toy i
want you to put it on the table right

194
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
want you to put it on the table right
 

195
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,229
want you to put it on the table right
you're running out of space on the table

196
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
you're running out of space on the table
 

197
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,349
you're running out of space on the table
so what do we do

198
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
so what do we do
 

199
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,670
so what do we do
so we find another big table and then

200
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
so we find another big table and then
 

201
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,550
so we find another big table and then
move these

202
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
move these
 

203
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,909
move these
five toys you know with that six toys

204
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
five toys you know with that six toys
 

205
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,670
five toys you know with that six toys
yeah yeah i have to get to the new new

206
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
yeah yeah i have to get to the new new
 

207
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,990
yeah yeah i have to get to the new new
table

208
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
table
 

209
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,870
table
so it takes time right it's sometimes so

210
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
so it takes time right it's sometimes so
 

211
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,310
so it takes time right it's sometimes so
sometimes this

212
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
sometimes this
 

213
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,110
sometimes this
uh if you append it in the worst case

214
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
uh if you append it in the worst case
 

215
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,430
uh if you append it in the worst case
the

216
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
the
 

217
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,749
the
time complexities oh and if running out

218
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
time complexities oh and if running out
 

219
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,950
time complexities oh and if running out
of space right

220
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
of space right
 

221
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,310
of space right
but these things there the the advantage

222
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
but these things there the the advantage
 

223
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,950
but these things there the the advantage
is that

224
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
is that
 

225
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,110
is that
no matter you can find a space

226
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
no matter you can find a space
 

227
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,990
no matter you can find a space
everywhere so

228
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
everywhere so
 

229
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,790
everywhere so
when you the term complexity to add a

230
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
when you the term complexity to add a
 

231
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,749
when you the term complexity to add a
new

232
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
new
 

233
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,710
new
add a new node to the end is a one yeah

234
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
add a new node to the end is a one yeah
 

235
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,189
add a new node to the end is a one yeah
we just

236
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
we just
 

237
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,909
we just
have to because the link never changed

238
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
have to because the link never changed
 

239
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,070
have to because the link never changed
we just have to allocate one and put it

240
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
we just have to allocate one and put it
 

241
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,110
we just have to allocate one and put it
to to obtain attach it to the end right

242
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
to to obtain attach it to the end right
 

243
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,870
to to obtain attach it to the end right
yes and then we but

244
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
yes and then we but
 

245
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,670
yes and then we but
so if you are given this head head of

246
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
so if you are given this head head of
 

247
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,230
so if you are given this head head of
the link

248
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
the link
 

249
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,350
the link
yeah it takes on time to travel

250
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
yeah it takes on time to travel
 

251
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,150
yeah it takes on time to travel
to travel in a linked list right yeah

252
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
to travel in a linked list right yeah
 

253
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,270
to travel in a linked list right yeah
because you have to start from the

254
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
because you have to start from the
 

255
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,710
because you have to start from the
beginning and then you follow one step

256
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
beginning and then you follow one step
 

257
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,909
beginning and then you follow one step
every time to find

258
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
every time to find
 

259
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,110
every time to find
the end okay

260
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
the end okay
 

261
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,590
the end okay
yeah okay so now let's let's try this

262
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
yeah okay so now let's let's try this
 

263
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,310
yeah okay so now let's let's try this
class

264
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
class
 

265
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,310
class
so so look link list

266
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
so so look link list
 

267
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,310
so so look link list
so link list we we have note yeah we

268
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
so link list we we have note yeah we
 

269
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,590
so link list we we have note yeah we
define a note yeah

270
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
define a note yeah
 

271
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,350
define a note yeah
so class why is class object templates

272
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
so class why is class object templates
 

273
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,550
so class why is class object templates
so it defines how we create new objects

274
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
so it defines how we create new objects
 

275
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,150
so it defines how we create new objects
class note see what's what's really

276
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
class note see what's what's really
 

277
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,270
class note see what's what's really
supposed to be missing yes and i will

278
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
supposed to be missing yes and i will
 

279
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:54,070
supposed to be missing yes and i will
define the constructor

280
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080

 

281
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,990

of the class the first parameter is

282
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
of the class the first parameter is
 

283
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,510
of the class the first parameter is
usually safe

284
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
usually safe
 

285
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,430
usually safe
okay so it means that this this message

286
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
okay so it means that this this message
 

287
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,670
okay so it means that this this message
belongs to the class and i know that

288
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
belongs to the class and i know that
 

289
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,590
belongs to the class and i know that
the value means that we can hold any

290
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
the value means that we can hold any
 

291
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,629
the value means that we can hold any
type of value and then we can point

292
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
type of value and then we can point
 

293
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,749
type of value and then we can point
next no or just next yeah next and then

294
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
next no or just next yeah next and then
 

295
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,189
next no or just next yeah next and then
default by default if we not specify

296
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
default by default if we not specify
 

297
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,670
default by default if we not specify
anything we just specify it as a noun

298
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
anything we just specify it as a noun
 

299
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,270
anything we just specify it as a noun
default value because it's pointing to

300
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
default value because it's pointing to
 

301
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,469
default value because it's pointing to
nothing at the beginning

302
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
nothing at the beginning
 

303
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,270
nothing at the beginning
unless we specified what a note and then

304
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
unless we specified what a note and then
 

305
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,309
unless we specified what a note and then
we can say

306
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
we can say
 

307
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,590
we can say
we can add a self dot yeah we're using

308
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
we can add a self dot yeah we're using
 

309
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,430
we can add a self dot yeah we're using
this set selector value we

310
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
this set selector value we
 

311
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,189
this set selector value we
given a new attribute to value and then

312
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
given a new attribute to value and then
 

313
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,790
given a new attribute to value and then
save next

314
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
save next
 

315
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,909
save next
equals next okay

316
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
equals next okay
 

317
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,629
equals next okay
so let's see let's see defining the

318
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
so let's see let's see defining the
 

319
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,710
so let's see let's see defining the
class in python is very similar yeah you

320
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
class in python is very similar yeah you
 

321
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,189
class in python is very similar yeah you
just have

322
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
just have
 

323
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,150
just have
this class and this is constructed in

324
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
this class and this is constructed in
 

325
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,230
this class and this is constructed in
double uh underscore underscore in

326
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
double uh underscore underscore in
 

327
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,710
double uh underscore underscore in
initialization yeah initialization means

328
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
initialization yeah initialization means
 

329
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,990
initialization yeah initialization means
that when the

330
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
that when the
 

331
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,110
that when the
class is initialized is created

332
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
class is initialized is created
 

333
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,430
class is initialized is created
okay now we do this we allocate we

334
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
okay now we do this we allocate we
 

335
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,870
okay now we do this we allocate we
allocate two attributes

336
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
allocate two attributes
 

337
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,749
allocate two attributes
by given a parameter so so now we can

338
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
by given a parameter so so now we can
 

339
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,469
by given a parameter so so now we can
just do this

340
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
just do this
 

341
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,710
just do this
we can just know we can just like uh the

342
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
we can just know we can just like uh the
 

343
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,230
we can just know we can just like uh the
first node head

344
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
first node head
 

345
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,950
first node head
and we can say node we can just use it

346
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
and we can say node we can just use it
 

347
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,710
and we can say node we can just use it
node minus one okay

348
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
node minus one okay
 

349
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,950
node minus one okay
so it means that we create after this

350
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
so it means that we create after this
 

351
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,390
so it means that we create after this
we're creating a node

352
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
we're creating a node
 

353
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,510
we're creating a node
with the value minus one but the next

354
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
with the value minus one but the next
 

355
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,430
with the value minus one but the next
next pointer is none right because if

356
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
next pointer is none right because if
 

357
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,629
next pointer is none right because if
you yeah

358
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
you yeah
 

359
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,950
you yeah
because we we are not given anything the

360
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
because we we are not given anything the
 

361
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,870
because we we are not given anything the
second parameter and then d4 by before

362
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
second parameter and then d4 by before
 

363
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,510
second parameter and then d4 by before
is nine

364
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
is nine
 

365
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,790
is nine
p equals yeah

366
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
p equals yeah
 

367
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,589
p equals yeah
yeah so now we can define another one

368
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
yeah so now we can define another one
 

369
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,790
yeah so now we can define another one
called defined

370
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
called defined
 

371
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,550
called defined
at next x and and a node

372
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
at next x and and a node
 

373
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,550
at next x and and a node
and a node okay net self value

374
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
and a node okay net self value
 

375
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,309
and a node okay net self value
okay then we can say we if we enter node

376
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
okay then we can say we if we enter node
 

377
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,749
okay then we can say we if we enter node
so now what can we what what does it

378
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
so now what can we what what does it
 

379

mean
 

381
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,390
mean
it means that we add a method and then

382
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
it means that we add a method and then
 

383
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,869
it means that we add a method and then
we allocate a create a new node and put

384
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
we allocate a create a new node and put
 

385
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,510
we allocate a create a new node and put
it to the

first of all we create a node we have
 

495
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,110
first of all we create a node we have
created now which is minus one yeah

496
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
created now which is minus one yeah
 

497
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,750

00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
and now we we save this p here right
 

503
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,470
and now we we save this p here right
p is pointing to at least and then p

504
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
p is pointing to at least and then p
 

505
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,670
p is pointing to at least and then p
at node i this will be 0 to

506
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
at node i this will be 0 to
 

507
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,030
at node i this will be 0 to
1 2 3 to 9 right yeah

508
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
1 2 3 to 9 right yeah
 

509
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,150
1 2 3 to 9 right yeah
what it does is every time i create a

510
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
what it does is every time i create a
 

511
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,030
what it does is every time i create a
note with this

512
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
note with this
 

513
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,829
note with this
value zero one two three yeah and i put

514
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
value zero one two three yeah and i put
 

515
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,710
value zero one two three yeah and i put
i put it here

516
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
i put it here
 

517
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,269
i put it here
this is now i i'm zero yeah and then

518
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
this is now i i'm zero yeah and then
 

519
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:07,910
this is now i i'm zero yeah and then
this p

520
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920
this p
 

521
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,430
this p
at link to it and then p now moves to

522
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
at link to it and then p now moves to
 

523
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,230
at link to it and then p now moves to
here and then

524
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
here and then
 

525
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,590
here and then
one i create a node one and i link to it

526
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
one i create a node one and i link to it
 

527
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,990
one i create a node one and i link to it
and now p moves to here yeah so

528
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
and now p moves to here yeah so
 

529
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,509
and now p moves to here yeah so
eventually there will be a link

530
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
eventually there will be a link
 

531
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,710
eventually there will be a link
minus one zero one two three four

532
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
minus one zero one two three four
 

533
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,389
minus one zero one two three four
five yeah to nine okay and now

534
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
five yeah to nine okay and now
 

535
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,590
five yeah to nine okay and now
p equals hat head is here yeah p head is

536
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
p equals hat head is here yeah p head is
 

537
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,710
p equals hat head is here yeah p head is
here

538
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
here
 

539
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,670
here
p equals hat so p pointing to here and

540
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
p equals hat so p pointing to here and
 

541
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,550
p equals hat so p pointing to here and
now y p

542
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
now y p
 

543
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,110
now y p
is not reaching the end we put the p the

544
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
is not reaching the end we put the p the
 

545
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,870
is not reaching the end we put the p the
value so which is minus one

546
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
value so which is minus one
 

547
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,670
value so which is minus one
p equals p dot x and then move the p to

548
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
p equals p dot x and then move the p to
 

549
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,509
p equals p dot x and then move the p to
the next yeah

550
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
the next yeah
 

551
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,990
the next yeah
and then move it to the left window so

552
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
and then move it to the left window so
 

553
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,750
and then move it to the left window so
it just follows the linked list

554
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:47,760
it just follows the linked list
 

555
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,230
it just follows the linked list
follows the note in the linked list yeah

556
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
follows the note in the linked list yeah
 

557
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,430
follows the note in the linked list yeah
correct

558
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
correct
 

559
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,629
correct
what's the time complexity

560
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
what's the time complexity
 

561
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,110
what's the time complexity
yeah if this is n then that's our n

562
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
yeah if this is n then that's our n
 

563
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,550
yeah if this is n then that's our n
right okay because

564
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
right okay because
 

565
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,629
right okay because
we are following we are creating the sp

566
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639
we are following we are creating the sp
 

567
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,069
we are following we are creating the sp
what's the space complexity

568
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
what's the space complexity
 

569
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,870
what's the space complexity
how much space do we need if that's n

570
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
how much space do we need if that's n
 

571
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,990
how much space do we need if that's n
then we'll be

572
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
then we'll be
 

573
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,030
then we'll be
on one and

574
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
on one and
 

575
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,949
on one and
and because we are we are obviously

576
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
and because we are we are obviously
 

577
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,629
and because we are we are obviously
allocating the space for each now so

578
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
allocating the space for each now so
 

579
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,430
allocating the space for each now so
let's all n

580
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
let's all n
 

581
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,110
let's all n
right yeah so let's take some

582
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
right yeah so let's take some
 

583
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,110
right yeah so let's take some
connectivity and uh time complexity is

584
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
connectivity and uh time complexity is
 

585
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,230
connectivity and uh time complexity is
also om

586
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
also om
 

587
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,910
also om
it always works yes so this is quite

588
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
it always works yes so this is quite
 

589
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,829
it always works yes so this is quite
interesting yeah you see this is another

590
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
interesting yeah you see this is another
 

591
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,829
interesting yeah you see this is another
data structure i created

592
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
data structure i created
 

593
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,790
data structure i created
a note a chain you can imagine that's a

594
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
a note a chain you can imagine that's a
 

595
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,829
a note a chain you can imagine that's a
chain yeah

596
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:31,839
chain yeah
 

597
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,110
chain yeah
and i link it together okay yeah link it

598
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
and i link it together okay yeah link it
 

599
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,420
and i link it together okay yeah link it
together
