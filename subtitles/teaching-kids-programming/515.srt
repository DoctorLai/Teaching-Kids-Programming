1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:09,200
hello mr missouri right yeah okay

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,120
2 to the power of 0 what's the 1

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,200
2 to the power 1 2

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,440
2 to the power 2 4

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,920
2 to the power of 10

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,920
20.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,640
[Music]

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,400
come on you need to remember this number

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,199
because that's very special in in

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,160
computer science is it

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,560
256

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,599
256 no

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,960
8

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,320
16

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,280
32

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,160
64

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,040
128

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,520
256 512

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,520
and what's next

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,480
yeah this number is very important 1024

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,199
because in computer science it's binary

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,440
and 2 to the power of 10 yeah 10 24. if

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,800
you talk about 1024 people know okay

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,600
you're a programmer you're a software

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,800
engineer right because it's uh it has

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,559
this special meaning for programmers and

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,159
you know in computer science

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,840
yes i think i don't think people think

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,720
they'll program it because like

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,080
oh um

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,320
why why

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,080
yeah because because i have a hair

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,000
another one is like if you say oh i have

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,630
1024 half

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,759
yeah

36
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,080
[Music]

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,960
okay okay a to the power of b we know

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,079
yeah is that a times a times a

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,479
how many a's b b times a yeah

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,280
a to the power of zero equals one where

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,439
a is not equal to zero zero to the power

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,360
of zero mathematically no different not

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,360
valid okay that's a very special case

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,240
good question so one zero what's this

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,360
zero to the power of

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,560
a

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,200
where

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,680
where a is not equal to zero equals zero

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
right zero times zero times zero times

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,360
zero a million zero times to get a

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,280
square here am i

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,000
okay

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,079
what space i know

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,360
mass

55
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,080
m a

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,480
t h s okay yeah

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,000
okay okay so today's question very

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,040
simple

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,640
given a number like uh two four

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,879
ones you know

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,400
can you rearrange these digits to make

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,319
it a power of uh two two out of yeah

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,200
yeah okay how about

64
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,840
two zero five six can we rearrange the

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,040
numbers too yes yes it's already in it

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,040
no no one yes yes why what zero two five

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,200
okay but we don't want to be in zero

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,120
because matching is

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,840
there's no leading zero in front of

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,840
other teaching people

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,519
okay

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,720
so another example 46

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,000
can we

74
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,840
uh yeah six people okay

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,680
yellow

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,720
um

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:12,319
no no no one

78
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:13,519
[Music]

79
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
okay so

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,599
you get this question yeah so we want to

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,599
rearrange the numbers to find out if it

82
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,200
can be a power to power 2

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,920
and when rearranging the numbers we

84
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,080
don't want the leading zeros okay so how

85
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,360
do we do it all right how do we do it

86
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,200
come on let's see

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,680
yeah yeah i'm not erasing that okay come

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,000
on okay how do we do this

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
numbers

90
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,130
close

91
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,570
close up

92
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:48,900
[Laughter]

93
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,900
[Music]

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,120
so i mean what's your source how do we

95
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,159
solve this problem if we're given an

96
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,159
integer positive okay positive integer

97
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,319
positive integer how do we know if it

98
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,110
can be a power of two if we are

99
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,120
arranging a digit

100
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,200
[Music]

101
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,000
is a good start what's how do we perform

102
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,879
we check every possibility

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,120
46 how do we know if it's a it's a hot

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,120
pot

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,120
yeah

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,520
i mean what's this 46 and 64. what are

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,800
those two if we launch this

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,000
the same

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,160
what's what do we call it

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,479
what's this one two three

111
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,440
one three two two one three two three

112
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,840
one three one two one four two one okay

113
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,720
what's this permutation permutations yes

114
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,560
permutations we talk about the

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,199
permutation you say

116
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,639
one one one given a n

117
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,120
element

118
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,759
yeah if a string has n elements or an

119
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,560
array have an enemy what's the number of

120
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,560
uh

121
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,320
permutations the full permutation what's

122
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,919
the computation what's this look there

123
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,080
are three numbers here how many

124
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,919
permutations of these

125
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,320
six if we have four numbers so what's

126
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,560
the number of total communication

127
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,560
if there are four numbers three twenty

128
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,280
four yes

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,960
another five five

130
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,880
twenty four times five equals one

131
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,199
hundred twenty yeah so what's this

132
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,280
what's this smart

133
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,840
24 120

134
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,360
624

135
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,919
120 720 what do we call these numbers

136
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,919
triangle numbers no

137
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:37,039
one times two two one times numbers six

138
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,800
what's this number time no no no what's

139
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,919
this what's this factorial factorial yes

140
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,680
factory

141
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,680
how do we come up with this factorial

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,560
how do we know it's a factory number

143
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,639
here

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,039
the first element we have n choice the

145
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,680
second element we have m is one choice

146
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,440
the third element we have at minus two

147
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
and the last animal we have one choice

148
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,000
so let's n factorial

149
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,000
yeah okay

150
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,759
here's a real spider

151
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
okay

152
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,639
it's green yes so it just

153
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,199
it has hair dye

154
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,560
one two three four five six seven eight

155
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,479
okay

156
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,720
come on can we just uh continue the

157
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,759
lessons please come on man

158
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
please

159
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,280
okay let's see

160
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,360
can i have your pen please

161
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,400
okay this is not actually not a plan

162
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,880
this is called

163
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,880
markers

164
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,440
it's like marcus okay

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the full communication we know is

166
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,440
antarctica

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,039
yeah

168
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,960
permutation like what's the difference

169
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,479
between permutation and

170
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,319
coordination

171
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,360
yeah combination

172
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,280
combination is

173
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,360
okay so permutation yeah one two three

174
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,000
we know there are six yeah one two three

175
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,960
one three two two one three two three

176
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,440
one three one two three two one

177
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,440
combination

178
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,000
one two three

179
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
kicking two

180
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,080
one two one three

181
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,639
two three

182
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,039
one two is the same as two one one three

183
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,960
is the seventh three one three two

184
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,280
is the same as two three

185
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,520
now that two three two three okay

186
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,440
so you see the difference

187
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,319
this one permutation

188
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,560
the sequence matter the combination the

189
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,160
sequence do not matter three uppers

190
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,639
picking two

191
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,199
how many ways three three ways

192
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,599
one two one three picking one

193
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,540
two is the same as speaking to one

194
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,080
the combinations

195
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,840
[Music]

196
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,000
and we use the p and c right p and c

197
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,919
picking two apples out of three is the

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,199
same as picking one apples out of three

199
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,599
i'm right look

200
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,680
if you pick one two you have three if if

201
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,599
you pick one three you have two if you

202
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,599
peel one two three you have one right

203
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,319
it's the same

204
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,280
so

205
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,639
we can generalize this speaking m out of

206
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,360
n is the same thing as picking n minus m

207
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,080
out of n all right

208
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,840
c

209
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,319
p permutation

210
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,639
permutation is a sequence so if we pick

211
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,280
the items using the combination we have

212
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,360
to do this full permutation of these two

213
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,840
items all right so look if we pick these

214
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,199
two items and then we do this uh

215
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,760
permutation

216
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,479
full permutation of these two items then

217
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,880
we can get this permutation right so

218
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:44,320
picking m i 10 out of n is the same as

219
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,120
first of all we pick m items out of n

220
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,920
and then we do this for permutation of

221
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,040
this right and then we know p

222
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,200
a a is the same as a factorial right

223
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,440
yeah there are three efforts how many

224
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,839
ways to rearrange that

225
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,160
six ways

226
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,200
five apples how many ways to rearrange

227
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,600
them different orders

228
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,040
quick mess come on five five factorial

229
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
120

230
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,600
100 a million

231
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,560
twenty spaghetti

232
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,320
t

233
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,240
n m

234
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,120
on the number of ways the antaction

235
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,360
divided by n minus n factorial and then

236
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,320
c n m is

237
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,200
n factorial divided by n minus m

238
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,200
factorial and divided by m factorial

239
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,200
because we have to divide the m

240
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,240
saturated for communication for each

241
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,800
group

242
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,519
and on day one on one we talk about

243
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,160
recursive arguments to generate the full

244
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,399
permutation okay so the idea is that

245
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,399
look one two three four and here and

246
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,480
there an item we want to do is a

247
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,600
recursive communication agreement how to

248
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,160
do it so first of all look

249
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,519
for first one we we can replace it with

250
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,040
other right

251
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,279
these could be

252
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,120
in the first place and also the one

253
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,880
could be in the first place for example

254
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,279
if three can be in the first place then

255
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,320
we swap it so we stop it it becomes

256
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,399
three

257
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,519
and one and then we can do this full

258
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,200
permutation on the smaller size problem

259
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,800
and then after that we can swap it back

260
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,040
okay

261
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,640
the time conduction for that is because

262
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,160
there are n items

263
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,480
for pigmentation and factor define

264
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,440
per mutation term

265
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,200
hey

266
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,320
this is the index

267
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,200
index

268
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:36,640
to the end and we have current numbers

269
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,240
so if we are reaching the end

270
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,240
if we reaching we end and we have a

271
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
solution we have solution when we can

272
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,480
yeah

273
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,640
yeah what's here promise i give you that

274
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,200
when we have it i'll give you that yes

275
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,519
yes num

276
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:58,240
okay or for i in range

277
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,240
we start with k to the end length nums

278
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,720
now we need to swap yes look num

279
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,120
i and nums

280
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,320
okay equals num

281
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,160
okay num right we need to hear from

282
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,800
right yeah from this is a very magic

283
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
keyword recursive year from

284
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,440
yeah from

285
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,800
term

286
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,800
okay here from k plus one

287
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,560
and then we need to do this again to

288
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,360
swap it back

289
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,720
so look this is the how we implement the

290
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,560
permutation

291
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,160
and we also talked about combination and

292
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,480
some some other days

293
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,800
but in python we don't need to reinvent

294
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,120
the wheel okay instead we use this

295
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,279
package from

296
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,880
eater tour

297
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,920
we use lots of function from this

298
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,480
package

299
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,480
import

300
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,880
permutation

301
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,079
per

302
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,079
mu

303
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,680
tations

304
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,680
and all combination right combination

305
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,760
and that's it then we can use this

306
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,959
permutation how do we use the

307
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,440
permutation

308
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,560
permutation is the iterator so if a

309
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,160
equals one two three right and if we say

310
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,959
permutations

311
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,600
a then you will return an iterator one

312
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,440
two three one three two so your iterator

313
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,760
okay iterator of one two three

314
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,440
one three two

315
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,720
etc okay

316
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,880
for p in permutations a then

317
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,320
p will become the topper of one two

318
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,760
three one three two those kind of thing

319
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,639
so it's very convenient for us

320
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,240
combination for example like for x in

321
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,880
combination a

322
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,600
comma two so we're picking two out items

323
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,760
out of a then you return one two one

324
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,160
three two three okay so coming back to

325
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,880
this question all we have to do is to do

326
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,320
this permutation on the digit right

327
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,920
yeah we do this communication with

328
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,639
bitches and i'll find out if it's a

329
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,959
power of two all right so look we can

330
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,000
just do this for

331
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,360
a

332
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,920
in

333
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,480
permutation from italy's import

334
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,279
permutation from permutation

335
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,360
permutations

336
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,639
and str the number is n right

337
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,639
so now a

338
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,040
yeah we're converting the integer to

339
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,279
string and we do the permutation

340
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,040
this is to permutate to do the

341
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,680
permutation of the digit right if n is

342
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,920
is one two three okay and then a would

343
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,760
be one three two one two three thousand

344
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,760
thing and that's six right

345
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,519
a then we want to check if a is the

346
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,500
power of two how do we check if a number

347
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,880
is a power of two

348
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,600
[Music]

349
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,120
how do we check how do we know that 64

350
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,519
is the power too

351
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,800
how do we know 120 a is power how do we

352
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,839
do because

353
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,920
we

354
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,560
divided by 2

355
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,560
and divided by

356
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,600
divided by 2 divided by 2 divided by 2

357
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,680
and here it can't be divided by 2 right

358
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,240
or it's 1 right if it's 1 then we know

359
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,279
it's power 2 let's one another way we go

360
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,800
on the calculator and times two we talk

361
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,800
to until we get that number

362
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,079
and if it's

363
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
if they skip it

364
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,240
the number is not

365
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,680
that's that's good yeah so this real

366
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,040
reverse way you're talking about

367
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:23,600
dividing right 64 divided by 2 32 16 a 4

368
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,160
2 1. okay once you've got one it's a

369
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,560
total of two right another example

370
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,560
is 6 power 2

371
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,720
6 divided by two three three cannot be

372
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,639
divided two and it's not one so it's not

373
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,399
divided by two right and you're talking

374
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,279
about the other way one

375
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,320
two

376
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,279
four

377
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,480
eight sixteen thirty two sixty four okay

378
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:48,959
we got this okay how about 65 is it uh

379
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:52,079
no okay 64 times 2 128 is bigger than 65

380
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,240
so no right that's one way but if it's a

381
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,839
power of two then we can do something

382
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,600
special because finally one in binary

383
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,320
zero one is

384
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,240
one right this is the decimal this one

385
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,320
and binary this is one

386
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,079
how about two

387
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,760
two is one zero

388
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,600
four

389
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,880
one zero zero eight one zero zero zero

390
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,839
sixteen

391
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,480
one zero zero zero zero thirty two

392
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,360
one zero zero zero zero zero you see in

393
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,680
binary we only have one and zero and if

394
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,120
the power of two is one followed by some

395
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,720
zeros i'm right

396
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,519
so we just have to check if it's this

397
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,360
format right yes yeah so look if it is

398
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,720
minus 1 what happened look if it is

399
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,959
minus 1

400
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,399
if it's power 2 minus 1

401
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,800
1 1 1 1 1 if it is minus one one one one

402
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,959
one if it is minus one one one one

403
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,920
one one one

404
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,680
zero

405
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,839
definitely

406
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,519
well ten minus one does not equal one

407
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,839
no this is binary

408
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,519
binary okay in mathematics binary if we

409
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,600
want to check an integer if it's a power

410
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,600
of 2 we can use if this is n we can do

411
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,160
this n bigger than

412
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,079
uh if it's n bigger than zero

413
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,600
also and

414
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,920
n and

415
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,320
n minus one

416
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,120
yeah it needs to be zero right because

417
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,279
in finally one zero zero zero we

418
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,519
subtract one now becomes zero one one

419
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,759
one if we do the n

420
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,000
cl and one zero zero and one zero zero

421
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,399
and one zero one and zero zero

422
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,079
right so we can do this

423
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,160
another way

424
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,399
yeah we can do the log function right we

425
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,720
lock the function if we look to master

426
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,399
log two n

427
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,600
and if this is a whole number right yeah

428
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,120
log 2

429
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,800
64.

430
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,920
what's this 2 to the power of something

431
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,480
equals 64. how many times or two

432
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,480
look at 6 7

433
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,480
4.

434
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,600
64. so how many

435
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,679
six

436
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,000
six yeah so this has to be a whole

437
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,439
number right yeah so we just have to

438
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,520
check if this is the whole number how do

439
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,120
we check the number is the whole number

440
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,039
so we can do this n dot is integer wow

441
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,079
so simple yeah we can just use this

442
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,959
method

443
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,079
right or if we can do this convert it to

444
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,880
integer

445
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,760
log to n right and then we times it back

446
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,679
so 2 to the power of these means equal

447
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,720
to n right

448
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,480
2 to the power of 6 is 64. so this

449
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,880
number could be a whole number or could

450
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,720
be some fraction number flow number like

451
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,600
3.5 right

452
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,240
if

453
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,640
2 to the power 3.5 decimal you could

454
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,160
have decimals then we can double check

455
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
we can check it back

456
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,280
but the most efficient way is this this

457
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,679
method

458
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,000
right yeah because it's just using the

459
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,160
bit this is finally it only works for

460
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,360
binary uh if we want to check the number

461
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,120
is the power of two okay so we can

462
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,480
iterate this number

463
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,679
the digit we just check if this a

464
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,919
we need to check if this a

465
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,600
not b zero right we don't want a leading

466
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,880
zero right

467
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,960
and also we can use the method bin if we

468
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,440
convert it b list a but a is a iterator

469
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,640
a topper we need to join it okay x

470
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,440
equals

471
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,720
dot john what's john eric john a let's

472
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,280
join

473
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,240
split we're done opposite sleep okay so

474
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,600
look one two three don't split

475
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,559
uh one two

476
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,919
two

477
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,919
three if we just split

478
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:47,760
spray comma that would give us a one

479
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,799
two

480
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,679
three right

481
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,679
yeah

482
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,960
and then the opposite way we just do

483
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,840
this uh comma dot join

484
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,760
john putting things together as a string

485
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,440
as it's a string then we need to check

486
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,000
if x yellow

487
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,799
not equals zero

488
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,799
right and

489
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,120
and

490
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,000
we just need to check if x is a power of

491
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,080
two then we can uh first of all we can

492
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,120
do this y equals

493
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,320
uh integer of x and

494
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
and y

495
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,080
and

496
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,760
y minus one equal to zero right we can

497
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,360
use this of

498
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,360
y is integer

499
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,919
or

500
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,919
into y log 2 y

501
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,799
uh actually no that's actually it's this

502
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,160
one dot is integer

503
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,160
or

504
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,559
or we can convert these and two to the

505
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,480
power of left equals y okay

506
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,280
another way would be to use the pin

507
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,039
function being

508
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,039
15 and that will give us a string zero b

509
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,640
one one one one you'll convert integer

510
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,120
to a binary and then we just have the

511
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,320
call list if it only has one one right

512
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,679
bin

513
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,919
bin

514
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,919
x

515
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,720
one

516
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,120
needs to be one right

517
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,960
in binary you can only have one one all

518
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,640
right yeah

519
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,679
so the time complexity for this one a

520
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,799
little bit tricky okay computation if

521
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,159
the integers n how many bits is log two

522
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,080
bits

523
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,000
like two bits

524
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,240
and then we do this four communication

525
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
is bacteria

526
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,159
and for each one we need to check if

527
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,039
it's a it's a power of two and that

528
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,360
needs to come not to n okay

529
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,280
if this n is uh with a range bigger than

530
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,200
zero is smaller than

531
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,760
10 to the power of nine one followed by

532
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,039
nine zero is smaller than two to the

533
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,360
power of 32 right yeah we can use the

534
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,159
counter for

535
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,640
i

536
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,640
in range

537
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,760
32 okay

538
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,000
c equals counter we're going to count

539
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,880
one str

540
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,159
one

541
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,159
shifter shift i

542
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,200
uh 31 actually so this is actually we

543
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,840
are checking 2 to the power 1 2 to the

544
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,159
power of 2 2 to the power 0

545
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,600
2 to the power 3 etc and then we get

546
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,240
this number here

547
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,080
which is 1 2 4 8

548
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,919
16 32 and then we convert it to a string

549
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,559
right convert it to a string

550
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,799
and then we counter we counter we make

551
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,559
it count that we cut the digit

552
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,679
now we just have to compare if this is

553
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,919
digit

554
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:42,640
if c equal equal counter

555
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,640
counter lambda n right str and

556
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
then return true

557
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,240
otherwise return first

558
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,760
okay but this one we can move it outside

559
00:21:52,240 --> 00:22:00,400
okay for example 46 right one digit four

560
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:03,440
ones six ones now if we iterate chicken

561
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,120
bees eat away chicken b 64 and then we

562
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,240
find out okay

563
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,120
the digit we are using for 64 is the

564
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,679
same as the digit we are using as 46.

565
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,919
then we have a match right

566
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,400
we can use the any keyword right because

567
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,159
we are trying to find a match so return

568
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,230
any

569
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,400
any what counter str1

570
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,760
[Music]

571
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,840
yeah

572
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,120
equal equal

573
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,840
these

574
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,000
four i in range 31

575
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,320
the time complexity this 31 is a

576
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,120
constant and then this is a constant so

577
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,760
we are actually requiring these

578
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,559
and these so this is log two

579
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,600
there are not two n digits

580
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,000
right

581
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,080
the time the maxi as i said

582
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,960
we are iterating 31 this is a constant

583
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,000
and

584
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,000
we just need to check lock to end digit

585
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,799
and then space complexity the counter

586
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,960
right

587
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,440
so this is more efficient because we

588
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,280
know that n is within a range so then we

589
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,440
can do this 31 here

590
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,640
okay so to sum up what have you learned

591
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,120
what's the problem what have you learned

592
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,120
and that's it

593
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,640
the problem is we have numbers

594
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,120
one by one i'll take you first and then

595
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,840
next time you first so we have numbers

596
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,640
and we want to reorder them to make them

597
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,520
a

598
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,480
power

599
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,640
too

600
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,720
yeah we have a positive integer we want

601
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,039
to find out if we can make it a power of

602
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,200
two by rearranging the numbers

603
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,400
okay okay so what's your solution how do

604
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,400
we do it

605
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
we

606
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,799
communication for permutation that's the

607
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,120
first one the second way is to do it the

608
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,039
other way as long as we know that n is

609
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,559
within range and we have a limited

610
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,799
possibility we just check from the

611
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,799
opposite side the counting and we use a

612
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,799
counter

613
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,679
what's the problem and

614
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,799
there is

615
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,440
a

616
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,440
integer that's an integer and a positive

617
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,320
integer and we want to find

618
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
if

619
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,120
it

620
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,760
is not

621
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,039
if the numbers can be permanent power to

622
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,240
buy

623
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,720
by what

624
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,320
rearranging the digits right and how do

625
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,120
we solve this problem

626
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,600
perforce by permutation of the digit

627
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,440
right and this is the second way is to

628
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,679
go from the other side yeah we just

629
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,559
because n is within a range

630
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,440
so

631
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,120
we can calculate the power of two within

632
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,080
that range and we check

633
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,679
if the digit can be used yeah so this is

634
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,480
for using the counter okay

635
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,480
okay that's it for today bye-bye
