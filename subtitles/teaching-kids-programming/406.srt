1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,720
go

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,359
hello hello everyone

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,680
okay okay too loud okay we got um today

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,920
we're going to talk about something uh

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,240
interesting special it's a turtle

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,280
programming and we know the tattoo yeah

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,000
you know you we have a canvas and then

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,119
we can control we can send a command to

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,480
the turtle

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,920
yeah so

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,240
to do that here we can import so we can

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,480
import front from twitter

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,840
import everything yeah the

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,800
how do we pronounce this this y chart

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,960
star everything it means everything okay

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,559
okay and then we look remember the ft

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,840
for what yeah

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,360
for what

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,280
backwards yeah fd4 for what forward 100

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,200
then you come up with uh

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,320
yeah you see you will come up with the

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,239
these

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,920
uh okay

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:57,120
you come up with list so i just have to

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,120
uh i have to

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,559
okay so i have to make

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,960
change it to these windows to be able to

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,159
capture these okay

29
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,840
uh okay so here ah it's too big okay so

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,240
let's make it here yeah yeah

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,320
okay yeah yeah so you see the

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,680
it's it's drawing a line yeah drawing a

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,080
line that turtle is drawing on the line

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,560
yeah got it yeah

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,360
actually here yeah drawing online

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,759
so uh maybe i'll put it here put it here

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,439
okay so now look

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,159
the turtle is facing right yeah and this

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,720
is yeah and we can ask it to hide it

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,119
height or for high tutor yeah

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,920
ht and then it's gone yeah the opposite

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,720
will be short third st it will be left

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,159
right

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,000
yeah turn left 90 degrees or

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,159
left or

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,439
lt 90 degrees

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,640
uh just

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,560
look at the turtle yeah you'll be

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,040
turning up right

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,840
for what another hundred

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,079
yeah

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,640
okay and there's an a command called

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,239
home so it means that when no matter

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,160
where is the turtle then it will be will

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,239
be sending the turtle home right so if

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,640
we press enter then you'll be going home

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,520
right home is the center right

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,239
yeah

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,040
makes sense okay so we we can set a

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,720
color so let's say we can set a color

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,720
color right so color let's say color red

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,040
and then look the turtle is red now

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,080
right then we can do what we can put a

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,519
circle

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
circle

66
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,720
circle

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,800
it takes one parameter the second

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,480
parameter is optional so let's say

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
circle 100

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,360
so like you will draw a circle

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,680
you see you see the animation right next

72
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,000
circle because we have uh the speed

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,160
let's see the the total of the tether

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,080
speed which is three so we can set it

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,040
too fast let's say we

76
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,120
put it to a fast speed fast and then

77
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,760
let's draw uh

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,000
so what so uh let's kill the screen

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,800
first yeah clear means clear everything

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,879
and then let's do the circle again

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,560
you see is it faster

82
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,920
i don't even see the difference you

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,080
don't see the difference let's see the

84
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,239
speed let's see the speed speed is done

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,440
and let's set the speed to 0 which is

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,519
the 40s

87
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,599
and then let's clear the screen again

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,319
okay then look at the circle look

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,280
instant yeah yeah that's the speed there

90
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,560
species the fast fastest

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,959
okay so now we have talked about

92
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
the basic comments basically we

93
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
we import these commands this is from

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,480
turtle programming the logo right

95
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,760
remember we talked about the logo before

96
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,599
right yeah so we can control uh twitter

97
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,640
to draw on the

98
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,239
canvas and we can we can also set a fear

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,400
uh fear color

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:56,000
i think it's fear color let's say green

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,000
oh for your color feel color maybe

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,720
green

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,400
yeah okay if your color is going without

104
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,120
underscore okay fair color green

105
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,599
then we can begin here

106
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,360
then we can say circle

107
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:17,200
do another smaller one which is 50

108
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,200
okay and then that's the end here

109
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,400
okay now you will feel the last drawing

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,960
shape to green right

111
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,280
got it it's eyeball

112
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,759
oh yeah very creative yes looks like

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,639
okay okay so now let's let's say let's

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,320
say we want to draw a

115
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,199
uh

116
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,919
square with a hundred so how how would

117
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,280
you how would you draw a square

118
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,130
how do you draw a square forward

119
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,639
yeah how would you draw a square uh

120
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,360
[Music]

121
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,520
90 degrees and then we want to report

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,360
repeated four times yeah so remember

123
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,040
this we are in python yeah we are in

124
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
person so basically we can use the

125
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,400
python for loop right right yeah we

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,080
don't have to use the the for loop the

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,479
repeat command in logo remember

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,280
previously we use the repeat in

129
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,320
in in a repeat repeat for this is the

130
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,080
logo command yeah ft 100 rt90 degree

131
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,800
right this is the location

132
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,840
right but instead we don't have a repeat

133
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,479
here but we have a four loop for

134
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,000
underscore in range four right

135
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:30,080
okay then what's ft a hundred

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,039
rt 90 degree okay and then that's it you

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,759
see

138
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,080
nano blue square right yeah and then

139
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,639
look we also sometimes we don't want to

140
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,800
leave the marks for the turtles right so

141
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,759
we want the turtle to be

142
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
to have his feet up so it doesn't leave

143
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,639
any

144
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,600
uh

145
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,800
marks on the canvas so we have a pu pens

146
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,639
up

147
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,400
yeah so let's say clear

148
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,919
first turns out

149
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,039
turns up

150
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,800
okay now ft 100 look it doesn't it

151
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,039
doesn't draw anything

152
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,160
right you skip right because the pens is

153
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,000
up yeah now we we the the opposite is

154
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
pretty sound yeah or pd

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,880
and f300

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,080
yeah

157
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,479
yeah got it

158
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,160
so we can use this to draw a dashed line

159
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,560
right all right

160
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,280
yeah okay let's let's do this

161
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,759
four let's set the color to

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,360
the first color is the color of the pen

163
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,160
the second color is the fear color okay

164
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,400
let's say to black or blue

165
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,639
okay then f4 for in range ten

166
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,880
so what do we want to do so we first of

167
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,319
all we want to paint up

168
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,919
pens up yeah

169
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,919
and then we want to skip

170
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,680
10 we want to skip 10 and then we're

171
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,280
going to punch down

172
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,720
all right then we want to draw another

173
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,160
10. yeah

174
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,840
okay let's see you see you see do we see

175
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,800
a dash line here

176
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
yeah

177
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,720
okay

178
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,199
yeah

179
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,199
yeah make sense

180
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,120
okay okay we talked about the circle

181
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,880
command and circuit command the first

182
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,039
parameter is the size of the circle the

183
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,280
second parameter is the

184
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,680
the how how much uh

185
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,680
how big no no it's the portion of the

186
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
circle you want to draw for

187
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,319
if we don't specify the second parameter

188
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,280
you'll be drawing a whole circle but if

189
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,960
we

190
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,960
let's let's send it to home first okay

191
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
here

192
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,599
let's say if we want to draw a half of

193
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,479
the circle so we say 100 and then 180

194
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,440
because the circle is 360 degree right

195
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,800
so 180 is halfway so look that's a half

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,080
yeah you see

197
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,360
half of it

198
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,759
and i want to

199
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,400
let's okay let's say we want to draw

200
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,840
like three quarters of the circle so

201
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,479
what should i put with the second

202
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,479
parameters

203
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,000
no no half is 180 so 120

204
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,840
i mean three quarters

205
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,440
three

206
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,360
quarters now one quarter is ninety three

207
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,680
quarters is

208
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,000
twenty seventy

209
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,879
yeah three yeah two hundred seventy yeah

210
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,599
okay

211
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,960
yeah okay so this is the circle comma

212
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:17,280
and we can also have uh what we can also

213
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,080
to do something more interesting like

214
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,520
like like what we can draw

215
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,360
a star

216
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,080
yeah do you remember the star

217
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,080
repeat five times

218
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,479
100 but we need to turn

219
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,360
144 degrees and that will give us a star

220
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,039
yeah

221
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,760
yeah

222
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,719
okay make sense

223
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
yeah

224
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,000
so

225
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,240
yeah you can see we can uh what else can

226
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,680
we do i mean but you know we can use the

227
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,399
turtle to draw and then wait a few

228
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,640
intervals yeah we can do this animation

229
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,000
why why because the

230
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,160
uh

231
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,680
that's the speed yeah we show the speed

232
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,920
is let's say to

233
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,279
slow okay so if we say circle 100 then

234
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,360
the the

235
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,120
turtle will be showing the animation

236
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,160
he'll be moving but we can draw

237
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
something

238
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,640
erase something

239
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,800
yeah and then draw another yeah so

240
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,040
another useful command is undo what's

241
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,080
undo mean

242
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,040
uh you undo what you lost yeah yeah look

243
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,120
undo

244
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,720
yeah it's unto okay and then we can do

245
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
another undo

246
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,760
uh one two

247
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,399
and two is it

248
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,440
i know yeah

249
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,360
okay

250
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,240
yeah that's undo okay

251
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,000
so uh probably there's a eraser yeah

252
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,720
we don't have right and another eraser

253
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,720
here okay uh we do do we have a reader

254
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,800
that's interesting probably no we don't

255
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,080
have read okay what else do we have let

256
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,399
me just quickly check okay so

257
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,440
let's say we have uh okay so let's let's

258
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,760
say copy a few commands to see

259
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,120
okay let's see let's copy these copy

260
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,560
these

261
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,440
uh

262
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,279
okay

263
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
what do we have

264
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,760
no no oh

265
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,760
oh

266
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:18,000
oh oh wait wait the

267
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:21,200
program crashed let's launch it again

268
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,160
okay let's launch it again okay

269
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,040
let's see what happened here

270
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,040
make it bigger

271
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,680
so

272
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,399
first of all

273
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,399
let's copy these

274
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,160
what's this let's say from tutor

275
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,880
import everything

276
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,040
color red

277
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,120
yellow the red is the pen of the color

278
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,040
the yellow is the filled color okay so

279
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,640
you give me these

280
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,640
yeah you give me this that's fine

281
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,040
uh

282
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,320
let's move it to the right and then

283
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,880
all right because there's a begin

284
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,760
begin fear

285
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,839
y uh true

286
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,839
let's say fd 200

287
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,399
left

288
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,240
170 degree

289
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,880
if

290
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,240
abs position this is the position if

291
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,760
it's smaller than one now we break

292
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,800
okay

293
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,880
and then

294
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,720
oh oh look it's drawing look look it's

295
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,560
drawing is it drawing

296
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,600
yeah it's in this animation ah that's

297
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,600
why it was stacking for for a while

298
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
dummy

299
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,000
wow you see sorry doing something nice

300
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,639
here so what what commands do we have

301
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,440
her here okay so we can set the

302
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,839
history it's done and we can do what we

303
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,160
can do the end field and let's feel it

304
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,040
and here

305
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,880
okay look look yeah it feels into the

306
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,399
yellow yeah

307
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,600
okay

308
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,880
that one is tiny yeah

309
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,200
okay that one is tiny okay so uh let's

310
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,680
say let's clear it first

311
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,279
and we can set the heading set heading

312
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,360
heading let's say i said heading 90

313
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,160
degree then you would tend to the

314
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,639
string north right it's it's yeah this

315
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,000
is the absolute value so you can say

316
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,360
it's a hundred eight 180 whenever no

317
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,760
matter where your turtle is heading it's

318
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,680
always pointing to the same because that

319
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,519
you turn left and turn right this is

320
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,440
like a relative degree right yeah yeah

321
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,880
because let's say

322
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,360
if you turn left 90 degree what happened

323
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,480
the 90 degree is not the absolute value

324
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,560
all right

325
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,440
do you get it yeah

326
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,399
okay

327
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,279
so what what else do we have uh

328
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,760
pen up and down pen size installed reset

329
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,920
clear yeah we have a reset what's reset

330
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,760
it says set everything to the beginning

331
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,720
so including the color yeah the coloring

332
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,959
is being reset

333
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,959
uh

334
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,880
yeah okay

335
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,079
so any questions so far

336
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,680
okay you can

337
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,279
you can

338
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,720
look backwards 100 yeah backward 100 is

339
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,480
the same as forward minus 100 yeah it

340
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,120
