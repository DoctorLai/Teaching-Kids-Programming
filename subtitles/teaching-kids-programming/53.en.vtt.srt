15
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,870
so today we'll talk about uh we're still
talking about a link list remember we

16
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:18,880
talking about a link list remember we
 

17
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,630
talking about a link list remember we
have talked about reading business

18
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,640
have talked about reading business
 

19
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,990
have talked about reading business
what's the link list

20
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000

 

21
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,830

on this part but it's consists of notes

22
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
on this part but it's consists of notes
 

23
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,589
on this part but it's consists of notes
connecting to each other right

24
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
connecting to each other right
 

25
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,870
connecting to each other right
yes yes and now we have a head head

26
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
yes yes and now we have a head head
 

27
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,150
yes yes and now we have a head head
head can you sit down please

28
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160

 

29
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,310

the most important thing about english

30
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
the most important thing about english
 

31
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,990
the most important thing about english
is that it does not support

32
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
is that it does not support
 

33
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,229
is that it does not support
the random access it means if i want to

34
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
the random access it means if i want to
 

35
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,510
the random access it means if i want to
take a visit this

36
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
take a visit this
 

37
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,830
take a visit this
note yeah you have to follow it from my

38
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
note yeah you have to follow it from my
 

39
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,229
note yeah you have to follow it from my
head yeah work one by one okay

40
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
head yeah work one by one okay
 

41
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,910
head yeah work one by one okay
yes one by one

42
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:53,920

 

43
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,029

okay so how about giving you a head

44
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039
okay so how about giving you a head
 

45
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,869
okay so how about giving you a head
and okay so this cake

46
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
and okay so this cake
 

47
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,229
and okay so this cake
is smaller than all equal than the

48
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
is smaller than all equal than the
 

49
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,710
is smaller than all equal than the
length of the link list okay

50
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
length of the link list okay
 

51
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,390
length of the link list okay
it's for sure linguist

52
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,400

 

53
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,750

and what i want you to do is to

54
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
and what i want you to do is to
 

55
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,510
and what i want you to do is to
return the k last note for example if k

56
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
return the k last note for example if k
 

57
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,670
return the k last note for example if k
equals

58
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
equals
 

59
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,950
equals
what if k equals 2 then i want you to

60
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
what if k equals 2 then i want you to
 

61
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,230
what if k equals 2 then i want you to
return this now if k

62
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
return this now if k
 

63
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,429
return this now if k
is 3 i wanted to return this stuff

64
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
is 3 i wanted to return this stuff
 

65
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,630
is 3 i wanted to return this stuff
so do you understand what i'm talking

66
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
so do you understand what i'm talking
 

67
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,109
so do you understand what i'm talking
about if k is one i want to start from

68
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
about if k is one i want to start from
 

69
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:31,590
about if k is one i want to start from
the

70
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
the
 

71
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,069
the
end no but you can't access the n you

72
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
end no but you can't access the n you
 

73
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,630
end no but you can't access the n you
can only

74
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
can only
 

75
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,469
can only
you're only given the head yeah

76
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
you're only given the head yeah
 

77
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,510
you're only given the head yeah
so think about it is it easy to do

78
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
so think about it is it easy to do
 

79
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,789
so think about it is it easy to do
the thing is you only give it ahead yeah

80
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
the thing is you only give it ahead yeah
 

81
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,149
the thing is you only give it ahead yeah
and the head starts at the beginning

82
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
and the head starts at the beginning
 

83
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,789
and the head starts at the beginning
yes start with the beginning remember we

84
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
yes start with the beginning remember we
 

85
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,830
yes start with the beginning remember we
talk about the

86
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
talk about the
 

87
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,230
talk about the
middle of the linkage remember how do we

88
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
middle of the linkage remember how do we
 

89
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,830
middle of the linkage remember how do we
do it we have a fast

90
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
do it we have a fast
 

91
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,469
do it we have a fast
point and a slow pointer the first trend

92
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
point and a slow pointer the first trend
 

93
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,749
point and a slow pointer the first trend
was twice as fast

94
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
was twice as fast
 

95
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,870
was twice as fast
as first slot so can we

96
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
as first slot so can we
 

97
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,870
as first slot so can we
wait can we do something similar

98
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
wait can we do something similar
 

99
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,710
wait can we do something similar
look we wanted to return the case

100
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
look we wanted to return the case
 

101
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,270
look we wanted to return the case
remember you propose the first solution

102
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
remember you propose the first solution
 

103
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,869
remember you propose the first solution
when we talk about the middle

104
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
when we talk about the middle
 

105
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,990
when we talk about the middle
of the link the first of all is to

106
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
of the link the first of all is to
 

107
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,030
of the link the first of all is to
travel the linked list

108
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
travel the linked list
 

109
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,390
travel the linked list
and then find out how many notes

110
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
and then find out how many notes
 

111
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,030
and then find out how many notes
right so we can compute the language

112
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
right so we can compute the language
 

113
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,750
right so we can compute the language
yeah yeah yeah

114
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
yeah yeah yeah
 

115
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,150
yeah yeah yeah
right first you need to count how many

116
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
right first you need to count how many
 

117
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,830
right first you need to count how many
notes are there

118
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
notes are there
 

119
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,910
notes are there
minus k minus k so for example like two

120
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:35,920
minus k minus k so for example like two
 

121
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,949
minus k minus k so for example like two
four five five five notes and then

122
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
four five five five notes and then
 

123
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,070
four five five five notes and then
the minus two is three so that's one

124
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
the minus two is three so that's one
 

125
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,150
the minus two is three so that's one
two three um

126
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160

 

127
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,790

one two three wait is the first one zero

128
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
one two three wait is the first one zero
 

129
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,110
one two three wait is the first one zero
oh yeah yeah of course yellow if this is

130
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
oh yeah yeah of course yellow if this is
 

131
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,430
oh yeah yeah of course yellow if this is
zero that's one that's two

132
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
zero that's one that's two
 

133
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,470
zero that's one that's two
three four so it depends if if k

134
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
three four so it depends if if k
 

135
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,830
three four so it depends if if k
is two so then i want it to return this

136
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
is two so then i want it to return this
 

137
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,390
is two so then i want it to return this
three right so zero there are five

138
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
three right so zero there are five
 

139
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,750
three right so zero there are five
five notes minus two is three

140
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
five notes minus two is three
 

141
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,270
five notes minus two is three
so look it's three so one

142
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
so look it's three so one
 

143
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,750
so look it's three so one
two three this one means no yeah yeah

144
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
two three this one means no yeah yeah
 

145
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,790
two three this one means no yeah yeah
yeah yeah

146
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
yeah yeah
 

147
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,350
yeah yeah
yeah so generally you travel this once

148
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
yeah so generally you travel this once
 

149
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,149
yeah so generally you travel this once
and then you

150
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
and then you
 

151
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,830
and then you
you compute the the how many nodes and

152
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
you compute the the how many nodes and
 

153
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,360
you compute the the how many nodes and
then you

154
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,370
then you
 

155
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,509
then you
[Music]

156
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
[Music]
 

157
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,390
[Music]
you can uh compute what's the number

158
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
you can uh compute what's the number
 

159
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,949
you can uh compute what's the number
what's the

160
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
what's the
 

161
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,949
what's the
what's the which no is it this case

162
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
what's the which no is it this case
 

163
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,470
what's the which no is it this case
note from the last right yeah can we do

164
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
note from the last right yeah can we do
 

165
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,309
note from the last right yeah can we do
better only travel at once

166
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
better only travel at once
 

167
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:44,830
better only travel at once
can we do better i need traveling once

168
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840

 

169
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,270

yes

170
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280

 

171
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,710

uh

172
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720

 

173
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,070

look how about if i give you a note

174
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
look how about if i give you a note
 

175
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,190
look how about if i give you a note
which travel two step at a time two step

176
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
which travel two step at a time two step
 

177
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,550
which travel two step at a time two step
so one two so now i'm here yeah

178
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
so one two so now i'm here yeah
 

179
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,589
so one two so now i'm here yeah
yeah so and i have another note now

180
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
yeah so and i have another note now
 

181
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,030
yeah so and i have another note now
starts with this

182
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
starts with this
 

183
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,550
starts with this
and then the post travels some distance

184
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
and then the post travels some distance
 

185
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,110
and then the post travels some distance
you see do you get it this one is out

186
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
you see do you get it this one is out
 

187
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,270
you see do you get it this one is out
yeah yeah oh when this is out then this

188
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
yeah yeah oh when this is out then this
 

189
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,629
yeah yeah oh when this is out then this
snow will be there

190
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
snow will be there
 

191
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,550
snow will be there
why is that why is this working

192
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
why is that why is this working
 

193
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,110
why is that why is this working
look what when this when the first note

194
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
look what when this when the first note
 

195
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,469
look what when this when the first note
when the first

196
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
when the first
 

197
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,590
when the first
travels k step right and the second note

198
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
travels k step right and the second note
 

199
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,150
travels k step right and the second note
second pointer starts so what's the

200
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
second pointer starts so what's the
 

201
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,590
second pointer starts so what's the
distance between them

202
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
distance between them
 

203
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,950
distance between them
two two yeah oh yeah yes i wouldn't eat

204
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
two two yeah oh yeah yes i wouldn't eat
 

205
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,550
two two yeah oh yeah yes i wouldn't eat
the first one which is the end

206
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
the first one which is the end
 

207
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,469
the first one which is the end
and what's the second distance what's

208
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
and what's the second distance what's
 

209
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,390
and what's the second distance what's
the second pointer

210
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
the second pointer
 

211
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,110
the second pointer
or b cave right because they are they

212
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
or b cave right because they are they
 

213
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,390
or b cave right because they are they
are distancing

214
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
are distancing
 

215
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,430
are distancing
their distance

216
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440

 

217
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,390

yeah does it make sense yeah yeah very

218
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
yeah does it make sense yeah yeah very
 

219
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,710
yeah does it make sense yeah yeah very
good

220
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
good
 

221
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,320
good
okay

222
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,330

 

223

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,230
[Music]
okay so now let's do this coding first

226
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
okay so now let's do this coding first
 

227
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:20,870
okay so now let's do this coding first
so yeah

228
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880

 

229
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,390

so look we need a k parameter yeah okay

230
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400

 

231
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,950

so so c equals hat

232
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
so so c equals hat
 

233
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,830
so so c equals hat
now it's remaining four i in

234
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840

 

235
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,390

redwater

236
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400

 

237
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,550

you're not guessing range k come on

238
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
you're not guessing range k come on
 

239
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,390
you're not guessing range k come on
what's the range function range k will

240
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
what's the range function range k will
 

241
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,629
what's the range function range k will
be

242
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
be
 

243
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,870
be
zero okay okay again p

244
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
zero okay okay again p
 

245
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,310
zero okay okay again p
equals p dot next

246
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
equals p dot next
 

247
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,350
equals p dot next
right yeah now with key now and then i

248
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
right yeah now with key now and then i
 

249
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,749
right yeah now with key now and then i
have

250
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
have
 

251
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,870
have
another one so y

252
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
another one so y
 

253
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,550
another one so y
y p is still valid then p equals p

254
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
y p is still valid then p equals p
 

255
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,830
y p is still valid then p equals p
dot next and head

256
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
dot next and head
 

257
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,950
dot next and head
equals one head

258
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
equals one head
 

259
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,230
equals one head
equals head downward

260
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
equals head downward
 

261
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,150
equals head downward
they're moving the same right hand next

262
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
they're moving the same right hand next
 

263
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,670
they're moving the same right hand next
right yeah

264
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
right yeah
 

265
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,749
right yeah
and after when this p is the end and

266
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:19,759
and after when this p is the end and
 

267
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,710
and after when this p is the end and
what what's the

268
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
what what's the
 

269
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,430
what what's the
case note return what return

270
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
case note return what return
 

271
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,710
case note return what return
head yes where the return head

272
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
head yes where the return head
 

273
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:39,520
head yes where the return head
okay so let's see what's the complexity

274
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,530

 

275
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:46,830

277
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,309

so yeah so we uh

278
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
so yeah so we uh
 

279
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,749
so yeah so we uh
we talk so we can compute remember we

280
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
we talk so we can compute remember we

of the of the note yeah of the notes so
 

291
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,749
of the of the note yeah of the notes so
how can we

292
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
how can we
 

293
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,110
how can we
how can we compute the the length look

294
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
how can we compute the the length look
 

295
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,950
how can we compute the the length look
yeah lens let's say answer equals

296
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
yeah lens let's say answer equals
 

297
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,270
yeah lens let's say answer equals
but let's do it equal one

298
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
but let's do it equal one

00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
right yeah answer plus equals one
 

303
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,309
right yeah answer plus equals one
that will be zero okay and then head

304
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
that will be zero okay and then head

yeah this is how your calculator length
 

309
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,270
yeah this is how your calculator length
or you

right
yes so what's the length of this is the

342
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
yes so what's the length of this is the
 

343
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,869
yes so what's the length of this is the
length of the one

344
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
length of the one
 

345
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,550
length of the one
one plus this and this lens is

346
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
one plus this and this lens is
 

347
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,909
one plus this and this lens is
the one plus this right do you get it

348
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
the one plus this right do you get it
 

349
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,350
the one plus this right do you get it
yeah do you see i'm seeing it okay

yeah do you see i'm seeing it okay
 

351
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,470
yeah do you see i'm seeing it okay
good so this is the one you know if you

352
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
good so this is the one you know if you
 

353
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,630
good so this is the one you know if you
want to use the better you propose

354

want to use the better you propose
 

355
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,389
want to use the better you propose
you need to calculate the length right

356
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
you need to calculate the length right
 

357
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,910
you need to calculate the length right
and that's the way you calculate the

358
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
and that's the way you calculate the
 

359
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,710
and that's the way you calculate the
lens

look for i in range
 

507
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,150
look for i in range
a how many notes are there nine notes

508
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
a how many notes are there nine notes
 

509
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,030
a how many notes are there nine notes
yeah

510
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
yeah
 

511
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,949
yeah
yeah then k

512
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959

 

513
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,389

k equals k hat uh

514
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
k equals k hat uh
 

515
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,509
k equals k hat uh
we should print the i plus i i okay

516
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
we should print the i plus i i okay
 

517
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:26,069
we should print the i plus i i okay
i

518
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079

 

519
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,790

uh let's do it one two

520
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800

 

521
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,629

ten and then we can print

522
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
ten and then we can print
 

523
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,310
ten and then we can print
between case of value

524
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
between case of value
 

525
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:47,189
between case of value
okay queen let's put the empty line

526
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:47,199

 

527
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,629

you see nine eight seven six five four

528
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
you see nine eight seven six five four
 

529
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,189
you see nine eight seven six five four
three two one so what am i doing here

530
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
three two one so what am i doing here
 

531
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,990
three two one so what am i doing here
so look what am i doing here so is that

532
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
so look what am i doing here so is that
 

533
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,230
so look what am i doing here so is that
i

534
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
i
 

535
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,590
i
get the notes from the last from i to

536
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
get the notes from the last from i to
 

537
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,389
get the notes from the last from i to
i item one to nine right so you

538
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
i item one to nine right so you
 

539
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,389
i item one to nine right so you
basically will print the link this in

540
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
basically will print the link this in
 

541
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,430
basically will print the link this in
reverse order okay and

542
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:09,440
reverse order okay and
 

543
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,230
reverse order okay and
yes yes and then look we can implement

544
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
yes yes and then look we can implement
 

545
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,949
yes yes and then look we can implement
that

546
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
that
 

547
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,389
that

is numb ryan it has in line what should
 

565
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,389
is numb ryan it has in line what should
we return

566
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399
we return
 

567
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,590
we return
zero one zero yeah we're done

568
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
zero one zero yeah we're done
 

569
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,389
zero one zero yeah we're done
and we otherwise we return one plus

570
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
and we otherwise we return one plus
 

571
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,670
and we otherwise we return one plus
because if it look

572
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
because if it look
 

573
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,750
because if it look
length two dot what

574
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
length two dot what
 

575
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,949

happened next you know okay
 

577
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,790
happened next you know okay
so now let's see print

578
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:12,800
so now let's see print
 

579
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,069
so now let's see print
let's print this number okay print

580
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
let's print this number okay print
 

581
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,629
let's print this number okay print
length is

582
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639

 

583
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,189

star lens head

584
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199

 

585
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,670

okay and then let's using this function

586
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
okay and then let's using this function
 

587
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,470
okay and then let's using this function
to print this

588
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
to print this
 

589
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,670
to print this
lens is star lens 2

590
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
lens is star lens 2
 

591
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,110
lens is star lens 2
head you should print the

592
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
head you should print the
 

593
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,629
head you should print the
twice uh which is 10 right

594
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
twice uh which is 10 right
 

595
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,790
twice uh which is 10 right
left or nine nine notes that's it's nine

596
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
left or nine nine notes that's it's nine
 

597
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,069
left or nine nine notes that's it's nine
yes you got it yeah

598
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
yes you got it yeah
 

599
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,389
yes you got it yeah
once you once you have the length then

600
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
once you once you have the length then
 

601
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,990
once you once you have the length then
you can substitute

602
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
you can substitute
 

603
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,389
you can substitute
subject with k and then you can follow

604
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
subject with k and then you can follow
 

605
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,230
subject with k and then you can follow
the link at least with

606
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
the link at least with
 

607
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,749
the link at least with
k times right now k times that uh

608
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
k times right now k times that uh
 

609
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,150
k times right now k times that uh
dense minus k times all right yeah okay

610
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
dense minus k times all right yeah okay
 

611
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,030
dense minus k times all right yeah okay
so

612
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
so
 

613
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,790
so
that's your approach yeah it's also very

614
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
that's your approach yeah it's also very
 

615
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,150
that's your approach yeah it's also very
good yeah

616
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
good yeah
 

617
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,990
good yeah
yes cat yeah always

618
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
yes cat yeah always
 

619
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,790
yes cat yeah always
yeah this is the code we are using today

620
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
yeah this is the code we are using today
 

621
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,749
yeah this is the code we are using today
with another

622
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
with another
 

623
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,629
with another
another then let's do it uh let's

624
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639
another then let's do it uh let's
 

625
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,470
another then let's do it uh let's
release the

626
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
release the
 

627
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,829
release the
uh case this is most important uh code

628
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
uh case this is most important uh code
 

629
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,629
uh case this is most important uh code
to take away

630
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
to take away
 

631
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,550
to take away
is 23 line 23 to 30

632
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
is 23 line 23 to 30
 

633
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,590
is 23 line 23 to 30
okay so get ahead we

634
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
okay so get ahead we
 

635
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,670
okay so get ahead we
first of all we launch a pointer which

636
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
first of all we launch a pointer which
 

637
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,509
first of all we launch a pointer which
works first

638
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
works first
 

639
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,310
works first
uh after the first pointer was k step

640
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
uh after the first pointer was k step
 

641
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,470
uh after the first pointer was k step
and we launched the second pointer

642
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
and we launched the second pointer
 

643
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,710
and we launched the second pointer
yeah so the second pointer the distance

644
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
yeah so the second pointer the distance
 

645
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,150
yeah so the second pointer the distance
between the second point and the first

646
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
between the second point and the first
 

647
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,670
between the second point and the first
pointer is what

648
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
pointer is what
 

649
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,189
pointer is what
what's the distance between the first

650
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
what's the distance between the first
 

651
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,110
what's the distance between the first
pointer and the second pointer

652
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
pointer and the second pointer
 

653
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,230
pointer and the second pointer
uh two okay okay

654
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
uh two okay okay
 

655
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,710
uh two okay okay
yeah and then one they also work at the

656
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
yeah and then one they also work at the
 

657
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,350
yeah and then one they also work at the
same speed

658
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
same speed
 

659
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,110
same speed
so when the first pointer reaches the

660
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
so when the first pointer reaches the
 

661
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,470
so when the first pointer reaches the
end where's the second pointer

662
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
end where's the second pointer
 

663
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,110
end where's the second pointer
uh k is the k to the last yeah from the

664
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
uh k is the k to the last yeah from the
 

665
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,069
uh k is the k to the last yeah from the
left okay

666
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
left okay
 

667
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,470
