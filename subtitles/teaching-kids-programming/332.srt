1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,639
hello mr mr wright how are you

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,320
okay so we talked about a graph and the

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,559
graph is the collection of vertex and

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,559
edges right the vertices and edges

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,800
yeah yeah

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,960
so

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,000
so for example like this

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,400
a

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,480
vertex to b

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,599
c

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,000
and then let's say i have a d here okay

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,320
let's say and then look if

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,800
this is the connected un-directional

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,360
graph connected means that there is no

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,879
you can travel from any vertex to any

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,360
other vertex right

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,760
this is not connected right if i have an

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,600
e here this is not connected

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,480
so we're talking about a

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,640
connected graph and

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,559
un-directional okay sorry un-directional

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,440
it doesn't have the direction so and i

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,719
can put a weight on it so let's say 1

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,960
two

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,760
okay let's put it cycle here like three

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,760
four five

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,920
so i have a weight

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,240
associated for each edges

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,240
yeah edges

30
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,049
[Music]

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,119
these are the weights okay

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,840
so this one has a cycle right because

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,080
look abc you can cycle and

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,320
bcd is also exactly

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,759
so look a tree we know it's a subset

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,280
right a tree the tree is a subset

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,280
right three doesn't have a cycle

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,720
remember with two for two it doesn't

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,720
know cycle yeah

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,360
and then three we want to make a tree

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,600
out of these graph

42
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,079
and it has to be connected right if it's

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,920
not connected if you if you don't have a

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,479
if if

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,520
you you pick these you know if you pick

46
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,000
these

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,920
right that's weight one that's way three

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,920
this is not connected but this is a

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,440
for it so we foreign to

50
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,920
pick the single tree one tree so

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,400
one tree another three trees with the

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,560
forest yeah

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,720
and also we want to

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,280
pick the edges that the sum of the

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,120
weight in the numbers on it are then

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,720
minimized are the smallest there are

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,160
five edges

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,800
mean

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,000
mean weight okay mean total weight

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,879
okay so these are the requirements

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,200
and we call this three what minimum

62
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,760
spending tree mst

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,879
minimum spending tree okay spending

64
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
spending

65
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,920
make sense

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,280
so how would you how do you pick how

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,360
would you draw a tree out of picking the

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,440
vertex and edges

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,959
how how would you do it

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,640
how would you do it

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,480
okay so first of all you have to pick

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,280
all uh vertex here

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,959
pick it always see but these isn't in a

74
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,879
circle yeah

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,200
okay okay so how which which energy

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,959
would you pick 24.

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,840
wow one

78
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,319
two

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,480
four yeah this is the smallest

80
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,480
okay i hope look for if there are n

81
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,480
vertices

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,200
oh yeah yeah one two three okay one two

83
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,400
three actually yeah this is better yeah

84
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,159
yeah yeah

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,630
so if there are other things how many

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,780
edges would you pick

87
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,780
[Music]

88
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,560
why is that

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,040
if i pick an a minus one i'll make it

90
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,360
connected and no cycle if i put one more

91
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,360
edges what happened

92
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,080
that would be all right so

93
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,519
so we want we don't want the cycle right

94
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,480
so for n

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,480
vertex graph

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,920
so that will be n minus one edges right

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,120
am i right look

98
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,360
one one vertex no edges yellow two

99
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,239
vertices you can only put one make it

100
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,360
connected one edges three

101
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,519
two right

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,599
yeah yeah you can pick these all these

103
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,759
or all these

104
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,079
but if you add one more

105
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,199
there will be a cycle differently right

106
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,639
so everybody takes n minus one edges to

107
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,800
make it no cycle a tree no cycle tree

108
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,120
and then you'll be making all the vertex

109
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,440
connected right and then we wanted the

110
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,759
spelling the the total minimum weight

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,639
the minimum weight

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,440
so

113
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,420
how did you find out is these the

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,899
one two three

115
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,899
[Music]

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,880
okay how about if i change this to ten

117
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,040
people one two four all right

118
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,960
yeah easier

119
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360
okay so the weight okay we want to find

120
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,560
the weight minimum weight of three sub

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,400
tree t is a subset of graph okay

122
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,919
and then these would be the weight of u

123
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,440
to v

124
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:19,440
the vertex yeah u and v

125
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,360
u to v belongs to the edges okay so we

126
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,160
want to minimize this right we don't

127
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,320
minimize this one way of doing this okay

128
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,360
let's bring it bring the topic today

129
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,360
which is called couscou

130
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,560
item okay so it's quite similar to

131
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,880
how how did you peel it how how did you

132
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,440
feel it

133
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
addition

134
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,960
nothing okay so this this one

135
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,280
yeah what abcd

136
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,440
so first of all the first step is to

137
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,360
what to create uh

138
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,319
to to create the

139
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,520
you know the the we call forest for each

140
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,600
forest and each one has no edge uh has

141
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,960
no edge so there will be four trees in

142
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,840
the flower is that

143
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,840
so

144
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,199
f f then let's say f at the beginning f

145
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,600
belongs to an empty set empty set

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,319
and then i i need to

147
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,319
to add a

148
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,400
at

149
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,280
each

150
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,680
tree individual tree the vertex single

151
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,680
vertex right so i will have add

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,080
add

153
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,440
each

154
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,720
each v

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,160
belongs to

156
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,280
v

157
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,360
to f okay this is the c dot

158
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,360
this is zero okay now look

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,400
so i would pick a smallest weight first

160
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,000
of all i would saw and then i was i

161
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:56,720
would salt salt the edges saw edges okay

162
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,360
so edges e belongs to e edges okay

163
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:04,479
i will show the edges so how many edges

164
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,800
will be one a to b which is one okay

165
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,960
which is one

166
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,360
and then what what's what's the smallest

167
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,160
b to c yeah b to c

168
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,479
two i i sorted the edges

169
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
and b to d

170
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,120
for

171
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,720
a to c

172
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,199
five

173
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,520
and what's next c to d

174
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,520
ten okay so these are the edges

175
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,880
sorting by the way smallest to the

176
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,360
biggest

177
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,280
make sense if there are e edges how

178
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,680
what's the time complexity to sort it by

179
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,120
the way salting

180
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199
sultan

181
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,639
and then e logan

182
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,639
there's no n common there are e edges

183
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,240
you have to say which n is what n is e

184
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
okay

185
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,160
or maybe o eric

186
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,160
love log l okay oh area

187
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,039
okay so now look we started we haven't

188
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,879
resorted and now

189
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,560
why

190
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:23,280
why the graph f is not connected why o

191
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,440
f is is not connected yeah connected

192
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,240
connected

193
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,240
now what what we do we remove first of

194
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,880
all we do move the smallest edge in this

195
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,839
case which is one right right

196
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,399
one

197
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,440
if it doesn't form the cycle in this f

198
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,399
okay this is f if this is not in the

199
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,519
cycle

200
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,640
then we we connect it so one yeah

201
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,640
for the one right

202
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,120
so the next one is b

203
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,800
uh bc2 right we have picked this edge

204
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,000
already and i will pick this

205
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,120
bc2 we put it here

206
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,600
okay and then the next one pd4 easy okay

207
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,040
so next one is a bit tricky

208
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
i need to pick one more edges

209
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,640
ac5

210
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,920
right

211
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,839
look for this ac5 uh

212
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,920
look i pick one

213
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,920
i pick these

214
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,440
i pick this cd

215
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,399
okay so now if i pick ac that we'll have

216
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,480
a cycle we have a cycle here right

217
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,959
and that will be because we say we don't

218
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,200
want the cycle so we can't pick this so

219
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,959
we skip this we skip this

220
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,440
we skip it so what's the next one

221
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,680
oh actually we uh

222
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,160
actually we already uh finished yeah

223
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,760
because there are four four vertices we

224
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,680
only pick three right

225
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,959
okay so maybe this is not a good example

226
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,959
maybe let's do another one okay

227
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,920
okay let's use this example okay

228
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,800
one two four two

229
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,800
and wow

230
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,839
okay maybe you're right let's try okay

231
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,360
let's try

232
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,720
oh

233
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,959
um

234
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,880
i need to change the

235
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,279
value to a little bit maybe this i will

236
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,279
put a

237
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,880
four here okay and then this will be

238
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,760
three oh man okay

239
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,000
so

240
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,040
so let's say this is a

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,160
b

242
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,920
c the biggest one that you get is seven

243
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,240
three ten five two four three four

244
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,160
two four okay okay so how about

245
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,279
now let's let's try this aggregate to

246
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,279
see if

247
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,760
two four three four so what let's start

248
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,120
with the edges solid edges what's the

249
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,480
13

250
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,920
sp to c

251
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,360
b to c

252
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,279
is two and then what's next b3 yeah b to

253
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,320
e e3

254
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,399
what's next for b to d is right

255
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,839
or a to b is also four right it doesn't

256
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,240
matter

257
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,240
which one comes first

258
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
and then what

259
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,480
then what's next a to c five right we

260
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,120
sorted the edges

261
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,200
and what's next seven right b to e

262
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,360
all right and what's next

263
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,320
c to d

264
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,640
okay

265
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,120
so first of all we we start with these

266
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,440
individual trees as far as we pick the

267
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,640
smallest edge which is b to c two right

268
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,560
b to c

269
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,079
two

270
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,200
okay b to c

271
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,360
so i pick the b for c here

272
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,959
i know what's next b to e

273
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,800
i pick d to e which is what three

274
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,720
yeah

275
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,320
i know what's next p to t right it

276
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,560
doesn't still have uh it doesn't fall on

277
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,639
the cycle yet four

278
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,440
yeah so this edge this edge

279
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,240
okay next one a to b for

280
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,240
and b4

281
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,360
and oh it still doesn't form cycle so

282
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,399
okay so maybe i need to find a better

283
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,480
algorithm i'll find a better example

284
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,560
right because you already find because

285
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,880
we already find it right

286
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,880
huh

287
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,800
okay maybe maybe i will change this to

288
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
40.

289
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,600
oh

290
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,600
so you don't pick these

291
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:39,600
[Music]

292
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,600
okay so a to b 40 will be here a to b

293
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,360
and you have to drop this

294
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,399
okay so again look at ascent bc i pick a

295
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,320
b c

296
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,880
b e

297
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,360
and b d okay so the next one

298
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,920
next one i will pick a to c right you

299
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,480
see it still works right so

300
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,839
so the idea is that we don't pick an n

301
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,959
if it's a

302
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,560
if this edge is already forming a cycle

303
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,639
we skip it okay i need to find an

304
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,560
example which which does that okay maybe

305
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:14,560
i i i do this one more okay so

306
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,480
so you see a better example okay

307
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,480
a

308
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,480
be

309
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,720
c

310
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,959
b

311
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,320
i pick a big better example it doesn't

312
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,320
have a cycle

313
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,279
s

314
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,240
so i picked a one

315
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,600
two

316
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,959
i got two

317
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,920
three

318
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,680
four

319
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,959
five six seven okay so for this one

320
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,519
for this one

321
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,600
one two one i picked one here all right

322
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,639
one and the next one the smallest will

323
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,440
be two

324
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,920
four

325
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,480
but now look the next one is three but

326
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,440
it has a cycle so i skipped

327
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,480
one two four six four

328
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,920
six

329
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,519
and then five five no no i have a cider

330
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,959
six six

331
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
six

332
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,600
and i'll be here because how many

333
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,079
vertices one two three four five five

334
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,680
vertex i need to pick four edges one two

335
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,880
three four got

336
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,440
yeah

337
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,000
okay look okay so look this one is

338
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,160
easier i just said a to b

339
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,639
a to b one

340
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,279
a to b one

341
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,120
b to c is two

342
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,320
and

343
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,199
a to c is 3

344
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,720
c 3

345
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,600
is 4

346
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,480
1

347
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,240
b to d is 5

348
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,360
and then c to e c to f is six

349
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:52,480
a to f is seven

350
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,480
okay so look we pick these we pick this

351
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,040
we pick this

352
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,480
but we don't pick this this is a cycle

353
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,240
right we don't pick this

354
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,760
four we pick this

355
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,160
five we don't pick this because we have

356
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,760
a cycle c f six

357
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,399
c f uh six we pick this and then

358
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,880
another way because we already pick uh

359
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,680
that's one two three four five six we

360
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,680
don't need to pick six edges

361
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,160
uh no no no no

362
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,320
uh one two three four we

363
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,000
need to pick four edges

364
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,720
one two three four okay

365
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
yeah make sense yeah

366
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,440
so

367
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,440
tick tick cross stick

368
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,199
so what every time we pick

369
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,560
uh pick the edges we merge two

370
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,360
components into one right right yeah

371
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,240
so how how this is kind of greedy right

372
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,320
so

373
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,959
why is this

374
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,480
why how how can we prove this by this

375
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,000
approach is uh

376
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,000
it's the minimum spending chain

377
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,160
how do you prove it how how does this

378
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,639
work basically just trying to get the

379
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,199
smallest number yeah smallest number

380
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,279
with no cycle there's no sign yeah look

381
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,240
every time we merge we have a merge two

382
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,440
thing we pick the smallest a uh edge for

383
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,800
example this is e we pick it look if we

384
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,560
don't pick it

385
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,399
if we don't pick it there will be some

386
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,880
other

387
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:23,320
some other edge which will have the side

388
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,320
to this one right right

389
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,199
so look this is the edge we are trying

390
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,959
to pick if we don't pick this smallest

391
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,480
edge there will be some other edge going

392
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,040
to pick

393
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,360
to connect these two components right

394
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,120
and if that edge is not it's going to

395
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,800
pick they will have a cycle and if it

396
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,759
has a cycle why not we just pick this

397
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,639
edge all right don't get it so this is

398
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,959
this proves that this is a smaller

399
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,440
minimum spanning tree okay

400
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,240
okay and we can use the what kind of

401
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,240
data structure can we use to to find if

402
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,160
two two vertex

403
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,279
belongs to the same parent

404
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,079
same group

405
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,079
remember we have used we have learned a

406
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,880
data structure remember

407
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,679
destroying that well done yeah look we

408
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,679
have a look at we have a group a b c d a

409
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,559
b c d and we for the disjoint set we can

410
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,360
check

411
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,160
we can merge these to any two or we can

412
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,919
check if two parent uh if two components

413
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,199
belongs to the same group yeah we can

414
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,880
check how many uh components connected

415
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,120
how many uh number of connected

416
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,679
components right so this is done by this

417
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,679
joint set this june set okay john said

418
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,559
okay

419
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,720
so

420
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,960
when we uh so what's the time complexity

421
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,520
for this cousco

422
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,520
remember

423
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,280
what's the what's the approach

424
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,840
yeah saltine yeah first of all we're

425
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,840
sorting and then we need to find uh we

426
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,360
we need to find the smallest edge from

427
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,039
the

428
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,480
formula we need to go through the

429
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,559
smallest uh

430
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,280
edges from the smallest to the biggest

431
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,280
right and then fine if these so there's

432
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,520
another operation

433
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,240
we need to find out the

434
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,000
if two components if two vertex belongs

435
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,160
to the same edge and we can use this

436
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,880
using the disjoint set okay the time

437
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,200
complexity for left beat to check if two

438
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,600
vertex belongs to the same right uh in a

439
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,400
disturbance set is trivial compared to

440
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,280
the

441
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
uh

442
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,480
you know

443
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,559
compare comparing to going through the

444
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,840
edges okay so the time complexity will

445
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,120
be this one for the cool stuff okay

446
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,400
make sense

447
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,000
okay i'm going to give you another

448
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,320
example and then you tell me what's the

449
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,080
spending tree and i'll be for today okay

450
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,080
you both okay you both do it right

451
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,869
[Music]

452
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,280
okay so these are three

453
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,240
one

454
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,000
two

455
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,360
three four

456
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,200
five six seven okay

457
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,679
are you ready come on

458
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,760
you want to try

459
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,320
no please you want to try

460
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,720
okay so listen

461
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,960
no no no you're telling me

462
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,360
what hey okay you tell me how hard you

463
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,360
write it

464
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,559
hey

465
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,760
a yeah a okay and then what's next

466
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,840
and then

467
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,400
to b

468
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,160
to b okay this one two

469
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,000
and then what's this three

470
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,280
sorry like that yeah

471
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
okay okay i know what's next i'm then

472
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,200
don't pick four nine don't take five

473
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,480
nine can we pick six yeah yeah

474
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
oh what's next

475
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,520
do we need to pick again nine

476
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,640
how many how many what is one two three

477
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,320
four five

478
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,200
so we need to pick four edges how many

479
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:01,440
edges are we got we have to get yeah

480
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,440
that's it okay we have one no no no

481
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,880
so look one two three four okay okay

482
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,840
yeah makes sense okay that's it for

483
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
today

484
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,120
bye bye

485
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,120
bye bye
