1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,880
okay okay can you be a little bit

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,679
quieter please

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,000
okay so today we're going to show you uh

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,880
how to draw a chess ball a chessboard is

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,720
8x8 yeah and then the black squares and

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,039
then the y squares they are interleaving

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,000
with each other okay so

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,080
so how can we draw a square do you still

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,320
recall how do we draw a square with the

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,840
size n for example how do we how do we

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,840
ask the turtle to draw

12
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,079
four and then yeah repeat four times

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,719
every time we go

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,360
90 degrees

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,800
okay first of all let's define the

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,039
define the

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,680
square function yeah squares with size n

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,200
so what do we do we repeat four times

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,559
will be the first time

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,879
so each time we for what for what is the

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,480
function from the third package for what

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,760
size n

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,359
and then

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,520
we and

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,400
right is turn right turn right 90 degree

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,840
okay so let's see square

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,880
100

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,799
yeah easy yeah easy easy funny

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,080
okay so how do we draw a fierce square

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,759
end field and begin fear and inferior

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,200
that's one way okay

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,159
easier

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,479
okay so for example i say square

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,360
sphere yeah square field

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,159
n

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,840
so first of all we begin here

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,600
and then we draw a square we call this

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,439
function and then we end up here yeah

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,520
end of here

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,799
okay first of all let's reset okay and

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,799
then to draw a square here

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,799
100

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,680
first of all you draw a square and then

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,840
you try it was trying to fill in it yeah

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,320
that's one way the other way would be to

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,200
draw to to draw to ask the turtle to

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,759
draw from size one draw a size one

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,680
square and then draw a size one size two

49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,280
squares or size three square you'll be

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,119
much slower okay

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,240
for example let's let's redefine this

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,600
function

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,399
and

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,039
and then for the size yeah

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,319
current size i in red start from one up

56
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,120
to n right

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,640
and then each time i draw a square with

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,000
size i

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,840
i love it also okay okay let's reset

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,080
and

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,120
then square fear

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,920
let's just draw 15 yeah you see

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,000
is it you're trying to

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,120
first of all you create the size

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,440
yeah it's you try to draw a size

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,480
one square size two square size three

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,560
until you see the animation so the the

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,680
third is actually quite busy so it's

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,200
kind of slow okay it's kind of fun

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,959
okay so

71
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,720
how do we draw

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,080
how do we draw a

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,920
chess ball

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,680
i mean first of all it's

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,159
it's white uh

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,239
okay so it's black square and then

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,680
white square and then black square and

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,480
white square

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,159
black square like we just did and then

80
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,360
do a white

81
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,280
square

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
actually you don't have to feel it so

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,599
look the thing is that look here i'm

84
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,480
here yeah i draw a black square and i

85
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,000
need to

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,560
go

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,720
i feel it but now i need to move the

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,239
turtle

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,319
yeah so i go an unit and and it says and

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,720
i draw a white

91
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,440
and then i go go for and you don't have

92
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,480
to

93
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,400
yeah so i actually look this a pair a

94
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,400
pair of black and white so i need to

95
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,200
repeat these four times right so that

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,519
will be one side and then

97
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,440
when i reach the end i need to turn

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,920
turn the other side and the turtle needs

99
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,560
is now facing right i need to ask it to

100
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,000
face right left and then you can start

101
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,080
drawing

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,239
all right you can start drawing another

103
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,760
pair of the another four pairs of black

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,439
and white square

105
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,799
am right yeah

106
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,280
so look

107
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,200
look if i draw the black here white

108
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,840
black white black white black white the

109
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,879
rhinos the square will be white right

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,480
and then the other row the next row on

111
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,720
the right hand side will be

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,560
black right yeah because it's

113
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,320
interleaving so you don't want to have

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,400
two continuously

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,280
consecutive the black squares or y

116
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,759
squares right so uh

117
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,400
okay so first of all let's just we

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,720
implement this uh with the

119
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,440
uh it doesn't matter okay let's just

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,840
uh implement this a little bit okay

121
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,000
okay so this is the one so let's do this

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,199
okay so define chest chest and

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,320
this end

124
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,560
and it's the size of the chest yeah well

125
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,479
we want to repeat four times yeah

126
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,639
because four times two rows four times

127
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,000
two equals eight right

128
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,320
in range four and then for each each row

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,960
each row i will have first of all i will

130
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,840
repeat four pairs yeah

131
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,759
and then first of all i will draw a

132
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,520
square which is

133
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,240
n

134
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,639
and then i will go forward

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,960
yeah and then i can draw an appear which

136
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,800
is square field yeah n

137
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,199
yeah and then i need to go and grow

138
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,280
another n unit

139
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,000
now i'm at the end at the end and i need

140
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,560
to turn right turn right yeah

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,720
turn right and then i need to forward

142
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,840
the two two times of n why is that

143
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,560
because because it was only here right

144
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,919
here and he needs to go here

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,000
go here

146
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,600
and facing left

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,080
so turn left

148
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,680
then i need to turn right

149
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,600
turn right of the 90 degree

150
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,919
okay and then now i'm starting to

151
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,680
drawing from right to left

152
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,000
starting to draw from the right left so

153
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,840
another four pairs of the black and

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,479
white

155
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,479
okay

156
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,120
yeah a square first of all is a square

157
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,600
and then go another end

158
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,919
jumps to the next position to draw a

159
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,639
field square

160
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,720
square field

161
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,600
and then i go to another

162
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,160
end unit and then prepare for

163
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,880
at the end i need to

164
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,120
turn

165
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,360
turn right nine eight uh

166
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,319
turn the opposite i tend to the opposite

167
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,080
turn right dot 10 left 90 degree okay

168
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,360
180 degrees

169
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,319
okay let's do this 15.

170
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,360
first of all i need to reset it

171
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,199
let's make a color blue okay

172
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,800
actually it's black yeah oh you already

173
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,600
this black we don't need to change the

174
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
color speed minus one make it a bit

175
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,319
faster

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,240
chest

177
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,479
fifteen

178
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,599
okay so you see it's actually animating

179
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,759
look it it yeah it draws four pairs of

180
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,360
black and white squares and it goes to

181
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,199
the end and it turns around

182
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,039
contouring from the right to the left

183
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,400
yeah okay

184
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,360
drawing from the right to the left

185
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,560
actually

186
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,560
is this one square on a white squirrel

187
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,120
do you start on the black square uh it

188
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,120
doesn't matter

189
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,840
ah okay okay yeah yeah it's i i actually

190
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,000
don't know but actually we can just swap

191
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
these two yeah at least we can

192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,160
every time we can

193
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,759
uh here we always start with the white

194
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,840
square you see

195
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,960
yeah so we start with the y square and

196
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,840
then here

197
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,280
uh this line is actually drawing is here

198
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,120
right yeah you see all right so if we

199
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,120
swap the square and a square here that

200
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,520
you'll be the opposite

201
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,120
okay you actually notice that it's quite

202
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,520
slow here because it's the feeding

203
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,360
procedure is a bit slowly we can we can

204
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,360
replace it with the

205
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,240
uh after this we can replace it with the

206
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,560
let

207
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,560
we with the begin field okay now it

208
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,520
should be all right reset

209
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,879
let's reset it okay speed minus one okay

210
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,280
and then let's

211
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,199
uh

212
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,120
let's revert to the previous version

213
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,199
which is this one yeah

214
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,599
begin here and then let's do the chest

215
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,879
again 15.

216
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,599
is it it's much much faster right

217
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,639
yeah make sense

218
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,560
do even faster no i can't but this is

219
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,879
the thing yeah i can

220
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,240
i can i can i can do

221
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,639
i can

222
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,599
make a like uh

223
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,720
30 make it twice big

224
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,960
but it's

225
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,560
but it's actually oh i i didn't change

226
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,880
the speed okay i probably should change

227
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,399
the speed let's

228
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,479
let's reset

229
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:43,360
speed minus one even bigger okay

230
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,560
uh 50 maybe you will be going

231
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,560
over the boundary

232
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,040
oh no okay

233
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,040
yeah

234
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,959
uh

235
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,120
it's open screen it's off the screen

236
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
which one is off screen yeah yeah yeah

237
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,880
but and this command window is also off

238
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,720
the screen let's just pull it a little

239
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,519
bit so you see the command here okay

240
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,279
yeah

241
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,440
so okay to sum up how do we draw a list

242
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,640
we first start with the y square and

243
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,560
then draw four pairs

244
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,000
and then we're here we need to turn

245
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,160
right turn

246
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,200
turn the opposite way and then start to

247
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,680
draw the white square black square again

248
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,240
here and then when we're here

249
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,959
one on the second row

250
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,800
then we need to do what we need to

251
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,959
turn the opposite yeah so basically

252
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,600
basically the the the turtle will be

253
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,440
going this way this way here this way

254
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,480
yeah you see the circle going that's how

255
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,480
it draws okay make sense yeah

256
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,120
okay okay that will be it for today bye

257
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,920
bye bye bye bye

258
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,920
bye
