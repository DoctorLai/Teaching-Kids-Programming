1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
hello hello mr mr right right okay so

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,680
give a list

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,919
okay

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,519
ah you click

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,440
okay

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,599
three to the power of zero plus three

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,200
times two equals ten or obviously you

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,200
can you can nine

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,040
number to the power available zero

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,440
equals one a is not equal to zero okay

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,520
so mathematics speaking

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,399
zero to the power of zero is not defined

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,440
and another way is to use the square

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,840
root

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,920
square root

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,280
flooring growing yeah okay so the other

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,280
way is the aquarium

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,170
okay the leaves is flowing

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,520
this is silly

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,760
[Music]

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,480
the arrangement we talked about that

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,840
in

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,840
roughly 100 days depending

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
for example you're given three letters

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,799
and you want to put it in

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,119
the mailbox numbers from one to three so

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,400
there are three more

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,840
so you made a box you caught one

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,159
and then you have three letters yeah

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,280
three letters

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,360
it could be anything one two three

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
so

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,439
the arrangement is that the weight the

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,759
number of ways you can put these in the

35
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,079
mailbox but not in the box of yourself

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,479
okay so one cannot put it into one two

37
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,799
cannot put it into two so you can not

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,799
put it into three so we have three one

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,200
two that's good next

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,079
and also two

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,320
three one all right there's only two way

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,079
you know this symbol is factorial right

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,479
n times n minus one times n minus two

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,119
times q one and if you put this

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,600
exclamation mark in the front

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,159
this is derangement so

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,880
exclamation mark three equals two and

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,680
how about exclamation mark two equal

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,159
to

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,159
equal one

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,760
we have n letters and n boxes and how

52
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,720
many ways if we use this f n meaning the

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,840
number of ways to put these n items into

54
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,879
n boxes the one cannot be put into

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,920
number of excel if i'm considering here

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,040
the number here the this n i n item the

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,840
number s

58
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,440
i can put it into n minus one ways right

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,080
i cannot put it here right obviously

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,920
yeah but i have n minus one choice

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,560
and minus one choice

62
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,920
so if i put it here k for example then

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,040
one way is i can swap this k with n

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,599
right

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,840
if i sort it and the rest will be the

66
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,800
remaining will be n minus two right i'm

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,200
right because this item one is item two

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,760
so n minus two

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,159
and that will be f n minus two

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,239
right if i'm not working with the end

71
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:09,519
item then i have n minus one

72
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,360
f n minus one all right yeah so i plus s

73
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,200
and minus one

74
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,080
okay so this is the derangement

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,120
recursion formula f of n equals n minus

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,959
one times fn minus 2 plus f minus 1.

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,360
okay we just talked about this

78
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,959
we can implement this using recursion

79
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,640
and putting the cache right like a

80
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,400
typography number there will be a

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,159
dynamic programming top-down dynamic

82
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,879
problem okay so coming back to this

83
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,519
question so three three three we hope

84
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,959
can we make a ten so it's uh

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,599
this is two

86
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,280
plus three that's five

87
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,440
times

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,159
two equals ten

89
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,959
these are the four ways okay define f

90
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,799
and

91
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,400
and for the cash to remember the

92
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,920
intermediate value if n equal equal one

93
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,879
or zero right if equals zero equals one

94
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,840
return the value will be zero f s zero f

95
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,879
one

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,120
you know if n is to return

97
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,040
one right there's only one way and then

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
we can return

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,959
f

100
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,200
n minus one plus f and minus two this is

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,560
fibonacci number but we need times m n

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,799
minus one

103
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,479
okay this is the recursion with

104
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,880
minimization top-down dynamic

105
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,199
programming okay we put the cache

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,360
so the time complexity will be o n

107
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,000
because the the maximum number of states

108
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,560
we're remembering we're calculating is n

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,639
we can also use the bottom up dynamic

110
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,639
programming okay so we use the

111
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,160
array to store the values so we

112
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:42,400
calculate that f0 and then f1

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,040
f2 and we can calculate f3 f4 and here

114
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,000
fn this is like fibonacci number so

115
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,120
defined f and

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,680
obviously this is this sphere applies

117
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:59,199
so we use the pp ep for zero times m

118
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,680
plus 1 dp 2 equals

119
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,479
db2 equals 1 for

120
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,880
i

121
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,919
in range 3 until n

122
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,600
then

123
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,560
b p i

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,400
equals i minus 1

125
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,680
times d p

126
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:22,240
i minus 1 plus d p

127
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,039
i minus 2 returns d p

128
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,840
n or d p minus one so quite similar to

129
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,960
fibonacci number right this is the

130
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,960
difference

131
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,360
yeah this is the difference have you

132
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,080
noticed that dpi we want to calculate

133
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,680
dpi only based on dpi minus one and

134
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,080
minus two so you can use the two

135
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,479
variables to iteratively instead of use

136
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,960
the dp array right because this one the

137
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,600
space complexity with o n we are using

138
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,520
array to store the values so we can use

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,240
two variables so a

140
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,680
b equals zero one okay so we don't need

141
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
this

142
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,680
and then

143
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,400
a b equals b and then a

144
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,520
plus b times

145
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,120
i minus one okay and then we turn b

146
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,479
this implementation is the most

147
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,560
efficient right because they will use

148
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,120
the iterative and then we use two

149
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,000
variables to keep tracking the values

150
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,000
what have we learned today

151
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,639
[Music]

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,639
so if

153
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,639
it but you can't put

154
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,080
your letter or email or whatever you're

155
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,800
doing

156
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,120
into your own one

157
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,560
arrangement three equals two the range

158
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,560
of two good ones

159
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,319
right okay so okay

160
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,000
yeah so basically the arrangement we

161
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,800
talk about these arrangements there are

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,520
n items and we want to find out the

163
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,160
number of ways to put these and items

164
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,120
into lists and boxes and places but each

165
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,880
item cannot be put into the number of

166
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,039
each song and we want to find out the

167
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,880
number of ways of doing that so that's

168
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,400
quite useful in real life for example

169
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,240
like you and your friends right

170
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,919
preparing the gift birthday gift you

171
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
want to exchange birthday gift how many

172
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,840
ways can you do it right you can't

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,039
obviously you cannot give yourself your

174
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,000
own present

175
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,680
all right

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,520
yeah so that's the arrangement for

177
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,560
example like how many students you know

178
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,440
class

179
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,759
about 30 30 okay so that derangement

180
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,440
certainly so for example like all of you

181
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,240
prefer prepare the gift estimation of 30

182
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,319
right

183
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,919
this is a very big number so we can use

184
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,919
this formula

185
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:49,360
f n equals m minus one times

186
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,599
f n minus one plus f minus two

187
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,599
okay so this part is fibonacci we just

188
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,160
need to times it with n minus one and

189
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,879
the way to understand these we have to

190
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,199
talk about that as well this is that we

191
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,840
considering that looking at the end item

192
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,000
and then how many ways can we put these

193
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,360
and items there are n minus one ways

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,280
right obviously you can put it in the

195
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,599
last item you can put it in the first

196
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,000
and minus one items and suppose the one

197
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,000
we can put into the number called k

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,400
and then there's two situations one way

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,680
is that you can exchange you can swap

200
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,319
k and n

201
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,879
and then that leaves us the f and minus

202
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,080
two right because they're n items and

203
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,560
then k and n there are two items the

204
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,240
remaining will be f minus two

205
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,800
if not if we are not putting the k

206
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,360
at the end so there are f and minus one

207
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,800
i ways to do that right so that comes

208
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,800
with this

209
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,800
okay that's it for today bye

210
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
bye
