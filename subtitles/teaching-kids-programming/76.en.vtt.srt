00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
research tree
 

19
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,670
research tree
it's a tree like it has numbers

20
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
it's a tree like it has numbers
 

21
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,910
it's a tree like it has numbers
yeah can you can you call it can you

yeah can you can you call it can you
 

23
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,389
yeah can you can you call it can you
draw a final research tree

24
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399

 

25
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,270

any spine is that's true okay you can

26
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
any spine is that's true okay you can
 

27
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,910
any spine is that's true okay you can
have try

28

33
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,470

i'm yes remember what's binary search

34
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
i'm yes remember what's binary search
 

35
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,470
i'm yes remember what's binary search
tree now you just

36
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,480
tree now you just
 

37
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,189
tree now you just
what that's not about research tree like

38
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
what that's not about research tree like
 

39
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:55,910
what that's not about research tree like

it
 

59
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,469
it
because this is the final tree but it's

60
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
because this is the final tree but it's
 

61
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,390
because this is the final tree but it's
not yet a binary search tree

62
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
not yet a binary search tree
 

63
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,270
not yet a binary search tree
you need to put numbers in it uh we do

64
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
you need to put numbers in it uh we do
 

65
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,149
you need to put numbers in it uh we do
that

66
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
that
 

67
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,070
that
no no this is not a pine research tree

68
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
no no this is not a pine research tree
 

69
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,270
no no this is not a pine research tree
because look it

70
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
because look it
 

71
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,350
because look it
has a circuit besides a cycle can you

72
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
has a circuit besides a cycle can you
 

73
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,630
has a circuit besides a cycle can you
put anything on

74
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
put anything on
 

75
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,069
put anything on
anything anything i just put a random

76
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
anything anything i just put a random
 

77
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:39,190
anything anything i just put a random
random number yes i just put four

79
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,030

what no this is not a brand research

80
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
what no this is not a brand research

tree look this number
 

83
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,830
tree look this number
we disconnected and then the number

84
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
we disconnected and then the number
 

85
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,749
we disconnected and then the number
remember the numbers on the left should

86
00:01:47,749 --> 00:01:47,759
remember the numbers on the left should
 

87
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,069
remember the numbers on the left should
be

88
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
be
 

89
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,830
be
smaller the numbers on the right should

90
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
smaller the numbers on the right should
 

91
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,429
smaller the numbers on the right should
be bigger

92
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439

i want to keep a range like from one to

172
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
i want to keep a range like from one to
 

173
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,309
i want to keep a range like from one to
two

174
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
two
 

175
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,430
two
to three to three to five

176
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
to three to three to five
 

177
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,350
to three to three to five
okay three to five inclusive

178
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
okay three to five inclusive
 

179
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,390
okay three to five inclusive
so what does it mean is that you need to

180
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
so what does it mean is that you need to
 

181
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,789
so what does it mean is that you need to
return the tree trim color tree which is

182
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
return the tree trim color tree which is
 

183
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,949
return the tree trim color tree which is
not in this range

184
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
not in this range
 

185
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,589
not in this range
four is in this one i keep it two is not

186
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
four is in this one i keep it two is not
 

187
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,390
four is in this one i keep it two is not
in the range

188
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
in the range
 

189
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,750
in the range
i drop it six is not in the range i drop

190
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
i drop it six is not in the range i drop
 

191
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,390
i drop it six is not in the range i drop
it so

192
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
it so
 

193
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,630

two and two and seven okay every now
 

201
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,390
two and two and seven okay every now
inside two and seven is five four is it

202
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
inside two and seven is five four is it
 

203
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,030
inside two and seven is five four is it
to enter

204
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
to enter
 

205
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,589
to enter
two point seven this is inside only one

206
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
two point seven this is inside only one
 

207
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,390
two point seven this is inside only one
is not

208
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
is not
 

209
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,350
is not
so it's this one yeah can we get it so

so it's this one yeah can we get it so
 

211
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,869
so it's this one yeah can we get it so
how do we show

212
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
how do we show
 

213
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,070
how do we show
more than one sorry more like what

214
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
more than one sorry more like what
 

215
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,470
more than one sorry more like what
happened

216
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
happened
 

217
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,069
happened
if we need to do more than one cut

218
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
if we need to do more than one cut
 

219
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,110
if we need to do more than one cut
no what can you give me an example we'll

220
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
no what can you give me an example we'll
 

221
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,509
no what can you give me an example we'll
do

222

do
 

223
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,270
do
more than one cut you always have one

224
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
more than one cut you always have one
 

225
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,950
more than one cut you always have one
you don't

226
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:23,960
you don't
 

227
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:33,749
you don't
understand you only understand your

228
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759

 

229
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,230

no i mean this is the range like a range

230
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
no i mean this is the range like a range
 

231
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,430
no i mean this is the range like a range
lower

232
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
lower
 

233
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,430
lower
low and high so i want you to cut a note

234
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
low and high so i want you to cut a note
 

235
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,909
low and high so i want you to cut a note
that i want you to cut the nose cut the

236
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
that i want you to cut the nose cut the
 

237
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,870
that i want you to cut the nose cut the
binary tree

238
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
binary tree
 

239
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,990
binary tree
in such as that each node

240
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
in such as that each node
 

241
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,310
in such as that each node
is within this range if it's not within

242
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
is within this range if it's not within
 

243
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,990
is within this range if it's not within
range i'll cut it

244
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
range i'll cut it
 

245
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,110
range i'll cut it
yes yeah

246
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
yes yeah
 

247
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,030
yes yeah
okay so do you have any idea how do we

248
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
okay so do you have any idea how do we
 

249
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,670
okay so do you have any idea how do we
do this

250
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
do this
 

251
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,189
do this
any thoughts all you need to do

252
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
any thoughts all you need to do
 

253
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,230
any thoughts all you need to do
is take one away

254
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
is take one away
 

255
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,830
is take one away
we need to check current value

256
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
we need to check current value
 

257
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,190
we need to check current value
everything is red

258
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,200

 

259
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:22,830

[Music]

260
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840

 

261
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,150

um

262
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
um
 

263
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,990
um
if this note is smaller

264
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
if this note is smaller
 

265
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,189
if this note is smaller
smaller for example like if i wanted uh

266
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
smaller for example like if i wanted uh
 

267
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,629
smaller for example like if i wanted uh
i want to the range is 5 to

268
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
i want to the range is 5 to
 

269
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,670
i want to the range is 5 to
10 okay 4 is it smaller than

270
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
10 okay 4 is it smaller than
 

271
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,830
10 okay 4 is it smaller than
5 yeah yes so 4 is smaller than 5. so it

272
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
5 yeah yes so 4 is smaller than 5. so it
 

273
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,310
5 yeah yes so 4 is smaller than 5. so it
means that

274
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
means that
 

275
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,310
means that
this note that we don't need it yeah

276
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
this note that we don't need it yeah
 

277
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,590
this note that we don't need it yeah
these

278
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
these
 

279
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,510
these
we cut it yeah yeah

280
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520

 

281
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,790

because it's outside this range

282
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
because it's outside this range
 

283
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,749
because it's outside this range
yeah got it the same as if it's bigger

284
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
yeah got it the same as if it's bigger
 

285
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,390
yeah got it the same as if it's bigger
like if it's

286
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
like if it's
 

287
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,590
like if it's
11 and i need to cut it right yeah

288
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
11 and i need to cut it right yeah
 

289
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,029
11 and i need to cut it right yeah
so together this is once if it's four

290
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
so together this is once if it's four
 

291
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,590
so together this is once if it's four
let's do this one if it's 11 look if

292
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
let's do this one if it's 11 look if
 

293
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,070
let's do this one if it's 11 look if
this is 11 then two this way yeah

294
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
this is 11 then two this way yeah
 

295
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,350
this is 11 then two this way yeah
two this way yeah yeah yes

296
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
two this way yeah yeah yes
 

297
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,550
two this way yeah yeah yes
and how about if it's can't be eleven

298
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
and how about if it's can't be eleven
 

299
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,070
and how about if it's can't be eleven
because this would happen

300
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
because this would happen
 

301
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,430
because this would happen
yeah i know i know i'm just giving the

302
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
yeah i know i know i'm just giving the
 

303
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,350
yeah i know i know i'm just giving the
example good good good job

304
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
example good good good job
 

305
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,430
example good good good job
if it's if it's something between this

306
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
if it's if it's something between this
 

307
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,270
if it's if it's something between this
range we keep it yeah

308
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
range we keep it yeah
 

309
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,309
range we keep it yeah
then we do this recursively on the left

310
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
then we do this recursively on the left
 

311
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,390
then we do this recursively on the left
left tree and the right tree all right

312
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
left tree and the right tree all right
 

313
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,590
left tree and the right tree all right
yeah okay so let's

314
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
yeah okay so let's
 

315
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,150
yeah okay so let's
do this coding very quick very quick

316
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
do this coding very quick very quick
 

317
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,150
do this coding very quick very quick
coin

318
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
coin
 

319
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,749
coin
and now six minutes cut

320
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
and now six minutes cut
 

321
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,469
and now six minutes cut
cut three okay country copy as c3 okay

322
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479

 

323
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,589

if load is

324
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
if load is
 

325
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,950
if load is
num

326
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960

 

327
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,670

uh oh we need to get a range right we

328
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
uh oh we need to get a range right we
 

329
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,870
uh oh we need to get a range right we
need to give a range

330
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
need to give a range
 

331
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,749
need to give a range
lower high okay let's just do this l and

332
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:03,759
lower high okay let's just do this l and
 

333
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,070
lower high okay let's just do this l and
r

334
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
r
 

335
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,189
r

we need to cut the left tree
 

437
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,829
we need to cut the left tree
and then we need to cut the right tree

438
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
and then we need to cut the right tree
 

439
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,190
