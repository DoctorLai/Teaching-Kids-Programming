00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,789
hello hello mr mr ryan how are you today
today we'll talk about cartesian product

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:06,799
today we'll talk about cartesian product
 

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:07,829
today we'll talk about cartesian product
okay no

6
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
okay no
 

7
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,310
okay no
addition is quotation okay product is

8
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
addition is quotation okay product is
 

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,190
addition is quotation okay product is
another word of multiply right

10
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
another word of multiply right
 

11
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,150
another word of multiply right
multiplication

12
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
multiplication
 

13
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,109
multiplication
okay it is called test okay okay can we

14
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
okay it is called test okay okay can we
 

15
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,029
okay it is called test okay okay can we
focus on the thing here okay

16
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
focus on the thing here okay
 

17
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,230
focus on the thing here okay
so this is another word of

18
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
so this is another word of
 

19
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,230
so this is another word of
multiplication multiple multiply

multiplication multiple multiply
 

21
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,910
multiplication multiple multiply
so look if i have a 18. that y is a bit

22
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
so look if i have a 18. that y is a bit
 

23
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,350
so look if i have a 18. that y is a bit
yeah yeah yeah okay this is

24
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
yeah yeah yeah okay this is
 

25
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,549
yeah yeah yeah okay this is
a a list of a is a b

26
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559
a a list of a is a b
 

27
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,830
a a list of a is a b
and a list of b is let's say at least

28
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
and a list of b is let's say at least
 

29
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,010
and a list of b is let's say at least
okay

30
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,020

33
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,110

okay you can even mix and match okay so

34
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
okay you can even mix and match okay so
 

35
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,189
okay you can even mix and match okay so
this is a match this square bracket

36
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
this is a match this square bracket
 

37
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,830
this is a match this square bracket
means a list yeah the list means you can

38
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
means a list yeah the list means you can
 

39
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,390
means a list yeah the list means you can
change it

40
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
change it
 

41
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,310
change it
it's mutable but if you do it if you do

right if you do this uh

46
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
right if you do this uh
 

47
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,749
right if you do this uh
what your parentheses yeah parenthesis

48
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
what your parentheses yeah parenthesis
 

49
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,350
what your parentheses yeah parenthesis
that's in math

50
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
that's in math
 

51
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,630
that's in math
parentheses these are called

52
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
parentheses these are called
 

53
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,070
parentheses these are called
racket yeah yeah or the difference

54
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
racket yeah yeah or the difference
 

55
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,950
racket yeah yeah or the difference
between cuba

56
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
between cuba
 

57
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,469
between cuba
and the list this is this is that

58
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
and the list this is this is that
 

59
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,350
and the list this is this is that
a tuper is immutable means after this

60
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
a tuper is immutable means after this
 

61
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,109
a tuper is immutable means after this
you can't change the elements

62
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
you can't change the elements
 

63
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,230
you can't change the elements
but here i can say b along

64
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
but here i can say b along
 

65
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,630
but here i can say b along
island too big yeah b 0 equals let's say

66
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
island too big yeah b 0 equals let's say
 

67
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,510
island too big yeah b 0 equals let's say
alex okay

68
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520

 

69
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,389

what happened then it will replace these

70
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
what happened then it will replace these
 

71
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:48,710
what happened then it will replace these
two

72
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
two
 

73
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:57,429
two
errors yeah not a oh

74
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439

 

75
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,469

look if c equals this two power and if

76
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
look if c equals this two power and if
 

77
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:00,950
look if c equals this two power and if
you say

78
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
you say
 

79
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,069
you say
c zero equals that

80
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
c zero equals that
 

81
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,469
c zero equals that
it's not po you're not allowed to do

82
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
it's not po you're not allowed to do
 

83
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,429
it's not po you're not allowed to do
that because

84
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
that because
 

85
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,589
that because
it's stupid you cannot change it right

86
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
it's stupid you cannot change it right
 

87
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,510
it's stupid you cannot change it right
that's the difference between two prime

88
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
that's the difference between two prime
 

89
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,190
that's the difference between two prime
and like this okay so here

90
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
and like this okay so here
 

91
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,390
and like this okay so here
uh condition product okay

92
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
uh condition product okay
 

93
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:29,670
uh condition product okay
look a

94
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680

 

95
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,670

look this is this is mathematic

96
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
look this is this is mathematic
 

97
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,990
look this is this is mathematic
condition it's not the present one right

98
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
condition it's not the present one right
 

99
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,589
condition it's not the present one right
it's not i mean i'm just saying that in

100
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
it's not i mean i'm just saying that in
 

101
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,430
it's not i mean i'm just saying that in
mathematics cartesian it's not nothing

102
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
mathematics cartesian it's not nothing
 

103
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,869
mathematics cartesian it's not nothing
to do with the present right

104
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
to do with the present right
 

105
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,869
to do with the present right
you cannot do a multiplying present

106
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
you cannot do a multiplying present
 

107
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,910
you cannot do a multiplying present
using this way

108
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
using this way
 

109
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,630
using this way
condition product a b equals one you

110
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
condition product a b equals one you
 

111
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,270
condition product a b equals one you
take this

112
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
take this
 

113
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,630
take this
you will take each element of a

114
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
you will take each element of a
 

115
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,390
you will take each element of a
and try the combination with each

116
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
and try the combination with each
 

117
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,110
and try the combination with each
element of b so what does it equal

118
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
element of b so what does it equal
 

119
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,309
element of b so what does it equal
it'll become equal to that a list yeah

120
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
it'll become equal to that a list yeah
 

121
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,790
it'll become equal to that a list yeah
not a two part a two it will be a two

122
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
not a two part a two it will be a two
 

123
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,830
not a two part a two it will be a two
plus

124
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:02,840
plus
 

125
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:12,790
plus
two

126
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800

 

127
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,830

and then a two

128
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
and then a two
 

129
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,430
and then a two
yeah and then

130
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
yeah and then
 

131
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,309
yeah and then
a three you're going and then b

132
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
a three you're going and then b
 

133
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,430
a three you're going and then b
b one got it b

134
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
b one got it b
 

135
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,670
b one got it b
two three three i got it

136
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
two three three i got it
 

137
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,589
two three three i got it
okay so what does it mean look it's just

138
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
okay so what does it mean look it's just
 

139
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,309
okay so what does it mean look it's just
a one a two a three this card this input

140
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
a one a two a three this card this input
 

141
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,550
a one a two a three this card this input
b one p two p three all these are

142
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
b one p two p three all these are
 

143
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,509

written in

144
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
written in
 

145
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,470
written in
two plus right doesn't make sense so

146
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
two plus right doesn't make sense so
 

147
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,670
two plus right doesn't make sense so
what can you tell me what's the

148
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
what can you tell me what's the
 

149
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:51,990
what can you tell me what's the
cartesian product

150
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000

 

151
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,270

you're not understanding you're just

152
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
you're not understanding you're just
 

153
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,589
you're not understanding you're just
guessing okay so what's what's this

154
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
guessing okay so what's what's this
 

155
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,270
guessing okay so what's what's this
uh

156
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280

 

157
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,470

doesn't make sense can you tell me oh

158
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
doesn't make sense can you tell me oh
 

159
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,990
doesn't make sense can you tell me oh
okay so this is car wait okay so this is

160
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
okay so this is car wait okay so this is
 

161
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,990
okay so this is car wait okay so this is
cheaper and this is this but you just

162
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
cheaper and this is this but you just
 

163
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,910
cheaper and this is this but you just
rub it out anyway

164
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
rub it out anyway
 

165
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,429
rub it out anyway
people is immutable i think

166
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
people is immutable i think
 

167
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,830
people is immutable i think
i think and this one is cuba is

168
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
i think and this one is cuba is
 

169
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,949
i think and this one is cuba is
immutable

170
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
immutable
 

171
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,390
immutable
at least it's mutable that's the

172
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
at least it's mutable that's the
 

173
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,909
at least it's mutable that's the
difference yeah yeah yeah i know where

174
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
difference yeah yeah yeah i know where
 

175
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:20,229
difference yeah yeah yeah i know where
you

176
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
you
 

177
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,189
you
multiply these two condition products

178
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
multiply these two condition products
 

179
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:23,909
multiply these two condition products
how do you

180
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
how do you
 

181
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:31,590
how do you
okay okay s

182
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600

 

183
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,350

yeah i got it baby okay so it's

184
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
yeah i got it baby okay so it's
 

185
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,990
yeah i got it baby okay so it's
in par in prison we have this you know

186
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
in par in prison we have this you know
 

187
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,110
in par in prison we have this you know
you can do this you

188
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
you can do this you
 

189
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,230
you can do this you
you have an eta tool iterated to a dot

190
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
you have an eta tool iterated to a dot
 

191
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,230
you have an eta tool iterated to a dot
product to this exactly okay

192

product to this exactly okay
 

193
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,150
product to this exactly okay
okay so you can do this you can from

194
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
okay so you can do this you can from
 

195
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,830
okay so you can do this you can from
from eta to a

196
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840

 

197
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,510

import product

198

import product
 

199
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,110
import product
and then we can use this product

200
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
and then we can use this product
 

201
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,629
and then we can use this product
function so you can say

202
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639
function so you can say
 

203
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,670
function so you can say
look you can do this

204
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
look you can do this
 

205
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,029
look you can do this
a equals list all right because

206
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
a equals list all right because
 

207
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,110
a equals list all right because
this product returns a generator you

208
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
this product returns a generator you
 

209
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,950
this product returns a generator you
know the year thing it doesn't actually

210
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
know the year thing it doesn't actually
 

211
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,230
know the year thing it doesn't actually
give you a list

212
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
give you a list
 

213
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,070
give you a list
but you need to convert it to the list

214
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
but you need to convert it to the list
 

215
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,270
but you need to convert it to the list
or tutor yeah

216
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
or tutor yeah
 

217
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,150
or tutor yeah
list and then you can do this product

218
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
list and then you can do this product
 

219
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,590
list and then you can do this product
and you'll tell me what's the outcome

220
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
and you'll tell me what's the outcome
 

221
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,230
and you'll tell me what's the outcome
okay

222
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
okay
 

223
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,070
okay
product let's say

224
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
product let's say
 

225
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,430
product let's say
one two and then another one three

226
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
one two and then another one three
 

227
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,189
one two and then another one three
four like that so what's a

228
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
four like that so what's a
 

229
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,230
four like that so what's a
what does a become 21

230
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
what does a become 21
 

231
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,189
what does a become 21
what's a a is a list yeah yeah list of

232
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
what's a a is a list yeah yeah list of
 

233

can you tell me a is
 

241
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,230
can you tell me a is
then tell me at least what 24

242
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
then tell me at least what 24
 

243
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,830
then tell me at least what 24
no cartesian product i just told you

244
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
no cartesian product i just told you
 

245
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,110
no cartesian product i just told you
remember that the thing you don't

246
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
remember that the thing you don't
 

247
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,270
remember that the thing you don't
understand now

248
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280

 

249
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,309

yeah it should be a one three

250
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
yeah it should be a one three
 

251
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,430
yeah it should be a one three
and what's next two four oh one four

one four two three three four yeah i got
it

256
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
it
 

257
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,430
it
okay yeah got it so look it's this

258
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
okay yeah got it so look it's this
 

259
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,430
okay yeah got it so look it's this
product of these it will take

260
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
product of these it will take
 

261
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,469
product of these it will take
each element of one one three one four

262
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
each element of one one three one four
 

263
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:20,950
each element of one one three one four
and two

264
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
and two
 

265
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,629
and two
three two four yeah easy to understand

266
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
three two four yeah easy to understand
 

267
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,950
three two four yeah easy to understand
combination and then you become each one

268
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
combination and then you become each one
 

269
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,550
combination and then you become each one
is a two part

270
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
is a two part
 

271
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,270
is a two part
and then it returns a list of a

272
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
and then it returns a list of a
 

273
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,189
and then it returns a list of a
generator for this each tuber you can

274
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
generator for this each tuber you can
 

275
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,950
generator for this each tuber you can
convert it to a list okay that's what he

276
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
convert it to a list okay that's what he
 

277
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,710
convert it to a list okay that's what he
actually does i'm quick

278
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
actually does i'm quick
 

279
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,430
actually does i'm quick
so if i will i want to implement this

280
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
so if i will i want to implement this
 

281
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,629
so if i will i want to implement this
product okay

282
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
product okay
 

283
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,909
product okay
it's given two things and you can change

284
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
it's given two things and you can change
 

285
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,790
it's given two things and you can change
it to

286
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
it to
 

287
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,950
it to
to list to tuper it doesn't matter yeah

288
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
to list to tuper it doesn't matter yeah
 

289
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,550
to list to tuper it doesn't matter yeah
it still gives this result okay

290
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
it still gives this result okay
 

291
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,469
it still gives this result okay
this makes sense remember the curly

292
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
this makes sense remember the curly
 

293
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,550
this makes sense remember the curly
brace and uh another curly brace the

294
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
brace and uh another curly brace the
 

295
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,029
brace and uh another curly brace the
bracket

296
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
bracket
 

297
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,469
bracket
the punches and the square bracket okay

298
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
the punches and the square bracket okay
 

299
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,830
the punches and the square bracket okay
okay now we want the left angle is 24

300
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840

 

301
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,350

two times it together yeah it's

302
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
two times it together yeah it's
 

303
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,870
two times it together yeah it's
factorial

304
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
factorial
 

305
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,270
factorial
okay so now look let's define if this is

306
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
okay so now look let's define if this is
 

307
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,870
okay so now look let's define if this is
a p function right

308
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
a p function right
 

309
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,510
a p function right
a b okay to restore cuba this could be

310
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
a b okay to restore cuba this could be
 

311
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,790
a b okay to restore cuba this could be
tilde only

312
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
tilde only
 

313
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,830
tilde only
and i cut that okay so how look

314
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
and i cut that okay so how look
 

315
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,870
and i cut that okay so how look
we can join

316
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880

 

317
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,550

you want to go to the first element

318
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
you want to go to the first element
 

319
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,309
you want to go to the first element
which is a

320
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
which is a
 

321
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,749
which is a
and then second one for j

322
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
and then second one for j
 

323
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,950
and then second one for j
in b

324
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960

 

325
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,390

and then yeah remember this q one u

326
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
and then yeah remember this q one u
 

327
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,309
and then yeah remember this q one u
okay here's the two of what can you tell

328
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
okay here's the two of what can you tell
 

329
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,820
okay here's the two of what can you tell
me yeah the cuber one

330
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:37,830

00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
and i is for the element in in the first
 

337
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,390
and i is for the element in in the first
in a b j is for the element in b

338
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
in a b j is for the element in b
 

339
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,230
in a b j is for the element in b
so yeah come on it's very obvious

340
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
so yeah come on it's very obvious
 

341
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:04,390
so yeah come on it's very obvious
a a is a list i

342
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400

 

343
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,029

does it make sense when you hear the one

344
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
does it make sense when you hear the one
 

345
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,790
does it make sense when you hear the one
this is the tuple yeah

346
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
this is the tuple yeah
 

347
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,830
this is the tuple yeah
looks weird okay it makes sense what's

348
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
looks weird okay it makes sense what's
 

349
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,629
looks weird okay it makes sense what's
the

350
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
the
 

351
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,830
the
if there are n elements in a m elements

352
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
if there are n elements in a m elements
 

353
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,909
if there are n elements in a m elements
in b what's the function

354
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919

 

355
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,029

okay that's what i said yeah

356
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
okay that's what i said yeah
 

357
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,790
okay that's what i said yeah
remember this year thing what's the

358
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
remember this year thing what's the
 

359
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,469
remember this year thing what's the
earth thing can you tell me what

360
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
earth thing can you tell me what
 

361
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,670
earth thing can you tell me what
yes i promised me right now

362
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
yes i promised me right now
 

363
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,350
yes i promised me right now
like like uh mom mom mommy said

364
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
like like uh mom mom mommy said
 

365
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,350
like like uh mom mom mommy said
he's gonna he's gonna give us five

366
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
he's gonna he's gonna give us five
 

367
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,870
he's gonna he's gonna give us five
pounds on fridays

368
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
pounds on fridays
 

369
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:47,790
pounds on fridays
okay

370
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:47,800

 

371
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:57,590

[Music]

372
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600

 

373
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,269

quiet okay so this project thing eric uh

374
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
quiet okay so this project thing eric uh
 

375
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,310
quiet okay so this project thing eric uh
actually italian product can support

376
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
actually italian product can support
 

377
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,389
actually italian product can support
more than two elements yeah all right

378
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
more than two elements yeah all right
 

379
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,990
more than two elements yeah all right
look you know what

380
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
look you know what
 

381
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,790
look you know what
you know this mean function yeah when

382
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
you know this mean function yeah when
 

383
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,269
you know this mean function yeah when
you take

384
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
you take
 

385
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,389
you take
mean from your one two now this is

386
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
mean from your one two now this is
 

387
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,110
mean from your one two now this is
mathematic

388
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
mathematic
 

389
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,110
mathematic
it's impossible different mean version

390
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
it's impossible different mean version
 

391
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,710
it's impossible different mean version
one two it returns one

392
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
one two it returns one
 

393
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,350
one two it returns one
one okay and then you can look you can

394
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
one okay and then you can look you can
 

395
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,310
one okay and then you can look you can
say one

396
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
say one
 

397
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,190
say one
three four or five you can keep as many

398
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
three four or five you can keep as many
 

399
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,910
three four or five you can keep as many
it's a

400
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
it's a
 

401
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,750
it's a
parameters it's not a list you have to

402
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
parameters it's not a list you have to
 

403
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,509
parameters it's not a list you have to
look at their four parameters they're

404
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
look at their four parameters they're
 

405
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,949
look at their four parameters they're
two parameters and then

406
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
two parameters and then
 

407
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,509
two parameters and then
this will still work right gives one so

408
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
this will still work right gives one so
 

409
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,110
this will still work right gives one so
the point is that if

410
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
the point is that if
 

411
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,670
the point is that if
the number of parameters yeah we call it

412
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
the number of parameters yeah we call it
 

413
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,430
the number of parameters yeah we call it
a number of parameters

414
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
a number of parameters
 

415
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,750
a number of parameters
it's not fixed remember in python if you

416
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
it's not fixed remember in python if you
 

417
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,550
it's not fixed remember in python if you
want to define

418
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
want to define
 

419
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,269
want to define
define mean a b

420
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279

 

421
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,590

and you can say if a smaller than b

422
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
and you can say if a smaller than b
 

423
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,790
and you can say if a smaller than b
return

424
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
return
 

425
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,389
return
what a ass return b

426
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
what a ass return b
 

427
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,190
what a ass return b
yeah but here look

428
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200

 

429
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,910

it's it's already fixed too so how does

430
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
it's it's already fixed too so how does
 

431
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,630
it's it's already fixed too so how does
this work

432
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
this work
 

433
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,030
this work
because look it supports more than two

434
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
because look it supports more than two
 

435
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,829
because look it supports more than two
right

436
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
right
 

437
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,310
right
and five six etcetera and the thing is

438
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
and five six etcetera and the thing is
 

439
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,829
and five six etcetera and the thing is
that you can use the

440
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
that you can use the
 

441
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,110
that you can use the
very uh variant argument so

442
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
very uh variant argument so
 

443
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,910
very uh variant argument so
you define it as this mean and then you

444
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
you define it as this mean and then you
 

445
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,949
you define it as this mean and then you
put a star here

446
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
put a star here
 

447
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,630
put a star here
star nums okay

448
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
star nums okay
 

449
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,790
star nums okay
i know how does it do so you can say

450
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
i know how does it do so you can say
 

451
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,230
i know how does it do so you can say
okay

452
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
okay
 

453
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,870
okay
star means that these nums you can give

454
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
star means that these nums you can give
 

455
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,630
star means that these nums you can give
as many

456
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
as many
 

457
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,030
as many
parameters as possible right it does not

458
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
parameters as possible right it does not
 

459
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,430
parameters as possible right it does not
have to be one two fixed number you can

460
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
have to be one two fixed number you can
 

461
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,910
have to be one two fixed number you can
give

462
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
give
 

463
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,949
give
two three five a hundred right yeah

464
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
two three five a hundred right yeah
 

465
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,710
two three five a hundred right yeah
you still work then how do you do it

466
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
you still work then how do you do it
 

467
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,389
you still work then how do you do it
look you can say

468
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
look you can say
 

469
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,110
look you can say
uh answer at the beginning we give a

470
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
uh answer at the beginning we give a
 

471
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,389
uh answer at the beginning we give a
very big number

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
very big number
 

473
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,990
very big number
yeah infinity right and i look for

474
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
yeah infinity right and i look for
 

475
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,590
yeah infinity right and i look for
i in nouns

476
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
i in nouns
 

477
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,829
i in nouns
i know how do i do with this answer

478
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
i know how do i do with this answer

yes answer equals what what and then
 

483
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,269
yes answer equals what what and then
answer can you tell me we want to try to

484
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
answer can you tell me we want to try to
 

485
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,190
answer can you tell me we want to try to
find the minimum of the

486
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
find the minimum of the
 

487
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,389
find the minimum of the
of of all the elements in numbers okay

488
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
of of all the elements in numbers okay
 

489
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,829
of of all the elements in numbers okay
it's not there come on you need to

490
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
it's not there come on you need to
 

491
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,630
it's not there come on you need to
understand follow me

492
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
understand follow me
 

493
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:18,470
understand follow me
uh okay so i want to get

494
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480

 

495
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,590

okay let's define this as a f function

496
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
okay let's define this as a f function
 

497
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,949
okay let's define this as a f function
okay so this mean

498
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
okay so this mean
 

499
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,150
okay so this mean
is the anawa meanwhile

500
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
is the anawa meanwhile
 

501
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,790
is the anawa meanwhile
what i want to get the means of all

502
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
what i want to get the means of all
 

503
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,150
what i want to get the means of all
numbers

504
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
numbers
 

505
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,430
numbers
so what we know

506
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440

 

507
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,550

is all the numbers in

508
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
is all the numbers in
 

509
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,990
is all the numbers in
i and then wha

510
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000

 

511
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,509

why is the numbers i want to get the

512
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
why is the numbers i want to get the
 

513
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,069
why is the numbers i want to get the
answer come on answer

514
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
answer come on answer
 

515
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,110
answer come on answer
eric do you understand you understand

516
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
eric do you understand you understand
 

517
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,990
eric do you understand you understand
and then

518
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
and then
 

519
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,670
and then
i never really tend to answer okay

520
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
i never really tend to answer okay
 

521
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,350
i never really tend to answer okay
because the answer is the maximum at the

522
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
because the answer is the maximum at the
 

523
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,150
because the answer is the maximum at the
beginning

524
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
beginning
 

525
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,150
beginning
and then we want to get the minimum yeah

526
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
and then we want to get the minimum yeah
 

527
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,550
and then we want to get the minimum yeah
keep updating with the minimum right

528
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
keep updating with the minimum right
 

529
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,629
keep updating with the minimum right
yeah so the point here is we're using

530
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
yeah so the point here is we're using
 

531
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,990
yeah so the point here is we're using
these to

532
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
these to
 

533
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,910
these to
to denote the variance number of the

534
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
to denote the variance number of the
 

535
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,110
to denote the variance number of the
parameters got it

536
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120

 

537
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,590

okay so the cartesian product coming

538
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
okay so the cartesian product coming
 

539
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,310
okay so the cartesian product coming
back to this interpolator

540
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
back to this interpolator
 

541
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,190
back to this interpolator
either to us dot product

542
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
either to us dot product
 

543
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,949
either to us dot product
you can take as many parameters as you

544
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
you can take as many parameters as you
 

545
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:29,350
you can take as many parameters as you
want

546
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
want
 

547
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,790
want
so remember we remember we we

548
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
so remember we remember we we
 

549
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,430
so remember we remember we we
have these the four only it doesn't work

550
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
have these the four only it doesn't work
 

551
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,710
have these the four only it doesn't work
right remember the first

552
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
right remember the first
 

553
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,310
right remember the first
iteration we have for for i in

554
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
iteration we have for for i in
 

555
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,990
iteration we have for for i in
a for j in b remember

556
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
a for j in b remember
 

557
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,269
a for j in b remember
yeah and yes

558
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279

 

559
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,430

i say this wouldn't work because it will

560
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
i say this wouldn't work because it will
 

561
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,350
i say this wouldn't work because it will
make it

562
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
make it
 

563
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,430
make it
contain more than three elements yeah

564
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
contain more than three elements yeah
 

565
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,949
contain more than three elements yeah
you could pretend that a

566
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
you could pretend that a
 

567
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,430
you could pretend that a
b c okay it's still is there

568
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
b c okay it's still is there
 

569
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,350
b c okay it's still is there
this only works for two elements so how

570
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
this only works for two elements so how
 

571
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,949
this only works for two elements so how
do you

572
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
do you
 

573
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,990
do you
calculate the condition product for

574
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
calculate the condition product for
 

575
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,470
calculate the condition product for
three elements like three one two

576
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
three elements like three one two
 

577
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,069
three elements like three one two
and then three four

578
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
and then three four
 

579
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,829
and then three four
and then five six what's the condition

580
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
and then five six what's the condition
 

581
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,829
and then five six what's the condition
for that can you guess

582
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839

 

583
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,790

uh

584
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
uh
 

585
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,910
uh
three five one three five

586
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
three five one three five
 

587
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,030
three five one three five

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
two three five two three six
 

591
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:43,110
two three five two three six
two four five two

592
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120

 

593
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,230

right one four five one four

594
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
right one four five one four
 

595
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,829
right one four five one four
six two four three five two three six

597
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,430
six two four three five two three six
two four five two four six okay

598
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
two four five two four six okay
 

599
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,870
two four five two four six okay
okay yeah so how do we

600
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
okay yeah so how do we
 

601
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,269
okay yeah so how do we
write uh how to implement this product

602
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
write uh how to implement this product
 

603
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,949
write uh how to implement this product
supporting the variance

604
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
supporting the variance
 

605
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,990
supporting the variance
of the list abcd you know

606
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,000

 

607
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,990

how can we do this if we're not

608
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
how can we do this if we're not
 

609
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,990
how can we do this if we're not
supposing that we can do this

610
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000
supposing that we can do this
 

611
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,590
supposing that we can do this
for i in a

612
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
for i in a
 

613
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,189
for i in a
for j in b and then for

614
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
for j in b and then for
 

615
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,550
for j in b and then for
k in c yeah if you are not already know

616
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
k in c yeah if you are not already know
 

617
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,550
k in c yeah if you are not already know
that three you can do this and then yeah

618
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
that three you can do this and then yeah
 

619
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,550
that three you can do this and then yeah
you know

620
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560

 

621
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,269

yeah that's it but we are we are not

622
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
yeah that's it but we are we are not
 

623
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,269
yeah that's it but we are we are not
sure how many of them so how can we

624
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
sure how many of them so how can we
 

625
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,949
sure how many of them so how can we
define for that

626
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
define for that
 

627
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,829
define for that
look at this please what should i put

628
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
look at this please what should i put
 

629
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,189
look at this please what should i put
here

630
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
here
 

631
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,389
here
okay hey but we how many

632
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
okay hey but we how many
 

633
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,790
okay hey but we how many
we want to put a symbol here to know

634
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
we want to put a symbol here to know
 

635
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,629
we want to put a symbol here to know
that there could be many of them

636
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
that there could be many of them
 

637
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,670
that there could be many of them
oh the star sign starts and the value

638
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
oh the star sign starts and the value
 

639
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,150
oh the star sign starts and the value
so you can pass as many as you want okay

640
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
so you can pass as many as you want okay
 

641
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,430
so you can pass as many as you want okay
and now

642
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
and now
 

643
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,110
and now
we want to define the different search

644
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
we want to define the different search
 

645
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,829
we want to define the different search
yeah we're using this definition

646
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839
yeah we're using this definition
 

647
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,150
yeah we're using this definition
remember the

648
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
remember the
 

649
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,590
remember the
fs the beginning will be left or the

650
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
fs the beginning will be left or the
 

651
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,550
fs the beginning will be left or the
left

652
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
left
 

653
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,829
left
and then the current i show you

654
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
and then the current i show you
 

655
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,030
and then the current i show you
what does it mean okay so look

656
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
what does it mean okay so look
 

657
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,189
what does it mean okay so look
a a will be you can convert

658
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
a a will be you can convert
 

659
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,910
a a will be you can convert
a will be passing like a list and you

660
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
a will be passing like a list and you
 

661
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,269
a will be passing like a list and you
look if you if

662
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
look if you if
 

663
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,389
look if you if
it's one two

664
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
it's one two
 

665
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,590
it's one two
three four five six yeah

666
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
three four five six yeah
 

667
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,790
three four five six yeah
i i actually is can be like can be

668
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
i i actually is can be like can be
 

669
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,870
i i actually is can be like can be
treated like a and a list

670
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
treated like a and a list
 

671
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,069
treated like a and a list
and then here left is the which

672
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
and then here left is the which
 

673
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,550
and then here left is the which
which uh we start from the first one

674
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
which uh we start from the first one
 

675
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,590
which uh we start from the first one
right

676
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
right
 

677
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,430
right
when we reach the last one we know we

678
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
when we reach the last one we know we
 

679
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,030
when we reach the last one we know we
have the answer so

680
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
have the answer so
 

681
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,670
have the answer so
for each one i can i can iterate the

682
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
for each one i can i can iterate the
 

683
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,629
for each one i can i can iterate the
possibility

684
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
possibility
 

685
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,389
possibility
of all the numbers here you'll be one

686
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
of all the numbers here you'll be one
 

687
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,990
of all the numbers here you'll be one
two right all right

688
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
two right all right
 

689
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,590
two right all right
doesn't make sense here look if

690
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
doesn't make sense here look if
 

691
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,790
doesn't make sense here look if
left equal equal length a

692
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
left equal equal length a
 

693
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,269
left equal equal length a
if we are reaching the end yeah we do it

694
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
if we are reaching the end yeah we do it
 

695
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,389
if we are reaching the end yeah we do it
reaching the end

696
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
reaching the end
 

697
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,110
reaching the end
right remember we talked about this kind

698
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
right remember we talked about this kind
 

699
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,550
right remember we talked about this kind
of algorithm before right it's quite

700
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
of algorithm before right it's quite
 

701
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,350
of algorithm before right it's quite
similar

702
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
similar
 

703
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,110
similar
for currency if we if the

704
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
for currency if we if the
 

705
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,590
for currency if we if the
left point array if the left pointer

706
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,600
left point array if the left pointer
 

707
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,350
left point array if the left pointer
reaching the end and we have a current

708
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
reaching the end and we have a current
 

709
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,189
reaching the end and we have a current
solution so we can

710
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
solution so we can
 

711
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,110
solution so we can
yield here yeah yeah we converted this

712
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
yield here yeah yeah we converted this
 

713
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,470
yield here yeah yeah we converted this
current to two power two plus current

714
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
current to two power two plus current
 

715
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,749
current to two power two plus current
and then return okay

716
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
and then return okay
 

717
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,790
and then return okay
now we are at left alright so how many

718
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
now we are at left alright so how many
 

719
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,310
now we are at left alright so how many
possibilities here in the a

720
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
possibilities here in the a
 

721
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,910
possibilities here in the a
left yeah so we want to

722
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
left yeah so we want to
 

723
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,110
left yeah so we want to
fall right for i

724
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
fall right for i
 

725
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,790
fall right for i
in a left right

726
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
in a left right
 

727
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,470
in a left right
all right does it make sense yeah

728
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480

 

729
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,910

so look this is one two

730
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
so look this is one two
 

731
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,870
so look this is one two
left is here yeah another three four

732
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
left is here yeah another three four
 

733
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,069
left is here yeah another three four
okay very good left is here right

734
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
okay very good left is here right
 

735
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,430
okay very good left is here right
a left is this this this thing and a

736
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
a left is this this this thing and a
 

737
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:57,910
a left is this this this thing and a
left

738
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
left
 

739
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,310
left
i will be one will be two and then i

740
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320
i will be one will be two and then i
 

741
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,110
i will be one will be two and then i
need to do

742
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
need to do
 

743
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,309
need to do
one yeah

744
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
one yeah
 

745
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,669
one yeah
from d f s

746
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
from d f s
 

747
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,510
from d f s
look at this ears no i want to years

748
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:09,520
look at this ears no i want to years
 

749
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,029
look at this ears no i want to years
from what dss

750
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
from what dss
 

751
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,390
from what dss
and left plus one

752
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400
and left plus one
 

753
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,470
and left plus one
and currently if i choose i and i know

754
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
and currently if i choose i and i know
 

755
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,829
and currently if i choose i and i know
because

756
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
because
 

757
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,029
because
plus i

758
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:23,039
plus i
 

759
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,390
plus i
right and then here will be and then

760
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
right and then here will be and then
 

761
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:44,830
right and then here will be and then
at the beginning i will yeah it's from

762
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:44,840

 

763
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,549

is uh easy to understand or is not

764
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559
is uh easy to understand or is not
 

765
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,110
is uh easy to understand or is not
yes no yeah it is uh there's lots of

766
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
yes no yeah it is uh there's lots of
 

767
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,150
yes no yeah it is uh there's lots of
views

768
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
views
 

769
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,909
views
yeah okay so so this is the dfs

770
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
yeah okay so so this is the dfs
 

771
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,070
yeah okay so so this is the dfs
the left thingy is at the beginning is

772
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
the left thingy is at the beginning is
 

773
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,510
the left thingy is at the beginning is
here right

774
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
here right
 

775
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,029
here right
at beginning i start with the first

776
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
at beginning i start with the first
 

777
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,350
at beginning i start with the first
element right first list

778
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
element right first list
 

779
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,990
element right first list
right when it gets to the end when it

780
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
right when it gets to the end when it
 

781
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,029
right when it gets to the end when it
gets to the end

782
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
gets to the end
 

783
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,789
gets to the end
and then i know i i found a combination

784
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
and then i know i i found a combination
 

785
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,830
and then i know i i found a combination
remember

786
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
remember
 

787
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,390
remember
which is current and then get yeah this

788
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
which is current and then get yeah this
 

789
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,909
which is current and then get yeah this
make it a tuple

790
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
make it a tuple
 

791
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,310
make it a tuple
right at this point currently it's at

792
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
right at this point currently it's at
 

793
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,310
right at this point currently it's at
least at making the tuber

794
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:20,320
least at making the tuber
 

795
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,510
least at making the tuber
otherwise i'm here i'm here right

796
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
otherwise i'm here i'm here right
 

797
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,270
otherwise i'm here i'm here right
and how many possibilities for the

798
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
and how many possibilities for the
 

799
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,350
and how many possibilities for the
current one it could be one or cookie

800
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
current one it could be one or cookie
 

801
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,470
current one it could be one or cookie
two right

802
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
two right
 

803
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,710
two right
so for i in eight left will delete and

804
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
so for i in eight left will delete and
 

805
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,110
so for i in eight left will delete and
then i try to i try to move it to next

806
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
then i try to i try to move it to next
 

807
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,430
then i try to i try to move it to next
one

808
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
one
 

809
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,750
one
because it will move it to the next one

810
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
because it will move it to the next one
 

811
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,669
because it will move it to the next one
right then i move it to next one because

812
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
right then i move it to next one because
 

813
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,590
right then i move it to next one because
i can try one or two here and then move

814
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
i can try one or two here and then move
 

815
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,430
i can try one or two here and then move
it to next one

816
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
it to next one
 

817
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,070
it to next one
which is the current plus i right if i

818
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
which is the current plus i right if i
 

819
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,470
which is the current plus i right if i
choose

820
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
choose
 

821
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,270
choose
the first one yeah yeah we can have

822
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
the first one yeah yeah we can have
 

823
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,070
the first one yeah yeah we can have
another phone

824
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
another phone
 

825
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,230
another phone
uh this is the local function right that

826
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,240
uh this is the local function right that
 

827
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,430
uh this is the local function right that
makes sense here

828
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
makes sense here
 

829
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,549
makes sense here
we we choose the i for

830
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:54,559
we we choose the i for
 

831
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,669
we we choose the i for
current element and then we try to try

832
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
current element and then we try to try
 

833
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,029
current element and then we try to try
to put the next one remember

834
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
to put the next one remember
 

835
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,110
to put the next one remember
we talked about this combination right

836
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
we talked about this combination right
 

837
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,270
we talked about this combination right
combination thingy

838
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,280

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
the current choice
 

855
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,150
the current choice
once i make sure the current choice i go

856
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
once i make sure the current choice i go
 

857

will be uh
 

921
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,870
will be uh
what will build the list okay got it

922
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:26,880
what will build the list okay got it
 

923
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,670
what will build the list okay got it
okay well what's the time complexity

you're writing it too close to each

932
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080
you're writing it too close to each
 

933
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,230
you're writing it too close to each
other you should be writing here

other you should be writing here
 

935
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,909
other you should be writing here
for i and then for j here yeah and for k

936
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
for i and then for j here yeah and for k
 

937
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,669
for i and then for j here yeah and for k
here yeah you have you need to have a

space yeah
 

941
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,990
space yeah
that means that this one is belongs to

942
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
that means that this one is belongs to
 

943
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,549
that means that this one is belongs to
this right if you write it

944
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559
this right if you write it
 

945
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,270
this right if you write it
here it means therefore doesn't make
