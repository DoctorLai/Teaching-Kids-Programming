uh the ninth position saying here
 

77
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,350
uh the ninth position saying here
that's uh rc right rc

78
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
that's uh rc right rc
 

79
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,510
that's uh rc right rc
here is r here here is c

80
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
here is r here here is c
 

81
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,790
here is r here here is c
yeah and this is minus okay so it's a

82
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:22,800
yeah and this is minus okay so it's a
 

83
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,830
yeah and this is minus okay so it's a
it's a axis and i want you to tell me

84
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
it's a axis and i want you to tell me
 

85
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,229
it's a axis and i want you to tell me
that

86
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
that
 

87
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,350
that
how many the minimum number of moves

88
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
how many the minimum number of moves
 

89
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,630
how many the minimum number of moves
for it to return to the center

90
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
for it to return to the center
 

91
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,670
for it to return to the center
right yeah maybe i can draw a little bit

92
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
right yeah maybe i can draw a little bit
 

93
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,949
right yeah maybe i can draw a little bit
do you get it you'll get it yeah

94
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
do you get it you'll get it yeah
 

95
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,270
do you get it you'll get it yeah
okay so for example let's let's draw

96
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
okay so for example let's let's draw
 

97
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,229
okay so for example let's let's draw
okay so for example here is zero zero

98
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
okay so for example here is zero zero
 

99
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,229
okay so for example here is zero zero
okay let's do this

100
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
okay let's do this
 

101
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,589
okay let's do this
wait

102
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599

 

103
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,070

do another one

104
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080

 

105
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,630

it's not equal that's okay that's okay

106
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
it's not equal that's okay that's okay
 

107

so here
 

109
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,910
so here
this is original position this is a

110
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
this is original position this is a
 

111
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,550
this is original position this is a
target

112
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
target
 

113
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,589

soldier is here so how many
 

117
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,869
soldier is here so how many
moves can it jump from to this point

118
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
moves can it jump from to this point
 

119
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,670
moves can it jump from to this point
two huh oh is it two

120

okay so we get it so look if it's
 

135
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,910
okay so we get it so look if it's
unbounded

136
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
unbounded
 

137
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,910
unbounded
unbounded unlimited there's no boundary

138
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
unbounded unlimited there's no boundary
 

139
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,550
unbounded unlimited there's no boundary
of the chest i give you a number like

140
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
of the chest i give you a number like
 

141

of the chest i give you a number like
like here if i give you the answer

142
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
like here if i give you the answer
 

143
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,429
like here if i give you the answer
one zero so one

144
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
one zero so one
 

145
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,910
one zero so one
zero is this one you need to tell me is

146

zero two okay here
 

155
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,710
zero two okay here
yeah look if this is what zero

156
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
yeah look if this is what zero
 

157
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,909
yeah look if this is what zero
one two and here is zero one two

one two and here is zero one two
 

159
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,629
one two and here is zero one two
axis right yeah you go okay so it

160
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
axis right yeah you go okay so it
 

161
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,150
axis right yeah you go okay so it
doesn't make sense

162
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
doesn't make sense
 

163
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,390
doesn't make sense
the rose columns okay okay

164
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400

 

165
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,990

do you understand this problem yeah you

166

do you understand this problem yeah you
understand how can we do this

168
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
understand how can we do this
 

169
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,950
understand how can we do this
okay so for example

170
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
okay so for example
 

171
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,870
okay so for example
here as you just said yeah okay

172
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
here as you just said yeah okay
 

173
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,830
here as you just said yeah okay
yeah so you're just gonna work

174
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
yeah so you're just gonna work
 

175
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,990
yeah so you're just gonna work
backwards

176
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,000

 

177
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,870

179
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,110

yeah so any idea how we're solving

180
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120

 

181
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,629

and this how how do we solve this

182
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
and this how how do we solve this
 

183
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,110
and this how how do we solve this
problem

184
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
problem
 

185
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,029
problem
just any sort of random source will be

186
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
just any sort of random source will be
 

187
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,790
just any sort of random source will be
fine it doesn't have to be correct

188
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
fine it doesn't have to be correct
 

189
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,510
fine it doesn't have to be correct
excuse me

190
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
excuse me
 

191
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,029
excuse me
how do you solve this problem how do we

192
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
how do you solve this problem how do we
 

193
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,189
how do you solve this problem how do we
ask computer to solve this problem

194
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
ask computer to solve this problem
 

195
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,980
ask computer to solve this problem
given uh

196
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:24,990

 

197

198
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440

 

199
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,909

infinity by its infinity how do we

200
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
infinity by its infinity how do we
 

201
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:40,629
infinity by its infinity how do we
perform him

202
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
perform him
 

203
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,670
perform him
i mean yeah obviously performing you can

204
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
i mean yeah obviously performing you can
 

205
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,909
i mean yeah obviously performing you can
check the next partition right

206
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
check the next partition right
 

207
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,550
check the next partition right
obviously they are unlimited here okay

208
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
obviously they are unlimited here okay
 

209
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,310
obviously they are unlimited here okay
look at the two pointers

210
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
look at the two pointers
 

211
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,749
look at the two pointers
no look look the horse here and it has

212
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
no look look the horse here and it has
 

213
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,870
no look look the horse here and it has
a position next right yeah and from each

214
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
a position next right yeah and from each
 

215
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,670
a position next right yeah and from each
location it has another a position right

216
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
location it has another a position right
 

217
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,070
location it has another a position right
right so you could blue force

218
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
right so you could blue force
 

219
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,870
right so you could blue force
each other each position until it falls

220
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
each other each position until it falls
 

221
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,909
each other each position until it falls
this right

222
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
this right
 

223
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,590
this right
right all right yeah but it takes time

224
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
right all right yeah but it takes time
 

225
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:11,909
right all right yeah but it takes time
right

226
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
right
 

227
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,309
right
because look a the move the number

228
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
because look a the move the number
 

229
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,590
because look a the move the number
a possibility for the first step is a

230
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
a possibility for the first step is a
 

231
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,629
a possibility for the first step is a
and another second two steps if the

232
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
and another second two steps if the
 

233
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,870
and another second two steps if the
knight makes two steps a times a

234
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
knight makes two steps a times a
 

235
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,309
knight makes two steps a times a
another at three step so a to the n

236
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
another at three step so a to the n
 

237
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,670
another at three step so a to the n
right yeah to the power m

238
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
right yeah to the power m
 

239
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,309
right yeah to the power m
and if this end this position is very

240
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
and if this end this position is very
 

241
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,270
and if this end this position is very
very far

242
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
very far
 

243
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,270
very far
and he could never find it but for

244
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
and he could never find it but for
 

245
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,790
and he could never find it but for
example yeah it could

246
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
example yeah it could
 

247
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,950
example yeah it could
because you're trying this position and

248
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
because you're trying this position and
 

249
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,029
because you're trying this position and
randomly you don't know where you

250
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
randomly you don't know where you
 

251
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,870
randomly you don't know where you
you want to go right when i don't know

252
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
you want to go right when i don't know
 

253
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,550
you want to go right when i don't know
where to go am i right yeah

254
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
where to go am i right yeah
 

255
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,029
where to go am i right yeah
so and the other thing is that it could

256
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
so and the other thing is that it could
 

257
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,589
so and the other thing is that it could
repeat

258
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
repeat
 

259
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,150
repeat
if you jump it here and the next time

260
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
if you jump it here and the next time
 

261
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,670
if you jump it here and the next time
you don't want to jump it back right you

262
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
you don't want to jump it back right you
 

263
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,589
you don't want to jump it back right you
need to remember where you already

264
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
need to remember where you already
 

265
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,790
need to remember where you already
jumped right all right

266
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
jumped right all right
 

267
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,870
jumped right all right
and how can we solve this problem we can

268
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
and how can we solve this problem we can
 

269
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,790
and how can we solve this problem we can
use the

270
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
use the
 

271
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,150
use the
what notebook yeah the head shapes

272
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
what notebook yeah the head shapes
 

273
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,589
what notebook yeah the head shapes
remember the the moves we have

274
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
remember the the moves we have
 

275
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,230
remember the the moves we have
we have visited but the thing is this

276
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
we have visited but the thing is this
 

277
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,790
we have visited but the thing is this
board is

278
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
board is
 

279
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,189
board is
unlimited so it doesn't make sense i

280
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
unlimited so it doesn't make sense i
 

281
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,950
unlimited so it doesn't make sense i
mean it's not feasible to

282
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
mean it's not feasible to
 

283
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,350
mean it's not feasible to
to use the search right because you

284
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
to use the search right because you
 

285
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,270
to use the search right because you
you're going to try to remember all

286
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
you're going to try to remember all
 

287
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,070
you're going to try to remember all
those

288
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
those
 

289
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,270
those
moves eric we have visited and that's

290
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
moves eric we have visited and that's
 

291
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,189
moves eric we have visited and that's
going to be very inefficient right

292
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
going to be very inefficient right
 

293
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:33,990
going to be very inefficient right
because if

294
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
because if
 

295
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,670
because if
if r and c if if this initial location

296
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
if r and c if if this initial location
 

297
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,189
if r and c if if this initial location
is a minion

298
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
is a minion
 

299
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,950
is a minion
all right a minion a minion step far

300
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
all right a minion a minion step far
 

301
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,510
all right a minion a minion step far
away

302
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
away
 

303
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,550
away
from the original so you're just

304
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
from the original so you're just
 

305
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,270
from the original so you're just
randomly

306
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
randomly
 

307
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,270
randomly
walking in eight directions for example

308
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
walking in eight directions for example
 

309
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,270
walking in eight directions for example
here you're here right all right look

310
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
here you're here right all right look
 

311
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,070
here you're here right all right look
look at me

312

look at me
 

313
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,749
look at me
don't don't don't like you need to

314
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
don't don't don't like you need to
 

315
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,430
don't don't don't like you need to
answer here right

316
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
answer here right
 

317
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,150
answer here right
you don't you're going to expand your

318
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
you don't you're going to expand your
 

319
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,589
you don't you're going to expand your
search here

320
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
search here
 

321
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,070
search here
and then search here yeah it's going to

322
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
and then search here yeah it's going to
 

323
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,990
and then search here yeah it's going to
take time and time and time until you

324
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
take time and time and time until you
 

325
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,189
take time and time and time until you
find this right

326
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
find this right
 

327
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,869
find this right
right you can use the preferred search

328
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
right you can use the preferred search
 

329
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,550
right you can use the preferred search
or definite search right

330
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
or definite search right
 

331
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,230
or definite search right
all right yeah breakfast searching that

332
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
all right yeah breakfast searching that
 

333
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,189
all right yeah breakfast searching that
first search am right

334
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199

 

335
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,589

yeah but that's going to take forever am

336
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
yeah but that's going to take forever am
 

337
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,189
yeah but that's going to take forever am
i

338
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
i
 

339
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,830
i
all right yeah okay so can we do this

340
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
all right yeah okay so can we do this
 

341
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,869
all right yeah okay so can we do this
mathematically

342
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879

 

343
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,629

all right stop drawing harry

344
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639

 

345
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,509

can we do this uh in a better way any

346
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
can we do this uh in a better way any
 

347
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,790
can we do this uh in a better way any
idea

348
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
idea
 

349
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,469
idea
do you know what i'm talking about why

350
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
do you know what i'm talking about why
 

351
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,909
do you know what i'm talking about why
this is not

352
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
this is not
 

353
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,269
this is not
okay this is this approach is not very

354
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
okay this is this approach is not very
 

355
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,350
okay this is this approach is not very
efficient yeah

356
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
efficient yeah
 

357
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,430
efficient yeah
if if i tell you okay

358
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440

 

359
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,509

if i tell you if this board is limited

360
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
if i tell you if this board is limited
 

361
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,509
if i tell you if this board is limited
if like it's a hundred times a hundred

362
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
if like it's a hundred times a hundred
 

363
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,150
if like it's a hundred times a hundred
right you want to place the knight in a

364
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
right you want to place the knight in a
 

365
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,829
right you want to place the knight in a
board with a hundred and hundred and

366
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
board with a hundred and hundred and
 

367
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,630
board with a hundred and hundred and
then you

368
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
then you
 

369
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,590
then you
tell me how many what's the mean number

370
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
tell me how many what's the mean number
 

371
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,870
tell me how many what's the mean number
of moves

372
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
of moves
 

373
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,509
of moves
from this position back to the original

374
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
from this position back to the original
 

375
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,389
from this position back to the original
to left

376
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
to left
 

377
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,230
to left
top top left corner right

378
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
top top left corner right
 

379
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,750
top top left corner right
then we can do the pressure search in

380
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
then we can do the pressure search in
 

381
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,070
then we can do the pressure search in
the first and right

382
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
the first and right
 

383
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,150
the first and right
side side yeah if it's like this far

384
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
side side yeah if it's like this far
 

385
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,310
side side yeah if it's like this far
yeah we want to move closer to it

386
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
yeah we want to move closer to it
 

387
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,509
yeah we want to move closer to it
yeah whether yes yes exactly we want to

388
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
yeah whether yes yes exactly we want to
 

389
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,509
yeah whether yes yes exactly we want to
move closer

390
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
move closer
 

391
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,070
move closer
okay so what i'm saying like if the

392
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
okay so what i'm saying like if the
 

393
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,190
okay so what i'm saying like if the
search space

394
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
search space
 

395
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,590

i'm saying why this data search

396
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
i'm saying why this data search
 

397
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,949
i'm saying why this data search

do you get it if the search space is

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,509

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,949
yeah because you've got the unlimited
search space it's unlimited how can you

420
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
search space it's unlimited how can you
 

421
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,710
search space it's unlimited how can you
search in the unlimited

422
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
search in the unlimited
 

423
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,269
search in the unlimited
thing right but if i tell you that this

424
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
thing right but if i tell you that this
 

425
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,350
thing right but if i tell you that this
board is limited like 100 times 100.

426
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
board is limited like 100 times 100.
 

427
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,150
board is limited like 100 times 100.
yeah i know maybe 10 times 10 of 100

428
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
yeah i know maybe 10 times 10 of 100
 

429
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,269
yeah i know maybe 10 times 10 of 100
positions yeah 10 times 10 yeah

430
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
positions yeah 10 times 10 yeah
 

431
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,790
positions yeah 10 times 10 yeah
then you can do this there for such

432
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
then you can do this there for such
 

433
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,710
then you can do this there for such

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
you know you you don't need to check
 

437
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,110
you know you you don't need to check

right all right and then you know it's a

00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
right all right and then you know it's a
 

441
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,190

hundred times

442
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200

the breakfast search you have different
 

449
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,550
the breakfast search you have different
first

450
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
first
 

451
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,509
first
yeah until you find the path to the

452
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
yeah until you find the path to the
 

453
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,949
yeah until you find the path to the
shortest path between

454
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
shortest path between
 

455
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,150

any point to here all right doesn't make

456
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
any point to here all right doesn't make
 

457
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,870
any point to here all right doesn't make
sense

458
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
sense
 

459
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,190
sense
okay so now yeah you mentioned a very

460
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
okay so now yeah you mentioned a very
 

461
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,550
okay so now yeah you mentioned a very
good point is that

462
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
good point is that
 

463
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,750
good point is that
we're here yeah if if look

464
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
we're here yeah if if look
 

465
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,990
we're here yeah if if look
at the beginning this position can be

466
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000
at the beginning this position can be
 

467

00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
look all right look at this axis yes x
 

473
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,069
look all right look at this axis yes x
yes y

474
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
yes y
 

475
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,710
yes y
right yeah it could be negative yeah

476
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
right yeah it could be negative yeah
 

477
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,470
right yeah it could be negative yeah
these are the negative

478
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
these are the negative
 

479
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,750
these are the negative
space am i right negative

480
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760

481
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,350

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
but if we turn look we want to find the
 

483
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,110
but if we turn look we want to find the
position all right look we want to find

484
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
position all right look we want to find
 

485
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,670

closest position here
 

489
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,829
closest position here
is it the same as here right you can

490
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
is it the same as here right you can
 

491
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,190
is it the same as here right you can
always mirror it right

492
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
always mirror it right
 

493
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,310
always mirror it right
all right the distance between this

494
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
all right the distance between this
 

495
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,870
all right the distance between this

we can turn the negative into positive

506
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
we can turn the negative into positive
 

507
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,350
we can turn the negative into positive
right

508
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
right
 

509
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,350
right
all right because look the distance

510
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
all right because look the distance
 

511
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,470
all right because look the distance
between this point

512
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
between this point
 

513
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,069
between this point
to the origin is the same as here

514
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
to the origin is the same as here
 

515
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,230
to the origin is the same as here
doesn't make sense it's the same right

516
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
doesn't make sense it's the same right
 

517
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,190
doesn't make sense it's the same right
you can mirror it

518
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
you can mirror it
 

519
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,310
you can mirror it
so let's think about the positive cases

520
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
so let's think about the positive cases
 

521
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,310
so let's think about the positive cases
only now we can turn the negative to the

522
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
only now we can turn the negative to the
 

523
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,389
only now we can turn the negative to the
positive using which function

524
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
positive using which function
 

525
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,110
positive using which function
the mathematic what's infinity what's

526
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
the mathematic what's infinity what's
 

527
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,710
the mathematic what's infinity what's
this one here

528
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
this one here
 

529
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,990
this one here
remember what's this one here

530
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
remember what's this one here
 

531
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,069
remember what's this one here
a abs abs absolute value yeah

532
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
a abs abs absolute value yeah
 

533
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,350
a abs abs absolute value yeah
okay so look here

534
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
okay so look here
 

535
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,949
okay so look here
if we are here okay and we want to move

536
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
if we are here okay and we want to move
 

537
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,430
if we are here okay and we want to move
close to that so how many positions can

538
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,440
close to that so how many positions can
 

539
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,629
close to that so how many positions can
you can you

540
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
you can you
 

541
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,310
you can you
the previous one yeah

542
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
the previous one yeah
 

543
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,230
the previous one yeah
yeah eight no no yeah it's a

544
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
yeah eight no no yeah it's a
 

545
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,670
yeah eight no no yeah it's a
but but which two positions are closer

546
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
but but which two positions are closer
 

547
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,150
but but which two positions are closer
to this

548
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
to this
 

549
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,310
to this
and yes exactly we don't need to check

550
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:30,320
and yes exactly we don't need to check
 

551
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,509
and yes exactly we don't need to check
here because it's true

552
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
here because it's true
 

553
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,990
here because it's true
away right drifting away and this bit

554
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
away right drifting away and this bit
 

555
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,430
away right drifting away and this bit
it's further away

556
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,440
it's further away
 

557
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,190
it's further away
you can try that no no no this is far

558
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
you can try that no no no this is far
 

559
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,230
you can try that no no no this is far
it's it's fun so only these two

560
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
it's it's fun so only these two
 

561
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,990
it's it's fun so only these two
positions

562
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
positions
 

563
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,069
positions
but we are not sure which way the best

564
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
but we are not sure which way the best
 

565
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,230
but we are not sure which way the best
right all right

566
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
right all right
 

567
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,030
right all right
but we can do eliminate these two this

568
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
but we can do eliminate these two this
 

569
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,389
but we can do eliminate these two this
another six right

570
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
another six right
 

571
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,269
another six right
because it it's it has bigger distance

572
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
because it it's it has bigger distance
 

573
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,150
because it it's it has bigger distance
right it's jumping the the opposite

574
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
right it's jumping the the opposite
 

575
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,430
right it's jumping the the opposite
direction it's not the

576
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
direction it's not the
 

577
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,110
direction it's not the
thing we want we want to move closer

578
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
thing we want we want to move closer
 

579
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,350
thing we want we want to move closer
right yeah so it should be this way or

580
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
right yeah so it should be this way or
 

581
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,550
right yeah so it should be this way or
this way

582
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
this way
 

583
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,670
this way
and that's it look now what we can do is

584
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
and that's it look now what we can do is
 

585
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,190
and that's it look now what we can do is
what

586
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
what
 

587
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,949
what
let's say f function ah

588
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
let's say f function ah
 

589
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,430
let's say f function ah
x y then we can say what it's equals to

590
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
x y then we can say what it's equals to
 

591
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,550
x y then we can say what it's equals to
mean what

592
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
mean what
 

593
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,670
mean what
f x minus one y

594
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
f x minus one y
 

595
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,710
f x minus one y
minus two or f

596
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
minus two or f
 

597
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,990
minus two or f
one f one x

598
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
one f one x
 

599
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,590
one f one x
minus two why what y

600
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
minus two why what y
 

601
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,110
minus two why what y
minus what come on

602
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
minus what come on
 

603
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,470
minus what come on
one yeah minus one yeah one is two minus

604
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
one yeah minus one yeah one is two minus
 

605
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,470
one yeah minus one yeah one is two minus
and what what we need to do is plus one

606
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
and what what we need to do is plus one
 

607
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,910
and what what we need to do is plus one
mean of these two functions plus one

608
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
mean of these two functions plus one
 

609
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,269
mean of these two functions plus one
plus one from here if if these two

610
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
plus one from here if if these two
 

611
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,870
plus one from here if if these two
positions can

612
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
positions can
 

613
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,069
positions can
no we already know we already know the

614
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
no we already know we already know the
 

615
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,430
no we already know we already know the
distance between

616
00:13:59,430 --> 00:13:59,440
distance between
 

617
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,310
distance between
this these and this we pick the smallest

618
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
this these and this we pick the smallest
 

619
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,189
this these and this we pick the smallest
one

620
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
one
 

621
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,230
one
and we want to jump from how many steps

622
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
and we want to jump from how many steps
 

623
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,590
and we want to jump from how many steps
from these two to here

624
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600

 

625
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,430

so if we are we know the distance

626
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
so if we are we know the distance
 

627
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,949
so if we are we know the distance
between uh

628
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
between uh
 

629
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,829
between uh
the cost the answer from to jump from

630
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
the cost the answer from to jump from
 

631
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,990
the cost the answer from to jump from
this partition to this

632
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
this partition to this
 

633
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,870
this partition to this
and is this f x minus one y minus and

634
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
and is this f x minus one y minus and
 

635
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,910
and is this f x minus one y minus and
here is f

636
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
here is f
 

637
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,110
here is f
x minus two one minus one so in order to

638
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
x minus two one minus one so in order to
 

639
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,230
x minus two one minus one so in order to
reach this point we need to plus one

640
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
reach this point we need to plus one
 

641
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,790
reach this point we need to plus one
plus one

642
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800

 

643
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,430

yeah yeah and this is what because we

644
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
yeah yeah and this is what because we
 

645
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,110
yeah yeah and this is what because we
already know this we don't need to

646
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
already know this we don't need to
 

647
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,189
already know this we don't need to
calculate it over and over again what

648
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
calculate it over and over again what
 

649
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,030
calculate it over and over again what
does this call

650
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
does this call
 

651
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:57,110
does this call
recursion with uh

652
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120

 

653
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,550

is here right it's here all right if

654
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
is here right it's here all right if
 

655
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,790
is here right it's here all right if
it's zero and zero is zero right

656
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
it's zero and zero is zero right
 

657
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,310
it's zero and zero is zero right
if it's the release in

658
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
if it's the release in
 

659
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,509
if it's the release in
in this position

660
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519

 

661
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,069

uh in this position in this position or

uh in this position in this position or
 

663
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,790
uh in this position in this position or
here

664
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
here
 

665
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,310
here
is what is two right here

666
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
is what is two right here
 

667
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,910
is what is two right here
here here

668

here here
 

669
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,290
here here
how do you jump from this to here

670
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:27,300
how do you jump from this to here

672
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720

 

673
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,790

you can go here and then here right

674
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
you can go here and then here right
 

675
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,710
you can go here and then here right
remember it's an immediate ball right

676
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
remember it's an immediate ball right
 

677
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,990
remember it's an immediate ball right
yeah all right so two

678
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
yeah all right so two
 

679
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,189
yeah all right so two
no no no how can you go left

680
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,199
no no no how can you go left
 

681
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,470
no no no how can you go left
here go here and go here right yeah

682
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
here go here and go here right yeah
 

683
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,550
here go here and go here right yeah
okay so let's say top-down dynamic

684
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
okay so let's say top-down dynamic
 

685
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,990
okay so let's say top-down dynamic
programming mathematic

686
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
programming mathematic
 

687
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,230
programming mathematic
okay let's write this very quickly

688
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
okay let's write this very quickly
 

689
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,710
okay let's write this very quickly
there we go

690
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720

define f x y
are supposed to be different colors look

698
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
are supposed to be different colors look
 

699
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:12,790
are supposed to be different colors look
if

700
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
if
 

701
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,069
if
x equal zero and

702
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
x equal zero and
 

703
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,829
x equal zero and
y equals zero its original return one

704
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
y equals zero its original return one
 

705
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,509
y equals zero its original return one
right zero okay

706
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
right zero okay
 

707
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,670
right zero okay
if x y look at x y is in what

708
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
if x y look at x y is in what
 

709
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,470
if x y look at x y is in what
it's all positive yeah in in what cases

710
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
it's all positive yeah in in what cases
 

711
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,829
it's all positive yeah in in what cases
in these cases

712
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
in these cases
 

713
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,269
in these cases
we can say in this case one

714
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
we can say in this case one
 

715
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,629
we can say in this case one
one zero two

716
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:38,639
one zero two
 

717
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,990
one zero two
three zero two zero

718
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
three zero two zero
 

719
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,870
three zero two zero
return one two then two because he's the

720
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
return one two then two because he's the
 

721
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,749
return one two then two because he's the
biggest

722
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:45,759
biggest
 

723
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,430
biggest
yes we have the number all right

724
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
yes we have the number all right
 

725
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,030
yes we have the number all right
let's return minimum

726
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
let's return minimum
 

727
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,389
let's return minimum
of f x minus

728
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399
of f x minus
 

729
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,749
of f x minus
one what y minus one

730
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
one what y minus one
 

731
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,309
one what y minus one
t two and f x minus two

732
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
t two and f x minus two
 

733
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,549
t two and f x minus two
y plus one huh

734
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
y plus one huh
 

735
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,270
y plus one huh
first one minus one minus one

736
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280

 

737
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,029

and that's one first one outside okay

738
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
and that's one first one outside okay
 

739
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,189
and that's one first one outside okay
yeah that's it and forgot one thing

740
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
yeah that's it and forgot one thing
 

741
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,789
yeah that's it and forgot one thing
yeah because if you're not doing the

742
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
yeah because if you're not doing the
 

743
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,230
yeah because if you're not doing the
cash

744
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
cash
 

745
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,110
cash
it'll be explanational yeah because you

746
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
it'll be explanational yeah because you
 

747
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,510
it'll be explanational yeah because you
call

748
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
call
 

749
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,430
call
the calculating over and over again it's

750
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
the calculating over and over again it's
 

751
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,549
the calculating over and over again it's
like a

752
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
like a
 

753
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,190
like a
remember the fibonacci number all right

754
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
remember the fibonacci number all right
 

755
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,430
remember the fibonacci number all right
all right look

756
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440

 

757
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,789

yeah look fibonacci number f3 f4

758
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:40,799
yeah look fibonacci number f3 f4
 

759
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,110
yeah look fibonacci number f3 f4
f4 equals one f1

760
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
f4 equals one f1
 

761
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,789
f4 equals one f1
f3 plus s2

762
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
f3 plus s2
 

763
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,430
f3 plus s2
and f3 equals one f2 and f1

764
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:54,440

 

765
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,510

afterwards

766
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520

 

767
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,350

okay okay look look look at f

768
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
okay okay look look look at f
 

769
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,110
okay okay look look look at f
f2 f2 here f2 here

770
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
f2 f2 here f2 here
 

771
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,710
f2 f2 here f2 here
yeah f1 here f1 yeah even we if we don't

772
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:08,720
yeah f1 here f1 yeah even we if we don't
 

773
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,070
yeah f1 here f1 yeah even we if we don't
catch it y pad

774
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
catch it y pad
 

775
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,070
catch it y pad
this value will be calculated over and

776
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
this value will be calculated over and
 

777
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,230
this value will be calculated over and
over again right the same thing here

778
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
over again right the same thing here
 

779
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,669
over again right the same thing here
because look f x minus one f y minus two

780
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
because look f x minus one f y minus two
 

781
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,470
because look f x minus one f y minus two
yeah

782
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
yeah
 

783
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,789
yeah
eventually if you're not catching it

784
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:20,799
eventually if you're not catching it
 

785
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,070
eventually if you're not catching it
this value will be

786
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
this value will be
 

787
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,150
this value will be
calculating over and over again and this

788
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
calculating over and over again and this
 

789
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,110
calculating over and over again and this
will make the

790
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
will make the
 

791
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,710
will make the
time complexity exponential right right

792
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
time complexity exponential right right
 

793
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,230
time complexity exponential right right
am right but now we we're doing this

794
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
am right but now we we're doing this
 

795
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,110
am right but now we we're doing this
uh using cash and at the beginning if

796
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
uh using cash and at the beginning if
 

797
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,669
uh using cash and at the beginning if
you

798
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
you
 

799
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,070
you
you need to pass this x and y which is

800
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
you need to pass this x and y which is
 

801
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,350
you need to pass this x and y which is
absolute value right

802
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
absolute value right
 

803
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,510
absolute value right
all right if this is a function what we

804
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
all right if this is a function what we
 

805
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,750
all right if this is a function what we
need to call is what

806
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
need to call is what
 

807
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,029
need to call is what
what what we need to call is f absolute

808
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
what what we need to call is f absolute
 

809
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,750
what what we need to call is f absolute
value

810
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
value
 

811
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,590
value
of x and absolute value of y right

812
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
of x and absolute value of y right
 

813
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,110
of x and absolute value of y right
yeah all right and

814
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
yeah all right and
 

815
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,270
yeah all right and
because of the value this could go to

816
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
because of the value this could go to
 

817
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,150
because of the value this could go to
the minimum

818
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
the minimum
 

819
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,549
the minimum
right all right so this needs to

820
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
right all right so this needs to
 

821
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,390
right all right so this needs to
absolute value as well

822
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
absolute value as well
 

823
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,950
absolute value as well
there's one string here it's abs you

824
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
there's one string here it's abs you
 

825
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,909
there's one string here it's abs you
need to put this abs value to all of it

826
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
need to put this abs value to all of it
 

827
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,789
need to put this abs value to all of it
why is that eric do you know why why why

828
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
why is that eric do you know why why why
 

829
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,909
why is that eric do you know why why why
we need to do this

830
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919

 

831
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,110

because like x minus one

832
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
because like x minus one
 

833
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,470
because like x minus one
y minus two x minus two minus minus

834
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
y minus two x minus two minus minus
 

835
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,710
y minus two x minus two minus minus
one mm-hmm it could be this bit

836
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720

 

837
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,830

so what i'm saying is the x the x minus

838
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
so what i'm saying is the x the x minus
 

839
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,150
so what i'm saying is the x the x minus
one y minus two x minus two y minus one

840
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
one y minus two x minus two y minus one
 

841
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,270
one y minus two x minus two y minus one
has to be

842
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
has to be
 

843
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,870
has to be
like the way yeah yeah

844
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
like the way yeah yeah
 

845
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,029
like the way yeah yeah
we need to put a absolute value of it

846
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
we need to put a absolute value of it
 

847
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,950
we need to put a absolute value of it
yeah yeah together whatever

848
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
yeah yeah together whatever
 

849
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,789
yeah yeah together whatever
absolute or minus three equals one three

850
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:44,799
absolute or minus three equals one three
 

851
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,990
absolute or minus three equals one three
yeah absolutely a hundred it was one

852
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
yeah absolutely a hundred it was one
 

853
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,580
yeah absolutely a hundred it was one
hundred yeah well absolute zero equals

854
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:52,590
hundred yeah well absolute zero equals
 

855
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:58,470
hundred yeah well absolute zero equals
[Music]

856
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480

 

857
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,830

yeah okay you're right computer you can

858
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:01,840
yeah okay you're right computer you can
 

859
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,549
yeah okay you're right computer you can
put minus

860
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:02,559
put minus
 

861
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:12,710
put minus
zero is actually let's say zero

862
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:12,720

 

863
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,830

can you tell everybody in the world what

864
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:15,840
can you tell everybody in the world what
 

865
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,590
can you tell everybody in the world what
have you learned so far

866
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
have you learned so far
 

867
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,270
have you learned so far
as short as possible okay we learned

868
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
as short as possible okay we learned
 

869
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,310
as short as possible okay we learned
about

870
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
about
 

871
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,669
about
the chest yes and we're gonna

872
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
the chest yes and we're gonna
 

873
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,590
the chest yes and we're gonna
play it in the kitchen yes yes boys

874
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
play it in the kitchen yes yes boys
 

875
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,789
play it in the kitchen yes yes boys
and we're gonna do the hats i'm

876
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
and we're gonna do the hats i'm
 

877
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,310
and we're gonna do the hats i'm
gonna leave the target yeah so what are

878
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
gonna leave the target yeah so what are
 

879
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,750
gonna leave the target yeah so what are
you trying to solve here

880
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,760
you trying to solve here
 

881
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,230
you trying to solve here
i'm i just want to know what have you

882

i'm i just want to know what have you
 

883
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,510
i'm i just want to know what have you
learned what's the

884
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
learned what's the
 

885
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,029
learned what's the
the menu of night moves yeah what's the

886
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039
the menu of night moves yeah what's the
 

887
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,590
the menu of night moves yeah what's the
the problem and how are we solving this

888
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
the problem and how are we solving this
 

889
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,350
the problem and how are we solving this
just answer these two questions

890
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
just answer these two questions
 

891
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,110
just answer these two questions
what's what's our problem what's the

892
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
what's what's our problem what's the
 

893
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,510
what's what's our problem what's the
problem here and how

894
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520

 

895
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,789

minimum moves yeah not the greatest

896
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
minimum moves yeah not the greatest
 

897
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,549
minimum moves yeah not the greatest
they're minimal yeah because great is

898
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559
they're minimal yeah because great is
 

899
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,390
they're minimal yeah because great is
there's no answer right you can always

900
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
there's no answer right you can always
 

901
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,909
there's no answer right you can always
find a bigger move right right

902
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:05,919
find a bigger move right right
 

903
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,870
find a bigger move right right
yeah you can always jump further right

904
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
yeah you can always jump further right
 

905
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,149
yeah you can always jump further right
i'm right there's no

906
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
i'm right there's no
 

907
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,310
i'm right there's no
such thing as the maximum number of

908
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320
such thing as the maximum number of
 

909
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,430
such thing as the maximum number of
moves but there's a

910
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
moves but there's a
 

911
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,710
moves but there's a
minimum move yeah yeah okay

912
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
minimum move yeah yeah okay
 

913
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,750
minimum move yeah yeah okay
okay and how are we solving this

914
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
okay and how are we solving this
 

915
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,270
okay and how are we solving this
uh dynamic programming yeah and

916
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,280
uh dynamic programming yeah and
 

917
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,390
uh dynamic programming yeah and
top down and how are we implementing it

918
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400

 

919
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,870

recursion with minimization remember the

920
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
recursion with minimization remember the
 

921
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,430
recursion with minimization remember the
cash

922
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
cash
 

923
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,710
cash
flow down okay okay okay that's it for

924
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
flow down okay okay okay that's it for
 

925
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,320
flow down okay okay okay that's it for
today good job
