00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,110
anything right
here that means there's no intersection

174
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
here that means there's no intersection
 

175
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,070
here that means there's no intersection
okay yeah

176
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
okay yeah
 

177
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,830
okay yeah
got it what's the complexity o n

178
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840

 

179
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,550

o a plus b let's say okay because a and

180
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
o a plus b let's say okay because a and
 

181
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,110
o a plus b let's say okay because a and
at least

182
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
at least
 

183
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,150
at least
the length of the a b that's a b okay

184
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
the length of the a b that's a b okay
 

185
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,469
the length of the a b that's a b okay
what's the space complexity i went

186
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479

 

187
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,430

look we are putting all the notes in a

188
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
look we are putting all the notes in a
 

189
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:01,830
look we are putting all the notes in a
to

190
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
to
 

191
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,469
to
in into the notebook right right if you

192
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
in into the notebook right right if you
 

193
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,189
in into the notebook right right if you
know which

194
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
know which
 

195
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,830
know which
which one is length bigger than you can

196
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
which one is length bigger than you can
 

197
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,909
which one is length bigger than you can
probably

198
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919

 

199
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,110

wait look if if a is

200
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
wait look if if a is
 

201
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,670
wait look if if a is
a hundred node and b is ten nodes you

202
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
a hundred node and b is ten nodes you
 

203
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,790
a hundred node and b is ten nodes you
want to optimize the space complexity so

204
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
want to optimize the space complexity so
 

205
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,830
want to optimize the space complexity so
so you can reverse this yeah you can you

206
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
so you can reverse this yeah you can you
 

207
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,390
so you can reverse this yeah you can you
can

208
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
can
 

209
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,510
can
you can put a notebook

210
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
you can put a notebook
 

211
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,670
you can put a notebook
put the notes in b to the notebook

212
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
put the notes in b to the notebook
 

213
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,670
put the notes in b to the notebook
instead of a so in this case that would

214
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
instead of a so in this case that would
 

215
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,230
instead of a so in this case that would
be ob

216
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
be ob
 

217
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,310
be ob
okay so i let you do it so you can do

218
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
okay so i let you do it so you can do
 

219
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,590
okay so i let you do it so you can do
this o mean

220
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
this o mean
 

221
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,520
this o mean
a b yeah you choose the meaning

222
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:37,530
a b yeah you choose the meaning
 

223
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,629
a b yeah you choose the meaning

[Music]
 

225
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,310
[Music]
do you get it right yes yes okay so now

226
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
do you get it right yes yes okay so now
 

227
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,350
do you get it right yes yes okay so now
can we do better can we do better yeah

228
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
can we do better can we do better yeah
 

229
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,430
can we do better can we do better yeah
can we do it without the notebook can we

230
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
can we do it without the notebook can we
 

231
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,870
can we do it without the notebook can we
do better can we do it

232
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
do better can we do it
 

233
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,590
do better can we do it
okay i give him look oh

234
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
okay i give him look oh
 

235
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,510
okay i give him look oh
okay and that this is the linked list

236
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
okay and that this is the linked list
 

237
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,670

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
okay so now this is a
 

243
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,029
okay so now this is a
this is b he needs more more

244
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
this is b he needs more more
 

245
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,110
this is b he needs more more
i like look so so how can we do this

246
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
i like look so so how can we do this
 

247
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,670
i like look so so how can we do this
i'll give you a hint okay look here yeah

248
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
i'll give you a hint okay look here yeah
 

249
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,830
i'll give you a hint okay look here yeah
walk walk walk

250
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
walk walk walk
 

251
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,469
walk walk walk
walk and then look this is getting the

252
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
walk and then look this is getting the
 

253
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,830
walk and then look this is getting the
end yeah

254
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
end yeah
 

255
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,189
end yeah
send that one no no no no no you will

256
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
send that one no no no no no you will
 

257
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,070
send that one no no no no no you will
move to this

258
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
move to this
 

259
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,749
move to this
this yeah okay walk

260
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
this yeah okay walk
 

261
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,909
this yeah okay walk
this is go to the end and then comes

262
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
this is go to the end and then comes
 

263
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,029
this is go to the end and then comes
here

264
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
here
 

265
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,550
here
yeah walk

266
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
yeah walk
 

267
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,830
yeah walk
and walk and then meet here why it is

268
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
and walk and then meet here why it is
 

269
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,870
and walk and then meet here why it is
working so basically when the a goes to

270
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
working so basically when the a goes to
 

271
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,430
working so basically when the a goes to
the end

272
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
the end
 

273
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,150
the end
and it needs to start with b when b goes

274
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
and it needs to start with b when b goes
 

275
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,510
and it needs to start with b when b goes
through the end then it starts with

276
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
through the end then it starts with
 

277
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,870
through the end then it starts with
a and they will eventually meet here

278
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
a and they will eventually meet here
 

279
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,990
a and they will eventually meet here
okay so let's say he didn't have destiny

280
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
okay so let's say he didn't have destiny
 

281
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,110
okay so let's say he didn't have destiny
then we just meet here look look there

282
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
then we just meet here look look there
 

283
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,390
then we just meet here look look there
what look look okay you

284
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
what look look okay you
 

285
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,749
what look look okay you
don't even have this it's still work

286
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
don't even have this it's still work
 

287
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,309
don't even have this it's still work
look you see okay

288
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
look you see okay
 

289
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,390
look you see okay
okay okay okay

290
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
okay okay okay
 

291
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,550
okay okay okay
okay and then here go back to okay

292
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
okay and then here go back to okay
 

293
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,469
okay and then here go back to okay
here okay okay here

294
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
here okay okay here
 

295
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,830
here okay okay here
here it still works okay

296
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
here it still works okay
 

297
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,990
here it still works okay
do you know why he's working okay okay

298
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
do you know why he's working okay okay
 

299
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,270
do you know why he's working okay okay
do you know why is working good question

300
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
do you know why is working good question
 

301
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,629
do you know why is working good question
look just think about it if if this this

302
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
look just think about it if if this this
 

303
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:34,950
look just think about it if if this this
bit

304
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
bit
 

305
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,950
bit
is air okay before the common part yeah

306
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
is air okay before the common part yeah
 

307
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,230
is air okay before the common part yeah
air node air a node let's say smaller a

308
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
air node air a node let's say smaller a
 

309
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,790
air node air a node let's say smaller a
nodes

310
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
nodes
 

311
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,670
nodes
here and smaller b notes here and then

312
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
here and smaller b notes here and then
 

313
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,390
here and smaller b notes here and then
there are c

314
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
there are c
 

315
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,430
there are c
notes they they after the common

316
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
notes they they after the common
 

317
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,909
notes they they after the common
intersection part they are signals yes

318
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
intersection part they are signals yes
 

319
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,510
intersection part they are signals yes
yeah so look in a

320
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
yeah so look in a
 

321
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,550
yeah so look in a
traverse a plus c okay

322
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
traverse a plus c okay
 

323
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,950
traverse a plus c okay
and then if we let it go here that will

324
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
and then if we let it go here that will
 

325
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,670
and then if we let it go here that will
plus b

326
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
plus b
 

327
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,110
plus b
go to this yes all right look

328
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
go to this yes all right look
 

329
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,390
go to this yes all right look
a trevor here a plus c right then i let

330
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
a trevor here a plus c right then i let
 

331
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,150
a trevor here a plus c right then i let
a star is here again

332
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
a star is here again
 

333
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,749
a star is here again
and then b notes here right okay

334
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
and then b notes here right okay
 

335
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,029
and then b notes here right okay
and then b plus c right

336
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
and then b plus c right
 

337
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,710
and then b plus c right
and then like let it start with a that

338
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
and then like let it start with a that
 

339
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,469
and then like let it start with a that
would be a no here so b

340
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
would be a no here so b
 

341
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,830
would be a no here so b
plus c plus a so do you see what's the

342
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840
plus c plus a so do you see what's the
 

343
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,710
plus c plus a so do you see what's the
problem

344
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
problem
 

345
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,909
problem
what what's the problem what what are

346
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:29,919
what what's the problem what what are
 

347
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,550
what what's the problem what what are
these

348
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
these
 

349
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,589
these
these are these two equal yeah

350
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
these are these two equal yeah
 

351
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,389
these are these two equal yeah
look they're like equal yeah yeah so

352
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
look they're like equal yeah yeah so
 

353
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,310
look they're like equal yeah yeah so
they are equal what does it mean

354
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
they are equal what does it mean
 

355
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,269
they are equal what does it mean
they will meet here yes yeah yeah do we

356
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
they will meet here yes yeah yeah do we
 

357
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,709
they will meet here yes yeah yeah do we
get it

358
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
get it
 

359
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,070
get it
is it interesting what's the term

360
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080
is it interesting what's the term
 

361
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,550
is it interesting what's the term
complexity

362
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560

 

363
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:58,790

o a plus b to be exact yes yes b

364
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800

 

365
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,910

oh maybe you are right a plus c o

366
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
oh maybe you are right a plus c o
 

367
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,750
oh maybe you are right a plus c o
a plus c plus b c b

368
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
a plus c plus b c b
 

369
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,590
a plus c plus b c b
actually is two c but we drop the

370
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
actually is two c but we drop the
 

371
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,949
actually is two c but we drop the
constant okay yeah

372
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
constant okay yeah
 

373
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,430
constant okay yeah
okay a plus b plus c is the number of

374
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
okay a plus b plus c is the number of
 

375
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,190
okay a plus b plus c is the number of
nodes okay

376
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
nodes okay
 

377
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,430
nodes okay
and then let's do this coding okay

378
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
and then let's do this coding okay
 

379
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,190
and then let's do this coding okay
define

380
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
define
 

381
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,829
define
okay get intersection okay and a

382
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
okay get intersection okay and a
 

383
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,550
okay get intersection okay and a
b you see then let's say

384
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
b you see then let's say
 

385
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,430
b you see then let's say
a head maybe i i do this uh

386
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440
a head maybe i i do this uh
 

387
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,030
a head maybe i i do this uh
look this is smaller a okay a b equals

388
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
look this is smaller a okay a b equals
 

389
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,150
look this is smaller a okay a b equals
a b c d

390
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
a b c d
 

391
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,070
a b c d
now they are at these two okay then y

392
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
now they are at these two okay then y
 

393
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,070
now they are at these two okay then y
a not equals b

394
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
a not equals b
 

395
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,590
a not equals b
right look a

396
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
right look a
 

397
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,949
right look a
equals a dot next

398
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
equals a dot next
 

399
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,150
equals a dot next
is a s b

400
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
is a s b
 

401
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,910
is a s b
look yes and then you tell me what to do

402
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
look yes and then you tell me what to do
 

403
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,990
look yes and then you tell me what to do
b equals b dot next look at this hey

404
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
b equals b dot next look at this hey
 

405
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,030
b equals b dot next look at this hey
if b if we still not reaching the end

406
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
if b if we still not reaching the end
 

407
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,030

as we make it to the star of a right
 

409
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,350
as we make it to the star of a right
and what should we return return a or b

410
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
and what should we return return a or b
 

411
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,310
and what should we return return a or b
here right

412
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
here right
 

413
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,269
here right
a or b because after this loop a and b

414
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
a or b because after this loop a and b
 

415
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,750
a or b because after this loop a and b
will be equal right

416
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
will be equal right
 

417
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,310
will be equal right
see it can you tell me yeah can you

418
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
see it can you tell me yeah can you
 

419

do you get it yeah any questions
 

449
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,590
do you get it yeah any questions
sure what which one is better okay

450
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
sure what which one is better okay
 

451
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,110
sure what which one is better okay
that's one question

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
which one is better this one
 

455
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,190
which one is better this one
this one is better because what's the

need any more because
 

473
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,910
need any more because
what the lens do do you see

474
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
what the lens do do you see
 

475
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,790
what the lens do do you see
the problem the previous one why is on

476
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
the problem the previous one why is on
 

477
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,509
the problem the previous one why is on
because we have a notebook yeah yeah and

478
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
because we have a notebook yeah yeah and
 

479
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:51,829
because we have a notebook yeah yeah and
if

480
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
if
 

481
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,590
if
that the link is a 100 million items

482
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
that the link is a 100 million items
 

483
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,350
that the link is a 100 million items
in the notebook you need a hundred

484
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
in the notebook you need a hundred
 

485
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,870
in the notebook you need a hundred
million space

486
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
million space
 

487
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,389
million space
right but this one if it a notebook it

488
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
right but this one if it a notebook it
 

489
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,230
right but this one if it a notebook it
has a hundred million notes it doesn't

490
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
has a hundred million notes it doesn't
 

491
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,670
has a hundred million notes it doesn't
matter i still

492

do you
 

503
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,829
do you
get it this is how we talk about the

504
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
get it this is how we talk about the
 

505
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,350
get it this is how we talk about the
complexity okay so don't make a guess

506
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
complexity okay so don't make a guess
 

507
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,910
complexity okay so don't make a guess
why is log log gain it doesn't make

508
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
why is log log gain it doesn't make
 

509
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,430
why is log log gain it doesn't make
sense here right you get it

510
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
sense here right you get it
 

511
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,629

00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
if it's not salty we just we need to go
 

711
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,389
if it's not salty we just we need to go
through each number so

712
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
through each number so
 

713
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,029
through each number so
once and why you always keep saying vlog

714
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
once and why you always keep saying vlog
 

715

you like logan and tell me when is it
 

733
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,190
you like logan and tell me when is it
the time complexity of logan

734
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
the time complexity of logan
 

735
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,270
the time complexity of logan
you know what's logan you're not look

736
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
you know what's logan you're not look
 

737
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,830
you know what's logan you're not look
not too based

738

not too based
 

739
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,350
not too based
the graph is like that yeah yeah log

740
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
the graph is like that yeah yeah log
 

741
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,630
the graph is like that yeah yeah log
i know two a equals one plug

yeah let's let's not too the only time
 

755
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,150
yeah let's let's not too the only time
having this

756
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
having this
 

757
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,990
having this
yeah carving having let's look

758
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
yeah carving having let's look
 

759
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,909
yeah carving having let's look
the first thing when you want to say

760
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
the first thing when you want to say
 

761
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,230
the first thing when you want to say
lock is

762
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
lock is
 

763
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,710
lock is
is halving okay so sorting algorithm

764
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
is halving okay so sorting algorithm
 

765
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,590
is halving okay so sorting algorithm
usually is

766
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
usually is
 

767
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,150
usually is
oh what sorting if i want to solve

768
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
oh what sorting if i want to solve
 

769
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,029
oh what sorting if i want to solve
something
