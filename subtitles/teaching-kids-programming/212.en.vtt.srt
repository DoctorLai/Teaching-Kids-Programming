me okay

4
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:15,679
me okay
 

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,710
me okay
what's factor if f i f

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
what's factor if f i f
 

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,429
what's factor if f i f
i is a factorial number okay so for

8
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
i is a factorial number okay so for
 

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,950
i is a factorial number okay so for
example one factorial equals

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
example one factorial equals
 

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,150
example one factorial equals
one factor exclamation mark one

12
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
one factor exclamation mark one
 

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,990
one factor exclamation mark one
two factorial three three four six

14
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
two factorial three three four six
 

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,870
two factorial three three four six
four factorial twenty-four five bacteria

16
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
four factorial twenty-four five bacteria
 

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,990
four factorial twenty-four five bacteria
one hundred and twenty

18
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000
one hundred and twenty
 

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,069
one hundred and twenty
okay so what are we doing here why why

20
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
okay so what are we doing here why why
 

21
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,670
okay so what are we doing here why why
is this we just

22
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
is this we just
 

23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,190
is this we just
times it one and then one time two then

24
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
times it one and then one time two then
 

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:50,630
times it one and then one time two then
one time two then three then one

26
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640

 

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,150

okay so f i equals i times

28
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
okay so f i equals i times
 

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,590
okay so f i equals i times
i minus one times what i minus two

30
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
i minus one times what i minus two
 

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,790
i minus one times what i minus two
and two another

32
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
and two another
 

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,149
and two another
one yeah and we can say f i equals

34
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
one yeah and we can say f i equals
 

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,910
one yeah and we can say f i equals
i times f y

36
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
i times f y
 

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,510
i times f y
remember in the first step we talk about

38
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
remember in the first step we talk about
 

39
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,469
remember in the first step we talk about
this equation f i equals i times one

40
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
this equation f i equals i times one
 

41
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,789
this equation f i equals i times one
f1 i subtract

42
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
f1 i subtract
 

43
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,149
f1 i subtract
one yeah so the f1 the

44
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
one yeah so the f1 the
 

45
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,310
one yeah so the f1 the
terminal condition is f1 equals one

46
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
terminal condition is f1 equals one
 

47
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,270
terminal condition is f1 equals one
right yeah

48
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
right yeah
 

49
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,870
right yeah
and f0 is also what the zero factorial

50
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
and f0 is also what the zero factorial
 

51
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,789
and f0 is also what the zero factorial
is also one okay this is a special case

52
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
is also one okay this is a special case
 

53
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,429
is also one okay this is a special case
yeah

54
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
yeah
 

55
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,390
yeah
yeah okay and zero factorial is one one

56
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
yeah okay and zero factorial is one one
 

57
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,429
yeah okay and zero factorial is one one
factor okay

58
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
factor okay
 

59
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,670
factor okay
look this is very important okay

60
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680

 

61
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,870

okay so now if i wanted to take

62
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
okay so now if i wanted to take
 

63
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,950
okay so now if i wanted to take
uh okay so i raised a little bit too

64
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
uh okay so i raised a little bit too
 

65
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,789
uh okay so i raised a little bit too
fast so look

66
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799
fast so look
 

67
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,830
fast so look
the first for you is 1 2

68
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
the first for you is 1 2
 

69
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,630
the first for you is 1 2
6 24 120

70
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:51,640
6 24 120
 

71
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,749
6 24 120
720 okay so

72
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
720 okay so
 

73
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,389
720 okay so
can you notice that if i have a

74
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
can you notice that if i have a
 

75
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,109
can you notice that if i have a
factorial

76
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
factorial
 

77
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,389
factorial
like 720 200 720 it's

78
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
like 720 200 720 it's
 

79
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,230
like 720 200 720 it's
always bigger than the previous

80
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
always bigger than the previous
 

81
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,910
always bigger than the previous
factorial sum right

82
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
factorial sum right
 

83
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,550
factorial sum right
right look it's always bigger than 100

84
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
right look it's always bigger than 100
 

85
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,630
right look it's always bigger than 100
20 plus 24 plus six percent

86
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
20 plus 24 plus six percent
 

87
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,030
20 plus 24 plus six percent
and 24 is always bigger than the

88
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
and 24 is always bigger than the
 

89
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,070
and 24 is always bigger than the
previous number

90
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
previous number
 

91
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,390
previous number
120 is always bigger than the previous

120 is always bigger than the previous
factorial sum all right

94
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
factorial sum all right
 

95
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,990
factorial sum all right
two is bigger than previous time six is

96
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
two is bigger than previous time six is
 

97
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,229
two is bigger than previous time six is
bigger than one plus two am right

98
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
bigger than one plus two am right
 

99
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,150
bigger than one plus two am right
yeah okay okay why why is that look

100
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
yeah okay okay why why is that look
 

101
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,150
yeah okay okay why why is that look
we can prove this okay we can prove this

102
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
we can prove this okay we can prove this
 

103
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,430
we can prove this okay we can prove this
f i f

f i f
 

105
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,710
f i f
i plus one equals

106
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
i plus one equals
 

107
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,990
i plus one equals
i plus 1 times f

108
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
i plus 1 times f
 

109
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,110
i plus 1 times f
i right yeah we already know that right

110
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
i right yeah we already know that right
 

111
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,670
i right yeah we already know that right
yeah and this is b bigger than

112
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
yeah and this is b bigger than
 

113
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,670
yeah and this is b bigger than
i times f i right yeah

114
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
i times f i right yeah
 

115
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,750
i times f i right yeah
look f i is a positive number

116
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
look f i is a positive number
 

117
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,830
look f i is a positive number
times i plus one times it's always

118
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
times i plus one times it's always
 

119
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,470
times i plus one times it's always
bigger than times i times i'm right

120
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
bigger than times i times i'm right
 

121
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,309
bigger than times i times i'm right
yeah okay this one okay so i

122
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
yeah okay this one okay so i
 

123
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,830
yeah okay this one okay so i
comes fi what does it mean is equals to

124
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
comes fi what does it mean is equals to
 

125
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,509
comes fi what does it mean is equals to
they are how many times of f i

126
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
they are how many times of f i
 

127
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,550
they are how many times of f i
uh how many i times f i

128
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
uh how many i times f i
 

129
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,270
uh how many i times f i
how many times are f i i yeah so that

130
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
how many times are f i i yeah so that
 

131
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,670
how many times are f i i yeah so that
will be

132
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
will be
 

133
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,110
will be
f i plus f i plus

134
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
f i plus f i plus
 

135
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,550
f i plus f i plus
f i plus f so there are

136
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
f i plus f so there are
 

137
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,390
f i plus f so there are
i terms of this i comes this right

138
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
i terms of this i comes this right
 

139
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,070
i terms of this i comes this right
yeah item solids

140
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
yeah item solids
 

141
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,229
yeah item solids
okay so this look if i write it another

142
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
okay so this look if i write it another
 

143
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,270
okay so this look if i write it another
way look the sum

144
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
way look the sum
 

145
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,710
way look the sum
of the first first i minus one

146
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
of the first first i minus one
 

147
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,309
of the first first i minus one
um okay so the sum okay so let's say

148
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
um okay so the sum okay so let's say
 

149
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,509
um okay so the sum okay so let's say
here we have this f i

150
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
here we have this f i
 

151
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,030
here we have this f i
plus f i minus 1 right

152
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
plus f i minus 1 right
 

153
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,789
plus f i minus 1 right
look at plus f i minus 2 plus

154
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
look at plus f i minus 2 plus
 

155
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,509
look at plus f i minus 2 plus
2i so listing this thing equals what

156
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
2i so listing this thing equals what
 

157
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,869
2i so listing this thing equals what
this is the sum of the first i items

158
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
this is the sum of the first i items
 

159
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,589
this is the sum of the first i items
right

160
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
right
 

161
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,270
right
all right so what we can use this yeah

162
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
all right so what we can use this yeah
 

163
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,390
all right so what we can use this yeah
this is the sum sum f

164
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
this is the sum sum f
 

165
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,229
this is the sum sum f
j j equals y side

166
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
j j equals y side
 

167
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,110
j j equals y side
yeah yeah area so this symbol is j

168
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
yeah yeah area so this symbol is j
 

169
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,590
yeah yeah area so this symbol is j
equals 1 to i

170
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
equals 1 to i
 

171
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,550
equals 1 to i
okay so you can play you can think of it

172
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
okay so you can play you can think of it
 

173
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,430
okay so you can play you can think of it
as a 4

174
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
as a 4
 

175
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,469
as a 4
4 j equals 1

176
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
4 j equals 1
 

177
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,230
4 j equals 1
to i inclusion and i will i want to sum

178
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
to i inclusion and i will i want to sum
 

179
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,950
to i inclusion and i will i want to sum
f j

180
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
f j
 

181
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,710
f j
so it's equal to f i f i minus 1

182
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
so it's equal to f i f i minus 1
 

183
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,909
so it's equal to f i f i minus 1
plus f minus 2 right

184
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
plus f minus 2 right
 

185
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,510
plus f minus 2 right
yeah so that

186
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
yeah so that
 

187
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,510
yeah so that
i times of what actually this is f

188
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
i times of what actually this is f
 

189
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,150
i times of what actually this is f
i okay yeah

190
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160

 

191
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,670

this is f5 fj was like sum of fi so

192
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
this is f5 fj was like sum of fi so
 

193
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,350
this is f5 fj was like sum of fi so
which one is bigger

194
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
which one is bigger
 

195
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,350
which one is bigger
these and this which one is bigger which

196
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
these and this which one is bigger which
 

197
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,710
these and this which one is bigger which
one which one is bigger

198
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
one which one is bigger
 

199
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,749
one which one is bigger
these are these which one is bigger

200
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
these are these which one is bigger
 

201
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,029
these are these which one is bigger
yeah these items and this one yeah of

202
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
yeah these items and this one yeah of
 

203
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:03,830
yeah these items and this one yeah of
course look

204
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
course look
 

205
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,749
course look
this is equal but this is bigger than

206
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
this is equal but this is bigger than
 

207
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,430
this is equal but this is bigger than
that this is bigger than that so it's

208
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
that this is bigger than that so it's
 

209
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,710
that this is bigger than that so it's
bigger

210
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
bigger
 

211
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,670
bigger
and so what does it mean so f i plus 1

212
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
and so what does it mean so f i plus 1
 

213
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,590
and so what does it mean so f i plus 1
is always bigger

214
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
is always bigger
 

215
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,469
is always bigger
this is bigger than the sum of its

216
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
this is bigger than the sum of its
 

217
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,110
this is bigger than the sum of its
previous

218
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
previous
 

219
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,029
previous
right we just prove it yeah cut it

220
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039

 

221
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,670

of the factorial number but each number

258
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
of the factorial number but each number
 

259
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,469
of the factorial number but each number
you can only use one that's what i mean

260
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
you can only use one that's what i mean
 

261
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,270
you can only use one that's what i mean
this thing

262
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
this thing
 

263
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,870
this thing
and most one 24 6 one

264
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
and most one 24 6 one
 

265
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,909
and most one 24 6 one
wow okay oh yeah so yeah you can

in this case you can tell me yes okay
how about four

270
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
how about four
 

271
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,110
how about four
nine why is that you can't use two twice

272
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
nine why is that you can't use two twice
 

273
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,710
nine why is that you can't use two twice
or use one four times well done so

274
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
or use one four times well done so
 

275
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,390
or use one four times well done so
at least it's not yeah because two we

can we do it from the smallest can we
 

309
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,530
can we do it from the smallest can we
just take it from the smallest

number bigger factor

332
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
number bigger factor
 

333
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,070
number bigger factor
right that's what it means yeah so we

334
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
right that's what it means yeah so we
 

335
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,270
right that's what it means yeah so we
always take the

336
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
always take the
 

337
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,589
always take the
biggest one because if we can take this

338
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
biggest one because if we can take this
 

339
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,309
biggest one because if we can take this
one

340
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
one
 

341
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,070
one
it means that we can we cannot

342
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
it means that we can we cannot
 

343
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,390
it means that we can we cannot
if we take this one means unique because

344
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
if we take this one means unique because
 

345
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,110
if we take this one means unique because
the

346
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
the
 

347
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,189
the
this sum is bigger this is bigger than

348
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
this sum is bigger this is bigger than
 

349
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,869
this sum is bigger this is bigger than
the previous yeah

350
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
the previous yeah
 

351
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,350
the previous yeah
okay yeah got it so that works yeah

352
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
okay yeah got it so that works yeah
 

353
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,670
okay yeah got it so that works yeah
because i take 24 i know

354
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
because i take 24 i know
 

355
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,390
because i take 24 i know
the previous numbers cannot sum up to 24

356
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
the previous numbers cannot sum up to 24
 

357
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,869
the previous numbers cannot sum up to 24
yeah

358
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
yeah
 

359
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,029
yeah
all right but if you take this morning

360
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
all right but if you take this morning
 

361
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:25,990
all right but if you take this morning
this number

362
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
this number
 

363
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,309
this number
like this you reach the chance of using

364
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
like this you reach the chance of using
 

365
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,430
like this you reach the chance of using
the 24 right

366
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
the 24 right
 

367
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,950
the 24 right
because you already use the smaller

368
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:30,960
because you already use the smaller
 

369
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,029
because you already use the smaller
numbers am i right okay

370
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
numbers am i right okay
 

371
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,630
numbers am i right okay
okay

372
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640

 

373
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,469

we can also use the default search right

374
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
we can also use the default search right
 

375
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,670
we can also use the default search right
because look

376
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
because look
 

377
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,630
because look
this is a a kind of nasa problem and

378
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
this is a a kind of nasa problem and
 

379
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,470
this is a a kind of nasa problem and
that's it what's next

380
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
that's it what's next
 

381
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,470
that's it what's next
now yeah nap stack

382
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
now yeah nap stack
 

383
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,470
now yeah nap stack
is a type of like sack that you snap in

384
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
is a type of like sack that you snap in
 

385
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,949
is a type of like sack that you snap in
neptune

386
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959

 

387
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,269

okay so these are the options candidates

388
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
okay so these are the options candidates
 

389
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,230
okay so these are the options candidates
the numbers

390
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
the numbers
 

391
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,150
the numbers
i know we can each one we can choose

392
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
i know we can each one we can choose
 

393
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,389
i know we can each one we can choose
pick or not pick right

394
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
pick or not pick right
 

395
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,070
pick or not pick right
yeah if we pick it we go to the next one

396
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
yeah if we pick it we go to the next one
 

397
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,910
yeah if we pick it we go to the next one
we've saw this problem before yeah

398
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
we've saw this problem before yeah
 

399
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,470
we've saw this problem before yeah
so we want to example we want to take

400
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
so we want to example we want to take
 

401
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,990
so we want to example we want to take
each item

402
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
each item
 

403
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,829
each item
at most one so we can for each item we

404
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
at most one so we can for each item we
 

405
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,590
at most one so we can for each item we
can choose pick or not pick

406
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
can choose pick or not pick
 

407
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,829
can choose pick or not pick
pick pick and not until we get a

408
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
pick pick and not until we get a
 

409
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,070
pick pick and not until we get a
uh 31 okay this is one approach we can

410
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
uh 31 okay this is one approach we can
 

411
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,590
uh 31 okay this is one approach we can
talk about this tomorrow okay but today

412
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
talk about this tomorrow okay but today
 

413
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,350
talk about this tomorrow okay but today
we're going to implement this one

414
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
we're going to implement this one
 

415
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,949
we're going to implement this one
yeah and this one okay yeah

416
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
yeah and this one okay yeah
 

417
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,990
yeah and this one okay yeah
so in order to do this what do we need

418
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
so in order to do this what do we need
 

419
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,870
so in order to do this what do we need
to do

420
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
to do
 

421
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,509
to do
at the beginning in in order to do this

422
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
at the beginning in in order to do this
 

423
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,670
at the beginning in in order to do this
again what do we need to do

424
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
again what do we need to do
 

425
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,110
again what do we need to do
we do what do we need to do what are we

426
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
we do what do we need to do what are we
 

427
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,829
we do what do we need to do what are we
doing here

428
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
doing here
 

429
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,910
doing here
we need to do what what do we need to do

430
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
we need to do what what do we need to do
 

431
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,949
we need to do what what do we need to do
here

432
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
here
 

433
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,110
here
we need to uh stay the ones which are

434
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
we need to uh stay the ones which are
 

435
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,070
we need to uh stay the ones which are
smaller

436
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
smaller
 

437
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,269
smaller
but yeah what's smaller

438
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
but yeah what's smaller
 

439
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,990
but yeah what's smaller
than we can subtract okay so but in

440
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
than we can subtract okay so but in
 

441
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,430
than we can subtract okay so but in
order to do that

442
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
order to do that
 

443
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,829
order to do that
at the very beginning what do we need to

444
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
at the very beginning what do we need to
 

445
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,670
at the very beginning what do we need to
do we need to

446
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
do we need to
 

447
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,630
do we need to
calculate the saturn right right and

448
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
calculate the saturn right right and
 

449
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,310
calculate the saturn right right and
obviously we need to put it in at least

450
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
obviously we need to put it in at least
 

451
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,829
obviously we need to put it in at least
there and we can try from the

452
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
there and we can try from the
 

453
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,310
there and we can try from the
largest if we if we don't calculate it

454
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
largest if we if we don't calculate it
 

455
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,269
largest if we if we don't calculate it
it'll be hard right

456
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
it'll be hard right
 

457
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,030
it'll be hard right
we need to know these numbers but that

458
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
we need to know these numbers but that
 

459
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,110
we need to know these numbers but that
will be easier

460
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
will be easier
 

461
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,590
will be easier
let's do this

462
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600

 

463
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,430

let's say define a sum

464
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
let's say define a sum
 

465
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:44,790
let's say define a sum
of factorial okay fact okay

466
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800

 

467
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,190

at the beginning what what is the eagle

468
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
at the beginning what what is the eagle
 

469
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,710
at the beginning what what is the eagle
at the beginning

470
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
at the beginning
 

471
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,829
at the beginning
the numbers is this the right

472
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
the numbers is this the right
 

473
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,350
the numbers is this the right
i mean list list bracket yeah at least

474
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
i mean list list bracket yeah at least
 

475
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,430
i mean list list bracket yeah at least
okay at the beginning third at the

476
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
okay at the beginning third at the
 

477
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,310
okay at the beginning third at the
beginning is the first one is one

478
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
beginning is the first one is one
 

479
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,990
beginning is the first one is one
and and

480
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
and and
 

481
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,190
and and
okay and then we want to multiply by x x

482
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
okay and then we want to multiply by x x
 

483
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,069
okay and then we want to multiply by x x
equals one okay so y

484
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
equals one okay so y
 

485
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:22,790
equals one okay so y
fact is smaller or equal n

486
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800

 

487
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,150

times times equals x and now what should

488
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
times times equals x and now what should
 

489
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,990
times times equals x and now what should
we do with the fact

490
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
we do with the fact
 

491
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,509
we do with the fact
what should we do with the fact uh

492
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
what should we do with the fact uh
 

493
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,949
what should we do with the fact uh
we put it in the list yeah yeah

494
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
we put it in the list yeah yeah
 

495
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,829
we put it in the list yeah yeah
so what can you tell me what's like uh

496
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
so what can you tell me what's like uh
 

497
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,630
so what can you tell me what's like uh

okay and what's next we have final fact

502
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
okay and what's next we have final fact
 

503
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,430
okay and what's next we have final fact
and what what's next

504
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
and what what's next
 

505
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,710
and what what's next
what happened to x x equals x plus one x

506
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
what happened to x x equals x plus one x
 

507
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,990
what happened to x x equals x plus one x
plus one okay

508
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
plus one okay
 

509
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,430
plus one okay
let's equal one yeah x equals 1

510
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
let's equal one yeah x equals 1
 

511
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,230
let's equal one yeah x equals 1
3 times 1 is 1 and we put 1 in the list

512
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
3 times 1 is 1 and we put 1 in the list
 

513
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,069
3 times 1 is 1 and we put 1 in the list
and then x equals 2

514
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
and then x equals 2
 

515
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,190
and then x equals 2
and we times f x equals

516
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
and we times f x equals
 

517
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,230
and we times f x equals
2 right put the 2 in the list and 2

518
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
2 right put the 2 in the list and 2
 

519
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,870
2 right put the 2 in the list and 2
times x

520
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
times x
 

521
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,590
times x
plus equals one is three two times three

522
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
plus equals one is three two times three
 

523
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,350
plus equals one is three two times three
yeah you got it i don't put it in the

524
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
yeah you got it i don't put it in the
 

525
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,190
yeah you got it i don't put it in the
list alarms

526
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200
list alarms
 

527
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,509
list alarms
okay now i want to start from the

element is what -1
 

545
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,389
element is what -1
yeah but what are we trying to do here

546
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
yeah but what are we trying to do here
 

547
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,230
yeah but what are we trying to do here
the numbers the numbers here

548
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
the numbers the numbers here
 

549
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,350
the numbers the numbers here
the numbers is 1 2

550
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
the numbers is 1 2
 

551
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,829
the numbers is 1 2
6 24 120. yeah look

552
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
6 24 120. yeah look
 

553
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,230
6 24 120. yeah look
that's numbs nums always will be here

554
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
that's numbs nums always will be here
 

555
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,990
that's numbs nums always will be here
will be this one and what what are we

556
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
will be this one and what what are we
 

557
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,430
will be this one and what what are we
trying to do here

558
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,440
trying to do here
 

559
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,230
trying to do here
what should we try first we shall try

560
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
what should we try first we shall try
 

561
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,030
what should we try first we shall try
the biggest

562
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
the biggest
 

563
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,150
the biggest
120 so what what's the index of these

564
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
120 so what what's the index of these
 

565
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,750
120 so what what's the index of these
what's the index of these minus one

566
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
what's the index of these minus one
 

567
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,230
what's the index of these minus one
what number why what minus one length

568
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
what number why what minus one length
 

569
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,509
what number why what minus one length
length function num

570
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
length function num
 

571
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,670
length function num
minus one and then at the end we want to

572
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
minus one and then at the end we want to
 

573
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,550
minus one and then at the end we want to
go here right

574
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560
go here right
 

575
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,110
go here right
right we want to reach here yeah but we

576
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
right we want to reach here yeah but we
 

577
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,069
right we want to reach here yeah but we
need to give the

578
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
need to give the
 

579
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,470
need to give the
one position to the left what's what's

580
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
one position to the left what's what's
 

581
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,150
one position to the left what's what's
the end minus one

582
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
the end minus one
 

583
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,829
the end minus one
i know what's the step if you go to the

584
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839
i know what's the step if you go to the
 

585
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,509
i know what's the step if you go to the
left what's this one

586
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
left what's this one
 

587
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,629
left what's this one
yeah one column

588
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
yeah one column
 

589
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,750
yeah one column
okay okay if n is

590
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
okay okay if n is
 

591
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,190
okay okay if n is
bigger or equal

592
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200

 

593
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,990

what should we do if this number 120 is

594
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
what should we do if this number 120 is
 

595
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,670
what should we do if this number 120 is
bigger than 120

596
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
bigger than 120
 

597
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,069
bigger than 120
what should we do what should we do what

598
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:48,079
what should we do what should we do what
 

599
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,269
what should we do what should we do what
should we do

600
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
should we do
 

601
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,790
should we do
if we look if look before it is 144

602
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
if we look if look before it is 144
 

603
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,350
if we look if look before it is 144
right

604
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
right
 

605
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,670
right
if it now is 120 what should we do with

606
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
if it now is 120 what should we do with
 

607
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,350
if it now is 120 what should we do with
that like this number

608
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
that like this number
 

609
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,629
that like this number
n minus m

610
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
n minus m
 

611
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,910
n minus m
minus equals nums i

612
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
minus equals nums i
 

613
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,550
minus equals nums i
i okay that's it and then and then at

614
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
i okay that's it and then and then at
 

615
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,150
i okay that's it and then and then at
the end if you come to if it goes

616
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
the end if you come to if it goes
 

617
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,829
the end if you come to if it goes
through these

618
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
through these
 

619
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,990
through these
already and what should we check if the

620
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
already and what should we check if the
 

621
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,430
already and what should we check if the
number is one

622
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
number is one
 

623
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,629
number is one
if n equals yeah okay

624
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
if n equals yeah okay
 

625
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,189
if n equals yeah okay
okay okay what's the time complexity

626
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
okay okay what's the time complexity
 

627
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,269
okay okay what's the time complexity
it's very tricky this one

628
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
it's very tricky this one
 

629
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,750
it's very tricky this one
what's the time conversion what's the

630
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
what's the time conversion what's the
 

631
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,790
what's the time conversion what's the
time complex

632

these numbers
 

649
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,189
these numbers
factories the number of factorial that

650
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
factories the number of factorial that
 

651
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,189
factories the number of factorial that
are small or bigger than n

652
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
are small or bigger than n
 

653
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,829
are small or bigger than n
yeah small bigger than n smaller yeah

okay so m
 

657
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,710
okay so m
is the number of factorial that are

658
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
is the number of factorial that are
 

659
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,870
is the number of factorial that are
smaller that is smaller than

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
smaller that is smaller than
 

661
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,470
smaller that is smaller than
n right right yeah if it's in this range

662
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
n right right yeah if it's in this range
 

663
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,629
n right right yeah if it's in this range
like 2 to the power of 31 right

664
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
like 2 to the power of 31 right
 

665
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,389
like 2 to the power of 31 right
if this 32 bit integer if it's a sun

666
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
if this 32 bit integer if it's a sun
 

667
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,590
if this 32 bit integer if it's a sun
it's the up to these minus one yeah so

668
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600
it's the up to these minus one yeah so
 

669
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,150
it's the up to these minus one yeah so
it's

670
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
it's
 

671
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,269
it's
it's almost 12 12 actually

672
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
it's almost 12 12 actually
 

673
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,310
it's almost 12 12 actually
distinct bacteria yeah we are excluding

674
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
distinct bacteria yeah we are excluding
 

675
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,990
distinct bacteria yeah we are excluding
the zero factor

676
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
the zero factor
 

677
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,710
the zero factor
there are 12 distinct factors that are

678
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
there are 12 distinct factors that are
 

679
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,990
there are 12 distinct factors that are
smaller

680
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
smaller
 

681
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,949
smaller
than this number yeah okay so if it is

682
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
than this number yeah okay so if it is
 

683
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:45,910
than this number yeah okay so if it is
the case

684
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
the case
 

685
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,629
the case
we know it's the number is fixed that

686
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639
we know it's the number is fixed that
 

687
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,030
we know it's the number is fixed that
the time and space complexity is what

688
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040

 

689
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,550

one come on

690
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560

 

691
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,710

one or one yeah because i just told you

692
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
one or one yeah because i just told you
 

693
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,470
one or one yeah because i just told you
if that there only 12.

694
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
if that there only 12.
 

695
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,990
if that there only 12.
so here at most 12 iteration and here

696
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
so here at most 12 iteration and here
 

697
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,470
so here at most 12 iteration and here
almost 12 12 iteration okay that's a one

698
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
almost 12 12 iteration okay that's a one
 

699
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,749
almost 12 12 iteration okay that's a one
in both space and complex times space

700
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
in both space and complex times space
 

701
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,509
in both space and complex times space
complexity but if i tell you n

702
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:13,519
complexity but if i tell you n
 

703
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,670
complexity but if i tell you n
is absolutely large number then you need

704
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
is absolutely large number then you need
 

705
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,949
is absolutely large number then you need
to tell me o

706
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
to tell me o
 

707
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,990
to tell me o
m where m is the number of the bacterias

708
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
m where m is the number of the bacterias
 

709
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,110
m where m is the number of the bacterias
that is smaller yeah

710
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
that is smaller yeah
 

711
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,230
that is smaller yeah
that is smaller than n okay all right

712
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240
that is smaller than n okay all right
 

713
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,069
that is smaller than n okay all right
that's it for today oh that's it for

714
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
that's it for today oh that's it for
 

715
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,150
that's it for today oh that's it for
today you can say bye bye

716
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
today you can say bye bye
 

717
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,240
today you can say bye bye
goodbye bye bye bye
