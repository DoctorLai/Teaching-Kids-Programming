00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360

 

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,509

so today we will talk about how to add a

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
so today we will talk about how to add a
 

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,870
so today we will talk about how to add a
two-linked list

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
two-linked list
 

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,310
two-linked list
so for example like you mean exchange

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
so for example like you mean exchange
 

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,070
so for example like you mean exchange
no edit for example that sounds a bit

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
no edit for example that sounds a bit
 

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,870
no edit for example that sounds a bit
easy okay so tell me 46 plus

12
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:25,880
easy okay so tell me 46 plus
 

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,870
easy okay so tell me 46 plus
74 equals

14
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
74 equals
 

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:37,590
74 equals
120.

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600

 

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,190

[Music]

18
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200

 

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,670

okay so one way of doing one way of

20
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
okay so one way of doing one way of
 

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,549
okay so one way of doing one way of
doing this is

22
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
doing this is
 

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,670
doing this is
start from the least least significant

24
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
start from the least least significant
 

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,389
start from the least least significant
digit yeah so so it's the right most you

26
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
digit yeah so so it's the right most you
 

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,029
digit yeah so so it's the right most you
start with

28
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
start with
 

29
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,750
start with
six plus four is ten right you carry

30
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
six plus four is ten right you carry
 

31
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,270
six plus four is ten right you carry
over one here yeah

32
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
over one here yeah
 

33
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,950
over one here yeah
so 1 plus 4 plus 7 equals 12

34
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
so 1 plus 4 plus 7 equals 12
 

35
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,070
so 1 plus 4 plus 7 equals 12
you put a 2 here carry over one so 1. do

36
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
you put a 2 here carry over one so 1. do
 

37
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,869
you put a 2 here carry over one so 1. do
you get it

38
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
you get it
 

39
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,310
you get it
yeah okay so now

40
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
yeah okay so now
 

41
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,990
yeah okay so now
this is easy to understand how it works

42
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
this is easy to understand how it works
 

43
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,070
this is easy to understand how it works
okay so how about i tell you that

44
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
okay so how about i tell you that
 

45
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,270
okay so how about i tell you that
this number 46 is a linked list

46
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
this number 46 is a linked list
 

47
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,190
this number 46 is a linked list
represented by this six link to four

48
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,200
represented by this six link to four
 

49
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,230
represented by this six link to four
and then 74 in reverse okay so the least

50
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
and then 74 in reverse okay so the least
 

51
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,749
and then 74 in reverse okay so the least
significant bit

52
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
significant bit
 

53
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,429
significant bit
digit is confirmed yeah this is the most

54
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
digit is confirmed yeah this is the most
 

55
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,310
digit is confirmed yeah this is the most
significant

56
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
significant
 

57
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,230
significant
uh digit this is the least significant

58
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
uh digit this is the least significant
 

59
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,429
uh digit this is the least significant
pieces the left most

60
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
pieces the left most
 

61
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,910
pieces the left most
are the most significant the right modes

62
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
are the most significant the right modes
 

63
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,230
are the most significant the right modes
are least significant right because the

64
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
are least significant right because the
 

65
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,190
are least significant right because the
left mouse are bigger carry more weight

66
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
left mouse are bigger carry more weight
 

67
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,590
left mouse are bigger carry more weight
right

68
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
right
 

69
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,469
right
70 70 7 is 17 four means just four right

70
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
70 70 7 is 17 four means just four right
 

71
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,310
70 70 7 is 17 four means just four right
okay so these you're given two head

72
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
okay so these you're given two head
 

73
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,749
okay so these you're given two head
linked please this is

linked please this is
 

75
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,870
linked please this is
equal forty seven yeah a and b and what

76
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
equal forty seven yeah a and b and what
 

77
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,830

some random
 

93
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,190
some random
uh brainstorming how are you dealing

94
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
uh brainstorming how are you dealing
 

95
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,350
uh brainstorming how are you dealing
with it

96
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
with it
 

97
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,949
with it
you don't want me to worry about coding

98
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
you don't want me to worry about coding
 

99
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,390
you don't want me to worry about coding
just tell me what's your source of

100
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
just tell me what's your source of
 

101
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,550
just tell me what's your source of
solving this problem

102
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
solving this problem
 

103
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,990
solving this problem
yeah ryan any thoughts

104
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
yeah ryan any thoughts
 

105
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,630
yeah ryan any thoughts
no wait wait wait wait all you need to

106
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
no wait wait wait wait all you need to
 

107
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,830
no wait wait wait wait all you need to
do

108
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840

 

109
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,390

is the

110
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
is the
 

111
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,229
is the
answer then write it backwards

112
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
answer then write it backwards
 

113
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,509
answer then write it backwards
find the answer and write it backwards

114
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
find the answer and write it backwards
 

115
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,670
find the answer and write it backwards
okay that's one one solution

116
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
okay that's one one solution
 

117
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,710
okay that's one one solution
so one solution is that we

118
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
so one solution is that we
 

119
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,550
so one solution is that we
we come up with the method to convert

120
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
we come up with the method to convert
 

121
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,990
we come up with the method to convert
these liquids

122
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
these liquids
 

123
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,190
these liquids
into a number right so we convert this

124
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
into a number right so we convert this
 

125
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,509
into a number right so we convert this
into 46 and we convert this into

126
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
into 46 and we convert this into
 

127
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,710
into 46 and we convert this into
74 and then we know in python we just

128
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
74 and then we know in python we just
 

129
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,990
74 and then we know in python we just
add it together and then it will be all

130
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
add it together and then it will be all
 

131
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,869
add it together and then it will be all
120.

132
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
120.
 

133
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,949
120.
then we find another message to convert

134
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
then we find another message to convert
 

135
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,030
then we find another message to convert
120 back to this right

136
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
120 back to this right
 

137
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,550
120 back to this right
to link this yeah yeah all right yeah

138
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
to link this yeah yeah all right yeah
 

139
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,550
to link this yeah yeah all right yeah
that will work i mean

140
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
that will work i mean
 

141
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,190
that will work i mean
it has some overheads of converting it

142
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
it has some overheads of converting it
 

143
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,030
it has some overheads of converting it
converting from linked list to the

144
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
converting from linked list to the
 

145
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,270
converting from linked list to the
number and backwards converting the

146
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
number and backwards converting the
 

147
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,750
number and backwards converting the
numbers back to the english level what

148
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
numbers back to the english level what
 

149
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,589
numbers back to the english level what
random network

150
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
random network
 

151
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,030
random network
so look when we deal with the

152
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
so look when we deal with the
 

153
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,509
so look when we deal with the
addition we added these numbers one by

154
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
addition we added these numbers one by
 

155
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,509
addition we added these numbers one by
one right the from the right to the left

156
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
one right the from the right to the left
 

157
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,390
one right the from the right to the left
right

158
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
right
 

159
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,430
right
then we how about we are now at least

160
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
then we how about we are now at least
 

161
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,309
then we how about we are now at least
at the beginning of the two linked list

162
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
at the beginning of the two linked list
 

163
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,110
at the beginning of the two linked list
why don't we just add them together

164
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
why don't we just add them together
 

165
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,270
why don't we just add them together
now we know it's 10 we carry over one

166
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
now we know it's 10 we carry over one
 

167
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,750
now we know it's 10 we carry over one
yeah it's like you're adding numbers

168

now it's good we are here right we're
here at the point into the

208
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
here at the point into the
 

209
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,469
here at the point into the
least significant digit do you get it

210
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
least significant digit do you get it
 

211
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,469
least significant digit do you get it
yeah yeah okay so can we

212
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
yeah yeah okay so can we
 

213
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,629

define add
let's call it as yellow and l1 okay

220
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
let's call it as yellow and l1 okay
 

221
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,990
let's call it as yellow and l1 okay
link list yeah yeah yeah

222
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
link list yeah yeah yeah
 

223
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,590
link list yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah okay so

224
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
yeah yeah yeah okay so
 

225
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,030
yeah yeah yeah okay so
yeah we're done so uh

226
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
yeah we're done so uh
 

227
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,350
yeah we're done so uh
that's diff let's create a link link a

228
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
that's diff let's create a link link a
 

229
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,870
that's diff let's create a link link a
thumbnail head yeah this is

230
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
thumbnail head yeah this is
 

231
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,270
thumbnail head yeah this is
yeah dummy means that uh we are not

232
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
yeah dummy means that uh we are not
 

233
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,110
yeah dummy means that uh we are not
actually using this dummy head to

234
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
actually using this dummy head to
 

235
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,189
actually using this dummy head to
represent any value we're just using it

236
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
represent any value we're just using it
 

237
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:05,670
represent any value we're just using it
as a

238
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
as a
 

239
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,029
as a
placeholder it's next value will be the

240
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
placeholder it's next value will be the
 

241
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,990
placeholder it's next value will be the
bigger result okay so like dummy

242
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
bigger result okay so like dummy
 

243
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,749
bigger result okay so like dummy
equals this node

244
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
equals this node
 

245
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,749
equals this node
uh node minus one that's just two minus

246
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
uh node minus one that's just two minus
 

247
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,510
uh node minus one that's just two minus
and then head equals dummy also

248
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
and then head equals dummy also
 

249
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,189
and then head equals dummy also
i'll show you why we need this dummy

250
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
i'll show you why we need this dummy
 

251
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,710
i'll show you why we need this dummy
here okay and carry let's

252
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
here okay and carry let's
 

253
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,070
here okay and carry let's
do a carry carry is carry over will be

254
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
do a carry carry is carry over will be
 

255
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,510
do a carry carry is carry over will be
equals to what carry equal to

256
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
equals to what carry equal to
 

257
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,110
equals to what carry equal to
one at the beginning carry is zero right

258
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
one at the beginning carry is zero right
 

259
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,870
one at the beginning carry is zero right
no no no zero because you don't have

260
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
no no no zero because you don't have
 

261
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,390
no no no zero because you don't have
carry at the moment okay

262
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
carry at the moment okay
 

263
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,469
carry at the moment okay
so now this is interesting b y

264
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
so now this is interesting b y
 

265
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,310
so now this is interesting b y
l zero while we still have the s yellow

266
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
l zero while we still have the s yellow
 

267
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,390
l zero while we still have the s yellow
o l l1 oh carry right

268

like
what should i put here seven plus four

374
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
what should i put here seven plus four
 

375
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,710
what should i put here seven plus four
eleven i just needed the left

376
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:26,720
eleven i just needed the left
 

377
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,990
eleven i just needed the left
right most digit right yeah so how do we

378
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
right most digit right yeah so how do we
 

379
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,749
right most digit right yeah so how do we
get it let's know the current current

380
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
get it let's know the current current
 

381
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,990
get it let's know the current current
digit right

382
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
digit right
 

383
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,509
digit right
current digit what

384
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
current digit what
 

385
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,149
current digit what
remember the modulus divided by 10

386
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
remember the modulus divided by 10
 

387
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,269
remember the modulus divided by 10
remains

388
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
remains
 

389
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,269
remains
remain yeah all right

390
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
remain yeah all right
 

391
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,350
remain yeah all right
remain what we mean

392
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
remain what we mean
 

393
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,389
remain what we mean
one remain 10 do more than

394
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
one remain 10 do more than
 

395
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,990
one remain 10 do more than
10 okay okay now we're linking this list

396
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
10 okay okay now we're linking this list
 

397
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,150
10 okay okay now we're linking this list
we're linking this value and then

398
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160

 

399
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,150

what head equals head

400
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
what head equals head
 

401
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,790
what head equals head
dot next right moving this to the next

402
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
dot next right moving this to the next
 

403
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,350
dot next right moving this to the next
one

404
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
one
 

405
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,870
one
look if we a1 if l0 if

406
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
look if we a1 if l0 if
 

407
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,990
look if we a1 if l0 if
if this value this link list okay like 3

408
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
if this value this link list okay like 3
 

409
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,990
if this value this link list okay like 3
4 43 okay if if we still have this value

410
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
4 43 okay if if we still have this value
 

411
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,070
4 43 okay if if we still have this value
we need to add this value and move it to

412
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
we need to add this value and move it to
 

413
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,030
we need to add this value and move it to
the next so here

414
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
the next so here
 

415
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,389
the next so here
missing l what is zero equals s zero

416
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
missing l what is zero equals s zero
 

417
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,829
missing l what is zero equals s zero
next right and here again a one equals

418
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
next right and here again a one equals
 

419
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,030
next right and here again a one equals
a one dot next right yeah and then when

420
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
a one dot next right yeah and then when
 

421
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,150
a one dot next right yeah and then when
this is

422
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
this is
 

423
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,790
this is
again when there's a carry over then you

424
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
again when there's a carry over then you
 

425
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,389
again when there's a carry over then you
keep doing until and then

426
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
keep doing until and then
 

427
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,710
keep doing until and then
this current did carry over carry over

428
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
this current did carry over carry over
 

429
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,829
this current did carry over carry over
equals one

430
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839

 

431
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,269

look 11 is current digit

432
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
look 11 is current digit
 

433
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,550
look 11 is current digit
and i'm adding one here to here

434
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
and i'm adding one here to here
 

435
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,070
and i'm adding one here to here
and then i need to add this one

436
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
and then i need to add this one
 

437
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,190
and then i need to add this one
to the make this one as a carry over so

438
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
to the make this one as a carry over so
 

439
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,230
to the make this one as a carry over so
carry over equals current digit

440
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240

 

441
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,310

divided by 10 right yes all right

442
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
divided by 10 right yes all right
 

443
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,110
divided by 10 right yes all right
yes and then at the end of return return

444
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
yes and then at the end of return return
 

445
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,389
yes and then at the end of return return
what

446
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
what
 

447
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,269
what
we say guess can we call it no no no no

448
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
we say guess can we call it no no no no
 

449
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,550
we say guess can we call it no no no no
no a header will be equal remember

450
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
no a header will be equal remember
 

451
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,269
no a header will be equal remember
no head yeah dummy

452
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
no head yeah dummy
 

453
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,630
no head yeah dummy
but remember we're talking about the

454
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
but remember we're talking about the
 

455
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,990
but remember we're talking about the
tummy tuck yes

456
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000

 

457
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,269

next we're done yeah yeah

458
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
next we're done yeah yeah
 

459
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,590
next we're done yeah yeah
you're listening yeah tell me done next

you're listening yeah tell me done next
look tell me

462
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
look tell me
 

463
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,389
look tell me
now you see why we're using the dummy

464
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
now you see why we're using the dummy
 

465
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,389
now you see why we're using the dummy
right yeah dummy is the

466
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
right yeah dummy is the
 

467
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,710
right yeah dummy is the
placeholder it doesn't hold the value

468
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
placeholder it doesn't hold the value
 

469
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,910
placeholder it doesn't hold the value
but it's next

470
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
but it's next
 

471
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,190
but it's next
pointer it's pointing net pointing to

472
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
pointer it's pointing net pointing to
 

473
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,470
pointer it's pointing net pointing to
the answer

474
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
the answer
 

475
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,949
the answer
that's why we tell me you can put any

476
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
that's why we tell me you can put any
 

477
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,990
that's why we tell me you can put any
value here yeah

478
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
value here yeah
 

479
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,790
value here yeah
any value any value i don't care because

480
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
any value any value i don't care because
 

481
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,710
any value any value i don't care because
i'm written in term in the next

482
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
i'm written in term in the next
 

483
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,949
i'm written in term in the next
and then i had equal stomach why is that

484
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
and then i had equal stomach why is that
 

485
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,030
and then i had equal stomach why is that
because every time i create a new note

486
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
because every time i create a new note
 

487
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,190
because every time i create a new note
look dummy i i created you know what i

488
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
look dummy i i created you know what i
 

489
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,350
look dummy i i created you know what i
do i create a new note and put a

490
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
do i create a new note and put a
 

491
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,030
do i create a new note and put a
head would be dummy i had the next

492
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
head would be dummy i had the next
 

493
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,030
head would be dummy i had the next
equals this create a new now

494
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040

something it's the same yeah because you

530
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
something it's the same yeah because you
 

531
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,910
something it's the same yeah because you
need to create a space for that right

532
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
need to create a space for that right
 

533
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,150
need to create a space for that right
a type it'll be o o

534
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
a type it'll be o o
 

535
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,030
a type it'll be o o
yeah it's just o n you know i went yeah

536
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
yeah it's just o n you know i went yeah
 

537
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,150
yeah it's just o n you know i went yeah
for no reason

538
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
for no reason
 

539
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,949
for no reason
yeah because look you add in two numbers

540
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
yeah because look you add in two numbers
 

541
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,949
yeah because look you add in two numbers
and then

542
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
and then
 

543
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,829
and then
normally you will be you you'll be

544
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
normally you will be you you'll be
 

545
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,949
normally you will be you you'll be
actually o

546
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
actually o
 

547
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,389
actually o
max and m right

548
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
max and m right
 

549
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,910
max and m right
you get it because you're adding two

550
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
you get it because you're adding two
 

551
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,590
you get it because you're adding two
numbers and the length will be

552
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
numbers and the length will be
 

553
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,990
numbers and the length will be
maximum of the the maximum of those

554
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
maximum of the the maximum of those
 

555
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,550
maximum of the the maximum of those
two right yeah i'm right

556
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:25,560
two right yeah i'm right
 

557
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,910
two right yeah i'm right
9099 999 plus one

558
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
9099 999 plus one
 

559
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,150
9099 999 plus one
there'll be a ten thousand thousand yeah

560
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
there'll be a ten thousand thousand yeah
 

561
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,949
there'll be a ten thousand thousand yeah
look

562
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
look
 

563
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,870
look
nine nine nine nine four digit and then

564
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
nine nine nine nine four digit and then
 

565
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,150
nine nine nine nine four digit and then
you one digit and the result will be

566
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
you one digit and the result will be
 

567
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,710
you one digit and the result will be
four plus one digit yeah yeah the longer

568
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
four plus one digit yeah yeah the longer
 

569
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,389
four plus one digit yeah yeah the longer
one yeah so that's what it comes from

570
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
one yeah so that's what it comes from
 

571
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,829
one yeah so that's what it comes from
okay

572
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
okay
 

573
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,230
okay

i
so what why is this why is this why do

592
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
so what why is this why is this why do
 

593
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,030
so what why is this why is this why do
we need a carry here

594
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
we need a carry here
 

595
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,269
we need a carry here
why or carry can you tell we need to

596
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
why or carry can you tell we need to
 

597
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,389
why or carry can you tell we need to
carry this yeah

598
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
carry this yeah
 

599
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,509
carry this yeah
yeah if you have like 794 is over

600
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
yeah if you have like 794 is over
 

601
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,350
yeah if you have like 794 is over
10 yeah sometimes when you finish

602
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
10 yeah sometimes when you finish
 

603
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,110
10 yeah sometimes when you finish
adding the numbers and you still have

604
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
adding the numbers and you still have
 

605
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,389
adding the numbers and you still have
one carry like

606
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
one carry like
 

607
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,430
one carry like
99 plus one yeah you add in the numbers

608
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
99 plus one yeah you add in the numbers
 

609
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,590
99 plus one yeah you add in the numbers
yeah but you still when you add it

610
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
yeah but you still when you add it
 

611
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,030
yeah but you still when you add it
that's zero zero right

612
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
that's zero zero right
 

613
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,870
that's zero zero right
you still have one carry if you don't

614
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
you still have one carry if you don't
 

615
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,710
you still have one carry if you don't
add this carry the answer would be zero

616
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
add this carry the answer would be zero
 

617
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,629
add this carry the answer would be zero
zero which is not right right

618
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
zero which is not right right
 

619
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,550
zero which is not right right
do you get it so that's why you need to

620
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
do you get it so that's why you need to
 

621
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,750
do you get it so that's why you need to
have this carry

622
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
have this carry
 

623
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,269
have this carry
and then you need to finish when this

624
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
and then you need to finish when this
 

625
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,110
and then you need to finish when this
carry is zero as well so you put one

626
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
carry is zero as well so you put one
 

627
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,750
carry is zero as well so you put one
here

628
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
here
 

629
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,150
here
got it that's what it means and then if

630
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
got it that's what it means and then if
 

631
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,230
got it that's what it means and then if
if our error zero if

632
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
if our error zero if
 

633
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,550
if our error zero if
it means that we we are adding the

634
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
it means that we we are adding the
 

635
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,990
it means that we we are adding the
values of the notes if

636
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
values of the notes if
 

637
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,629
values of the notes if
that we still can have this linked list

638
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
that we still can have this linked list
 

639
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,110
that we still can have this linked list
note

640
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
note
 

641
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,509
note
right and move it to the next move it to

642
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
right and move it to the next move it to
 

643
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,949
right and move it to the next move it to
the next

644
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
the next
 

645
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,870
the next
okay this means divided by 10

646
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
okay this means divided by 10
 

647
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,150
okay this means divided by 10
like 123 divided by 10 is

648
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
like 123 divided by 10 is
 

649
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,350
like 123 divided by 10 is
12 right yeah

650
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
12 right yeah
 

651
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,790
12 right yeah
this means that okay so 17 19 17

652
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
this means that okay so 17 19 17
 

653
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,310
this means that okay so 17 19 17
a divided by 10 equals one uh

654
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
a divided by 10 equals one uh
 

655
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,590
a divided by 10 equals one uh
seven point eight no this two means

656
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
seven point eight no this two means
 

657
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,710
seven point eight no this two means
just integer power is seven okay yeah

658
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
just integer power is seven okay yeah
 

659
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,509
just integer power is seven okay yeah
just seven that's what it means and then

660
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
just seven that's what it means and then
 

661
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,189
just seven that's what it means and then
seventy eight

662
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
seventy eight
 

663
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,389
seventy eight
modulus ten equals one

664
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399

 

665
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,030

seven eight divided by ten

666
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
seven eight divided by ten
 

667
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,949
seven eight divided by ten
is seventeen seventy eight is minus

668
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
is seventeen seventy eight is minus
 

669
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,310
is seventeen seventy eight is minus
seventy is eight right

670
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
seventy is eight right
 

671
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,550
seventy is eight right
so basically these modular ten is the

672
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
so basically these modular ten is the
 

673
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,750
so basically these modular ten is the
these eight them

674
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
these eight them
 

675
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,949
these eight them
the the right digit the lemons digit why

676
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
the the right digit the lemons digit why
 

677
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,269
the the right digit the lemons digit why
eight i wanted eight and then i multiply

678
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
eight i wanted eight and then i multiply
 

679
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,670
eight i wanted eight and then i multiply
ten if i only seven i divided by ten

680
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
ten if i only seven i divided by ten
 

681
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,389
ten if i only seven i divided by ten
you see how we get the numbers yeah yeah

682
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
you see how we get the numbers yeah yeah
 

683
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,710
you see how we get the numbers yeah yeah
this is how we get the numbers okay

684
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
this is how we get the numbers okay
 

685
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:03,750
this is how we get the numbers okay
okay any questions

686
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760

 

687
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,990

okay i'm gonna see you tomorrow okay bye
