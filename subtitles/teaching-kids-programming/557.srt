1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:12,480
okay so what's uh Sudoku

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:15,900
it's like a 9x9 square and it's filled

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,900
with numbers not all of them but and

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,560
there's nine squares with nine squares

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,480
inside and nine columns each okay like

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,240
that all right so each one is nine times

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,779
nine right and then what are the rules

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,779
for that

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,140
so you try to fill the numbers with one

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,480
to nine right and also the rows and

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,760
columns did one to nine okay and they

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,340
all have to eat and they all have to

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,960
equal

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:57,559
one day one day and then also one there

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,559
right yeah yeah so like I I

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,600
and they will have to equal up I see I

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,600
see yeah

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,760
tonight well um well I'm not sure it's

19
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,920
after number actually so yeah to sum up

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,920
yeah we put the numbers one to nine

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,060
we put the numbers one to nine in each

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,460
box little box there are nine of them

23
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,100
and the numbers

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,240
each number can only appear once in each

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:34,280
row each column and obviously in its own

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,380
sale okay when we talk about this

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,780
we talk about you know how to complete

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,340
how to solve it with some numbers in

29
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,259
that but some numbers we need to

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,579
determine right so we use the

31
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,799
backtracking

32
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,560
so how do we backtracking I show you

33
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,220
it's very easy yeah basically that's a

34
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,619
search so if this number is missing then

35
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,380
we try to determine right and then we

36
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,200
can try you know we can try one two

37
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,380
three four up to nine and if it violates

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,899
the existing rule we just try the next

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,000
one if it doesn't violence for example

40
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,140
if I can put a 4 here right so I move to

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,319
the next one

42
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,720
I move the next empty cell and I keep

43
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,879
trying step as such backtracking the

44
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,099
idea is very simple definitely go deep

45
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:23,640
as deeper as you can right so if we can

46
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:26,160
put a number four then we move to the

47
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,560
next one if we can put the number four

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,200
here we try number five if we running

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,660
out of Digit up to nine then we go back

50
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,640
to the previous solution previous uh

51
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,459
empty cell for example the previous one

52
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,040
is uh three and then we increment this

53
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,920
to five this is the backtracking to

54
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,959
solve this problem okay so today

55
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,040
expression similar like yesterday we

56
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:53,540
designed the maze so the question is we

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,900
want to design that again like design

58
00:02:53,540 --> 00:03:01,440
it doesn't have to be so when you say

59
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,440
designers Sudoku so we want to return a

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,819
fully solved

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,640
that's a very good question so I just

62
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,980
said design uh Sudoku and that's it you

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,080
need to ask a lot of questions before we

64
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,959
actually go into the details okay so

65
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,540
these are questions to clarify the

66
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,300
requirement okay so you're saying does

67
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,540
it have to be fully solvable right do

68
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:28,260
you have to return a solved certificate

69
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,060
no your playlist game right all numbers

70
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,940
are filled in we don't play right it's

71
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,599
already layer so the question is that

72
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:39,060
design uh Sudoku that returns partially

73
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,159
right so it can be played we can play on

74
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,159
it right and that's a very good question

75
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,900
so is uh partially right it has to be

76
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,480
partially filled

77
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,940
all parts of the completed the second

78
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,060
one is any more questions

79
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,959
any more questions we can ask any more

80
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,879
questions when you play this Dooku

81
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,159
it's solvable that's a good question

82
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,260
yeah obviously it has to be solvable if

83
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,540
it's not solvable the worst case I can

84
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,159
just put random numbers in there and you

85
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,340
can find the solution right for example

86
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,739
I return a Sudoku and with two ones here

87
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,299
no matter what the rest it's not

88
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,299
solvable because one and one is eight

89
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:21,620
right okay so it has to be solvable and

90
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,620
any more questions

91
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,720
it had to have nine by nine squares

92
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,940
obviously Sudoku is nine by nine okay so

93
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,600
when you play the game you can choose

94
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,600
something to play you can set the level

95
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,139
of who is that when you play the game

96
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,160
usually you can set the level of what

97
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:47,720
level of what

98
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:50,880
easy yeah yeah yeah what is it called

99
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,639
yeah difficulty right the level of

100
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,360
difficulties yeah all right that could

101
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:00,180
be one of that level of difficulty

102
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,460
and another one is

103
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,820
how many solutions

104
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,919
okay because some Sudoku could have many

105
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,500
solutions right if you're saying okay

106
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,020
there's only one unique Solutions yeah

107
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,759
okay maybe one unique solution right so

108
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,960
there's only one way right

109
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:22,259
obviously if you are given uh empty

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,680
empty stuku there are how many

111
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:28,139
these two numbers huh

112
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,259
6.679 times 10 to the power of 21 so 10

113
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:34,560
this number followed by

114
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:38,220
21-0 this is a huge number so this is

115
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,639
the number of total Sudoku Valley States

116
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,280
right but if we do move the duplications

117
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,340
duplication like you know some states

118
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,639
may be the same if you transform uh if

119
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:53,280
you rotate it nearly right and it brings

120
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,539
down the number to 5.4 times 10 to the

121
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,340
power of 9 very solvable States okay

122
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:02,460
yeah make sense

123
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,160
okay so we're saying that if we return

124
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,979
an empty cell and then obviously this is

125
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,539
not unique okay okay so these are not

126
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,419
requirements all right we want to return

127
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,400
a partially field State and it has to be

128
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,560
solvable if it's not soluble there's no

129
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,539
point right and then the level of

130
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,060
difficulty this is optional we need to

131
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,699
consider the number of different usually

132
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,520
okay so how do you know if it's easy

133
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,280
easy to do how do you know it's hard

134
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,039
by looking at our numbers

135
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,900
the the number how I mean how do we know

136
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,759
it's an easy how do we know it's a

137
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,100
difficult

138
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,620
by giving you two how do you tell which

139
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,620
one is easy to solve one of these is

140
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,539
let's try yes because the more numbers

141
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:51,060
more clues right so it's easy to solve

142
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:54,120
last number you have to try right all

143
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,440
right yeah then it's a more difficult to

144
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,020
solve that's exactly what I thought

145
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,479
about the numbers the number of numbers

146
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:05,120
yes yes I understand good job numbers

147
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,120
okay okay so how can we design that

148
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:19,199
I think we have to get a Sudoku

149
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,419
um and and fill all of it and then and

150
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,300
then delete a load of them very good

151
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,919
very good so first of all we need to

152
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:31,160
find

153
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:34,440
a complete complete it Sudoku right

154
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,699
and then remove numbers and then we move

155
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,880
the numbers

156
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:42,180
remove a teacher at one right step two

157
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,099
I remove a digit and that will return a

158
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,139
valid solvable state right these two

159
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:49,280
steps satisfy this one and this one how

160
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,280
about level of difficulties

161
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,940
yeah okay so we can simply remove a

162
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,160
certain amount yeah yeah so we can

163
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,080
simply repeat the step two to make it

164
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,759
this one but how about this one how many

165
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,380
solutions if we want to make sure it's

166
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,180
only one

167
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,180
how do we make sure if it's only one

168
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,280
um that's that's basically the first

169
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,960
time we are finding a complete let's

170
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,940
start right complete and then he has

171
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,860
stupid random right yeah we don't want

172
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,139
to we want we don't want to return the

173
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,699
same uh every time it has to be rendered

174
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,520
okay we come back to the step one later

175
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,699
remove a digit right and then we need to

176
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,039
check if it is solvable right and

177
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,560
obviously it's solvable and

178
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,260
check if it's over and only one solution

179
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,300
right if it is solvable and if we have

180
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,860
removed a number certain number of

181
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,020
digits right this could be a parameter

182
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,720
like if we want to remove n digit so for

183
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,720
example if we remove the one digit one

184
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,580
if we removed one to ten digits then we

185
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,940
say it's easy okay

186
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,920
if we do more 10 to 20 digit 11 to 20

187
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,779
this will say medium okay for example if

188
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,540
we know 21 to

189
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,399
upwards it will be hard okay okay this

190
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,440
is just example of configuration of the

191
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,779
game if we remove the up to 10 digit

192
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,480
it's easy okay remove one digit at the

193
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:12,360
time if we go back to check if the

194
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,040
Sudoku can be solved and contains only

195
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,440
one solution right we can use the

196
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,580
backtracking right to count how many

197
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,220
solutions

198
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,860
if we already remove ntg then that's it

199
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,459
right if it not okay what happened if we

200
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,740
leave digit we do it move these two many

201
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:30,540
solutions then we have to pull a digit

202
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,980
back right because if we remove the

203
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,060
digit for example if we do more or less

204
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,740
9

205
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,839
and then we found out there are two

206
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,540
solutions right then we have to put the

207
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,880
number nine back right make sense okay

208
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,300
so the first one find the completed

209
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,279
random Sudoku how do we find we can just

210
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,519
simply do the backtracking all right but

211
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,800
with some random randomness so we try

212
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,440
for example we can try instead of trying

213
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,300
from one to nine we can randomly select

214
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,420
the number we can Shuffle the selections

215
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,820
right the next number we could Shuffle

216
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,640
so for example the next one is empty

217
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,920
self right empty set then we can

218
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,680
randomly pick an integer from one to

219
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,600
nine instead of trying from one two

220
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,080
three up to nine right previously when

221
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,360
we do the backtracking to find

222
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,580
a solution we always try from one right

223
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,940
so but we want to return some Randomness

224
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,760
then we can choose the random integer

225
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,000
layer and once we complete uh find a

226
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:33,300
Sudoku State we remove a digit and we we

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,279
check if these Sudoku is solvable and

228
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,860
only one solution right only one

229
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,940
solution and if it is we keep removing

230
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,440
until n digit right make sense

231
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,480
yes

232
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,480
okay so what have you learned today

233
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:56,160
so to make a Sudoku yeah okay

234
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,160
I mean obviously

235
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,260
The Brute Force way is I just randomly

236
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,480
generate number I put the numbers there

237
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,700
and I randomly take it out and I check

238
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,959
if it is

239
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,660
solvable but that's going to take more

240
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,120
time right yeah because when you run

241
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,640
then you put the numbers in you cannot

242
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,140
guarantee that

243
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,560
this one yeah yeah that's what I meant

244
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:22,380
right because

245
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,700
yeah I know I know this way is a it's a

246
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,640
very very inefficient it's not

247
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,399
practically uh useful right when you

248
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,380
randomly generate the numbers so when

249
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,660
you run the Nintendo numbers it could be

250
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,240
anything and it could already be

251
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,220
unsolvable and no matter what numbers

252
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,320
you've taken out it's still unsolvable

253
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,680
and you have to check you can do this

254
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,260
repeat you generate a random blending uh

255
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,180
sudo check if it's a solver if it's

256
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,920
solver then break otherwise to repeat

257
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,079
but this is not very good okay that's

258
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,480
what I said one better way here is that

259
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,440
we use the backtracking algorithm to to

260
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,300
find uh come completed Sudoku with some

261
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,459
random yeah we want to we want this uh

262
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,920
stucco to be random and after that we

263
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:07,500
remove a digit at the time all right we

264
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,540
can remove any random digit at the time

265
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,480
and if after we're doing the moving

266
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,760
around that digit if it has more than

267
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,920
one solution we put it back we put the

268
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,380
digit back we'll try the next one right

269
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,899
if it's uh only one

270
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,959
solution now we can keep removing it

271
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:27,120
until ended it and this is n digit this

272
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,079
is the level of difficulty okay does it

273
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,000
make sense

274
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,000
okay that's it for the day bye-bye
