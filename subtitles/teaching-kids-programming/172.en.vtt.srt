1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,669

okay so today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
okay so today we're going to talk about
 

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,390
okay so today we're going to talk about
come on come on so we talked about how

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,400
come on come on so we talked about how
 

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,030
come on come on so we talked about how
the accuracy to check if the binary is

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040
the accuracy to check if the binary is
 

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,750
the accuracy to check if the binary is
the sun binary so what's combination

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:17,760
the sun binary so what's combination
 

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,029
the sun binary so what's combination
of the tree so if

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
of the tree so if
 

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,830
of the tree so if
any note except the leaves which doesn't

12
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
any note except the leaves which doesn't
 

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,950
any note except the leaves which doesn't
have any kids

14
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
have any kids
 

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,630
have any kids
if it's equal to

16
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640

 

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,429

so if equals to to the kids right for

18
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:31,439
so if equals to to the kids right for
 

19
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,389
so if equals to to the kids right for
example they three

20
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
example they three
 

21
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,709
example they three
equals one plus two and two equals two

22
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
equals one plus two and two equals two
 

23
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,110
equals one plus two and two equals two
right except the leaf now that it's a

24
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
right except the leaf now that it's a
 

25
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,869
right except the leaf now that it's a
fine yeah yeah all two kids yeah if

26
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
fine yeah yeah all two kids yeah if
 

27
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,990
fine yeah yeah all two kids yeah if
then if at least if all the notes

28
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
then if at least if all the notes
 

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,270
then if at least if all the notes
except for this note equals to the

30
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
except for this note equals to the
 

31
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,910
except for this note equals to the
sum of its kids then it's a some binary

32
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
sum of its kids then it's a some binary
 

33
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,709
sum of its kids then it's a some binary
tree okay

34
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
tree okay
 

35
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,430
tree okay
so remind me how many ways can we travel

36
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
so remind me how many ways can we travel
 

37
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:53,750
so remind me how many ways can we travel
a

38
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
a
 

39
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,189
a
binary oh breakfast deficit okay so we

40
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
binary oh breakfast deficit okay so we
 

41
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,110
binary oh breakfast deficit okay so we
talk about preferences today okay but

42
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
talk about preferences today okay but
 

43
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,549
talk about preferences today okay but
what's breakfast search can you remind

44
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
what's breakfast search can you remind
 

45
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,150
what's breakfast search can you remind
me okay

46
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
me okay
 

47
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,270
me okay
three one two two zero okay so level

48
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
three one two two zero okay so level
 

49
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,030
three one two two zero okay so level
five level and what's the definition you

50
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
five level and what's the definition you
 

51
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,710
five level and what's the definition you
used to put on

52
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
used to put on
 

53
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,990
used to put on
one two two zero three one two two zero

54
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
one two two zero three one two two zero
 

55
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,910
one two two zero three one two two zero
yeah but it's different meaning yeah

56
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
yeah but it's different meaning yeah
 

57
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,350
yeah but it's different meaning yeah
level by level if i put

58
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
level by level if i put
 

59
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,109
level by level if i put
another uh nine the first search is

60
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
another uh nine the first search is
 

61
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,670
another uh nine the first search is
three

62
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
three
 

63
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,310
three
that would be some yeah yeah i know but

64
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
that would be some yeah yeah i know but
 

65
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,149
that would be some yeah yeah i know but
so in this case it will be four there it

66
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
so in this case it will be four there it
 

67
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,350
so in this case it will be four there it
will be three one two

68
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
will be three one two
 

69
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,429
will be three one two
nine two zero but the difference search

70
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
nine two zero but the difference search
 

71
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,789
nine two zero but the difference search
the pre-order will be

72
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
the pre-order will be
 

73
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,469
the pre-order will be
three one nine two two zero okay

74
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:32,479
three one nine two two zero okay
 

75
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,950
three one nine two two zero okay
it didn't have this one will it be the

76
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
it didn't have this one will it be the
 

77
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,670
it didn't have this one will it be the
same

78
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
same
 

79
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,590
same
you'll be the same you'll be let's say

80
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
you'll be the same you'll be let's say
 

81
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,749
you'll be the same you'll be let's say
okay so let's talk about first search

82
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
okay so let's talk about first search
 

83
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,069
okay so let's talk about first search
okay

84
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
okay
 

85
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,830
okay
in python what kind of data structure

86
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
in python what kind of data structure
 

87
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,350
in python what kind of data structure
are we used to to

88
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
are we used to to
 

89
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,870
are we used to to
implement the preference search

90
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880

 

91
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,910

in python what what kill dk what's

92
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
in python what what kill dk what's
 

93
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,910
in python what what kill dk what's
speaking

94
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
speaking
 

95
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,190
speaking
that means that like uh you

96
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
that means that like uh you
 

97
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,109
that means that like uh you
you push you i get get

98
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
you push you i get get
 

99
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,149
you push you i get get
like you have one two uh

100
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
like you have one two uh
 

101
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,510
like you have one two uh
anyway and you you you get this one and

102
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:05,520
anyway and you you you get this one and
 

103
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,190
anyway and you you you get this one and
give a new one

104
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
give a new one
 

105
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,150
give a new one
so double ending means that you can you

106
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
so double ending means that you can you
 

107
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,790
so double ending means that you can you
push it

108
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
push it
 

109
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,070
push it
and then you can when you pop

110
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
and then you can when you pop
 

111
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,949
and then you can when you pop
it you can use the pop left on this one

112
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
it you can use the pop left on this one
 

113
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,589
it you can use the pop left on this one
right

114
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
right
 

115
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,309
right
you push to the end you will push a pen

116
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
you push to the end you will push a pen
 

117
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,030
you push to the end you will push a pen
yeah

118
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
yeah
 

119
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,750
yeah
yeah so basically but you apparent uh it

120
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
yeah so basically but you apparent uh it
 

121
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,110
yeah so basically but you apparent uh it
has

122
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
has
 

123
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,949
has
you can because it's double ended so you

124
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
you can because it's double ended so you
 

125
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,630
you can because it's double ended so you
basically can push and pop from both

126
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
basically can push and pop from both
 

127
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,270
basically can push and pop from both
sides

128
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
sides
 

129
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,710
sides
pop left and then you can pop and a pen

130
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
pop left and then you can pop and a pen
 

131
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,790
pop left and then you can pop and a pen
or you can append that right so it's a

132
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
or you can append that right so it's a
 

133
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,309
or you can append that right so it's a
double nd kill right

134
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
double nd kill right
 

135
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,150
double nd kill right
but in uh in breakfast you only

136
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,160
but in uh in breakfast you only
 

137
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,509
but in uh in breakfast you only
a pop left and a pen a pen which is a

138
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
a pop left and a pen a pen which is a
 

139
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,150
a pop left and a pen a pen which is a
pen right

140
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
pen right
 

141
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,949
pen right
right yeah but it doesn't have right

142
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
right yeah but it doesn't have right
 

143
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,470
right yeah but it doesn't have right
yeah you only have a pen and

144
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
yeah you only have a pen and
 

145
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,670
yeah you only have a pen and
a pen left it has pop and

146
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
a pen left it has pop and
 

147
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,670
a pen left it has pop and
pop left right doesn't make sense

148
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
pop left right doesn't make sense
 

149
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,470
pop left right doesn't make sense
okay define define

150
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480

 

151
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,750

is so defined finally

152
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
is so defined finally

what's the point read read bracket

156
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
what's the point read read bracket
 

157
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:42,630
what's the point read read bracket
column okay if not rude

158
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640

 

159
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,670

bigger than zero yeah this is and you

160
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
bigger than zero yeah this is and you
 

161
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,030
bigger than zero yeah this is and you
also need to use

162
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
also need to use
 

163
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,630
also need to use
oh yeah yeah and current equals q over

164
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
oh yeah yeah and current equals q over
 

165
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,229
oh yeah yeah and current equals q over
pop left left okay

166
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
pop left left okay
 

167
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,869
pop left left okay
okay let's put the let's assume s is the
