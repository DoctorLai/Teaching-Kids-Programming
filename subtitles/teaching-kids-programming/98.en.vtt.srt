00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,549

so

6
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
so
 

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,549
so
today we are going to talk about

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
today we are going to talk about
 

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,750
today we are going to talk about
the concept of concept of dynamic

10
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:17,760
the concept of concept of dynamic
 

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,470
the concept of concept of dynamic
programming

12
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:18,480
programming
 

13
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,429
programming
i already know dynamics are you sure

14
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
i already know dynamics are you sure
 

15
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:21,750
i already know dynamics are you sure
yeah

16
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
yeah
 

17
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,750
yeah
it's one piano from instruments

18
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
it's one piano from instruments
 

19
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,950
it's one piano from instruments
it's about how loud

20
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960

 

21
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,590

dynamic programming so what's dynamic

22
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
dynamic programming so what's dynamic
 

23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,190
dynamic programming so what's dynamic
what's the dynamic what's the opposite

24
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
what's the dynamic what's the opposite
 

25
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,709
what's the dynamic what's the opposite
of dynamic

26
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
of dynamic
 

27
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,709
of dynamic
uh what's dynamic what does it mean

28
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
uh what's dynamic what does it mean
 

29
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,830
uh what's dynamic what does it mean
something like sound so

30
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
something like sound so
 

31
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,110
something like sound so
dynamic means you know and the opposite

32
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
dynamic means you know and the opposite
 

33
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,029
dynamic means you know and the opposite
will be static

34
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
will be static
 

35
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,709
will be static
static yeah static dynamic yeah dynamic

36
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
static yeah static dynamic yeah dynamic
 

37
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,470
static yeah static dynamic yeah dynamic
programming so it's very

38
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
programming so it's very
 

39
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,069
programming so it's very
it's not easy to understand what it

40
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
it's not easy to understand what it
 

41
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,910
it's not easy to understand what it
means from there from the

42
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
means from there from the
 

43
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,590
means from there from the
phone just look uh reading these two

44
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
phone just look uh reading these two
 

45
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,509
phone just look uh reading these two
words so if i give you one example yeah

46
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
words so if i give you one example yeah
 

47
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,550
words so if i give you one example yeah
so it's like the way we store the

48
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
so it's like the way we store the
 

49
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,469
so it's like the way we store the
intermediate result there's nothing

50
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
intermediate result there's nothing
 

51
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,630
intermediate result there's nothing
there so don't look at it so for example

52
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
there so don't look at it so for example
 

53
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,550
there so don't look at it so for example
if i give you

54
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
if i give you
 

55
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,030
if i give you
uh five apples yeah you have five

56
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
uh five apples yeah you have five
 

57
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,390
uh five apples yeah you have five
percent

58
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
percent
 

59
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,109
percent
no no and then i later like five seconds

60
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
no no and then i later like five seconds
 

61
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,710
no no and then i later like five seconds
later i give you one more so how many of

62
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
later i give you one more so how many of
 

63
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,710
later i give you one more so how many of
them all together six

64
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
them all together six
 

65
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,710
them all together six
let's anime programming because you

66
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
let's anime programming because you
 

67
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,149
let's anime programming because you
don't count from the start

68
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
don't count from the start
 

69
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,630
don't count from the start
yeah you know already know what you got

70
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
yeah you know already know what you got
 

71
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,670
yeah you know already know what you got
is five

72
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
is five
 

73
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,710
is five
and you you're given one more so you

74
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
and you you're given one more so you
 

75
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,630
and you you're given one more so you
just reuse the result the fight

76
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
just reuse the result the fight
 

77
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,469
just reuse the result the fight
you you're not counting it from start

78
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
you you're not counting it from start
 

79
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,789
you you're not counting it from start
one two three four five

80
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
one two three four five
 

81
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,469
one two three four five
does it make sense

82
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479

 

83
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,270

so you tell me what it is okay f n

84
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
so you tell me what it is okay f n
 

85
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,990
so you tell me what it is okay f n
equals

86
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
equals
 

87
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,350
equals
f n minus one plus f n minus two

88
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360

 

89
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,789

what does it mean this item

90
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
what does it mean this item
 

91
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,789
what does it mean this item
is the sum of the previous two items

92
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799

 

93
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,149

1 1 2 3 5

00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
1 1 2 3 5
 

95
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,140
1 1 2 3 5
8 13 what's this

96
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,150
8 13 what's this
 

97
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,830
8 13 what's this

say retirement x
 

105
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,670
say retirement x
let's make it zero one one two okay so

106
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
let's make it zero one one two okay so
 

107
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,190
let's make it zero one one two okay so
let's return n yeah

108
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
let's return n yeah
 

109
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,390
let's return n yeah
and then return

110
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
and then return
 

111
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,589
and then return
f n plus s m minus one

112
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
f n plus s m minus one
 

113
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,710
f n plus s m minus one
plus fn minus two am i minus ten

114
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
plus fn minus two am i minus ten
 

115
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,550
plus fn minus two am i minus ten
okay yes oh so this is recursion yeah

116
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
okay yes oh so this is recursion yeah
 

117
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,589
okay yes oh so this is recursion yeah
but do you see the problem of this

118
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
but do you see the problem of this
 

119

169
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,749

do you see the problem ryan come on

170
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
do you see the problem ryan come on
 

171
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,670
do you see the problem ryan come on
so it's it's right there what's the

172
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
so it's it's right there what's the
 

173
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,909
so it's it's right there what's the
problem release

174
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
problem release
 

175
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,990
problem release
it's like a bunny between yeah it's the

176
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
it's like a bunny between yeah it's the
 

177
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,189
it's like a bunny between yeah it's the
battery but look

178
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
battery but look
 

179
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,350
battery but look
i want to calculate f4 by using this

180
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
i want to calculate f4 by using this
 

181
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,270
i want to calculate f4 by using this
code right the question

182
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
code right the question
 

183
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,749
code right the question
i i need to calculate f3 and f2 yeah

184
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
i i need to calculate f3 and f2 yeah
 

185
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,350
i i need to calculate f3 and f2 yeah
there are two function chords

186
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
there are two function chords
 

187
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,350
there are two function chords
in order to character s3 i need to kick

188
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
in order to character s3 i need to kick
 

189
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,629
in order to character s3 i need to kick
the f2 and f1

190
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
the f2 and f1
 

191
00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:01,430
the f2 and f1
in order to calculate f2 i need to get

192
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440

 

193
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,749

do you see the problem do you see the

194
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
do you see the problem do you see the
 

195
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,029
do you see the problem do you see the
problem it's right there

196
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
problem it's right there
 

197
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,629
problem it's right there
what's the problem what's the problem of

198
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
what's the problem what's the problem of
 

199
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,150
what's the problem what's the problem of
this this is not

200
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
this this is not
 

201
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,189
this this is not
symmetrical no what

202
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
symmetrical no what
 

203
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,430
symmetrical no what
i give you a hint it's something that

204
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
i give you a hint it's something that
 

205
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,950
i give you a hint it's something that
has been

206
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
has been
 

207
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,390
has been
calculated more than once

208
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
calculated more than once
 

209
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,510
calculated more than once
once which one one and zero

210
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
once which one one and zero
 

211
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,830
once which one one and zero
and two two two yeah you see because

212
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
and two two two yeah you see because
 

213
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,909
and two two two yeah you see because
look f2

214
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
look f2
 

215
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,230
look f2
i want to calculate f2 and then here i

216
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
i want to calculate f2 and then here i
 

217
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,029
i want to calculate f2 and then here i
order again

218
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
order again
 

219
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,550
order again
and can you imagine there are lots of

220
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
and can you imagine there are lots of
 

221
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,310
and can you imagine there are lots of
things coming up yeah

222
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
things coming up yeah
 

223
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,909
things coming up yeah
if f5 and then you'll find f3 somewhere

224
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
if f5 and then you'll find f3 somewhere
 

225
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,830
if f5 and then you'll find f3 somewhere
you calculate again and again and this

226
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
you calculate again and again and this
 

227
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,909
you calculate again and again and this
this grows exponential

228
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
this grows exponential
 

229
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,350
this grows exponential
do you get it do you see it

230
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
do you get it do you see it
 

231
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,390
do you get it do you see it
yeah this is the problem yeah because i

232
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
yeah this is the problem yeah because i
 

233
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,070
yeah this is the problem yeah because i
want to calculate f3 and then i need to

234
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
want to calculate f3 and then i need to
 

235
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,670
want to calculate f3 and then i need to
click the f2

236
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
click the f2
 

237
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,909
click the f2
but somehow f2 is being calculated here

238
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
but somehow f2 is being calculated here
 

239
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,189
but somehow f2 is being calculated here
and i also i have

240
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
and i also i have
 

241
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,670
and i also i have
no matter how complex is f2 i need to do

242
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
no matter how complex is f2 i need to do
 

243
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,590
no matter how complex is f2 i need to do
it again

244
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
it again
 

245
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,390
it again
yeah so it's like i give you five apples

246
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
yeah so it's like i give you five apples
 

247
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,070
yeah so it's like i give you five apples
i give you one more

248
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
i give you one more
 

249
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,309
i give you one more
you can you calculate it you count it

250
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
you can you calculate it you count it
 

251
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,150
you can you calculate it you count it
again one upper two or four three before

252
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
again one upper two or four three before
 

253
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,189
again one upper two or four three before
i put five four

254
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
i put five four
 

255
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,670
i put five four
and then you know you now know six zero

256
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
and then you know you now know six zero
 

257
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,189
and then you know you now know six zero
and now you have six airport i give you

258
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
and now you have six airport i give you
 

259
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,590
and now you have six airport i give you
one

260
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
one
 

261
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,070
one
more point get one two three four five

262
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
more point get one two three four five
 

263
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,670
more point get one two three four five
six seven you're not doing that right

264
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
six seven you're not doing that right
 

265
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,150
six seven you're not doing that right
right

266
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
right
 

267
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,790
right
you could just go next number big by b4

268
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
you could just go next number big by b4
 

269
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,189
you could just go next number big by b4
yeah

270
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
yeah
 

271
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,350
yeah
that's right so what's the technology

272
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
that's right so what's the technology
 

273
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,270
that's right so what's the technology
here so you're not counting it from this

274
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
here so you're not counting it from this
 

275
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,350
here so you're not counting it from this
beginning because it takes time and it's

276
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
beginning because it takes time and it's
 

277
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,150
beginning because it takes time and it's
you are already you calculated the thing

278
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
you are already you calculated the thing
 

279
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,670
you are already you calculated the thing
you already know right

280
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
you already know right
 

281
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,189
you already know right
it's it's like you already know there

282
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
it's it's like you already know there
 

283
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,950
it's it's like you already know there
are five of us and then you're counting

284
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
are five of us and then you're counting
 

285
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,670
are five of us and then you're counting
it again

286
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
it again
 

287
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,029
it again
yeah because you're not remembering okay

288
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
yeah because you're not remembering okay
 

289
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,909
yeah because you're not remembering okay
so how to remembering i'll give you a

290
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
so how to remembering i'll give you a
 

291
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,390
so how to remembering i'll give you a
hint

292
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
hint
 

293
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,510
hint
it's a it's a it's a word i i talk about

294
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
it's a it's a it's a word i i talk about
 

295
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,350
it's a it's a it's a word i i talk about
that a lot

296
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
that a lot
 

297
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,430
that a lot
what what kind of data structure are we

298
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
what what kind of data structure are we
 

299
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,270
what what kind of data structure are we
using to remember

300
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
using to remember
 

301
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,909
using to remember
remember yes that is facebook notebook

302
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
remember yes that is facebook notebook
 

303
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,029
remember yes that is facebook notebook
facebook okay

304
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
facebook okay
 

305
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,909
facebook okay
so look the problem of this is that we

306
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
so look the problem of this is that we
 

307
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,990
so look the problem of this is that we
are we are not remembering

308
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
are we are not remembering
 

309
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,350
are we are not remembering
the results

310
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
the results
 

311
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,150
the results
right if if we're remembering this

312
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
right if if we're remembering this
 

313
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,510
right if if we're remembering this
if we calculate the first time we

314
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
if we calculate the first time we
 

315
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,909
if we calculate the first time we
calculate f2 yeah

316
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
calculate f2 yeah
 

317
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,990
calculate f2 yeah
we save this we save this into a

318
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
we save this we save this into a
 

319
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,670
we save this we save this into a
notebook and then

320
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
notebook and then
 

321
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,830
notebook and then
when we come here f2 now we know already

322
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
when we come here f2 now we know already
 

323
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,469
when we come here f2 now we know already
f2

324
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
f2
 

325
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,790
f2
right so we no need to calculate again

326
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
right so we no need to calculate again
 

327
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,710
right so we no need to calculate again
right we can just get a value from

328
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
right we can just get a value from
 

329
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,309
right we can just get a value from
the notebook all right so let's

330
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:28,319
the notebook all right so let's
 

331
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,670
the notebook all right so let's
dynamic programming to get it

332
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
dynamic programming to get it
 

333
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,110
dynamic programming to get it
so let's recursion but with the notebook

334
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
so let's recursion but with the notebook
 

335
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,950
so let's recursion but with the notebook
actually it's not notebook but notebook

336
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
actually it's not notebook but notebook
 

337
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,550
actually it's not notebook but notebook
is for your understanding

338
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
is for your understanding
 

339
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,390
is for your understanding
in in in computer science it's called

340
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
in in in computer science it's called
 

341
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,110
in in in computer science it's called
this

342
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
this
 

343
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,869
this
me mo my zation

344
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
me mo my zation
 

345
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,469
me mo my zation
what does it mean memorization

346
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
what does it mean memorization
 

347
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,629
what does it mean memorization
yeah recursion with the minimalization

348
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
yeah recursion with the minimalization
 

349
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,790
yeah recursion with the minimalization
so how do we do this

350
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
so how do we do this
 

351
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,950
so how do we do this
what does this move

352
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
what does this move
 

353
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,309
what does this move
what does this mean look

354
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
what does this mean look
 

355
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,990
what does this mean look
we can do this put a notebook yeah

356
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
we can do this put a notebook yeah
 

357
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,189
we can do this put a notebook yeah
equals

358
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199

 

359
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:20,309

uh we can just

360
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319

 

361
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,230

f n minus 1 plus f minus 2 okay

362
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
f n minus 1 plus f minus 2 okay
 

363
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,430
f n minus 1 plus f minus 2 okay
so now i want to put it look it here so

364
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
so now i want to put it look it here so
 

365
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,830
so now i want to put it look it here so
look

366
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840

 

367
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,310

and in notebook

368
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
and in notebook
 

369
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,149
and in notebook
return notebook

370
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
return notebook
 

371
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,589
return notebook
end and now i need to say

372
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
end and now i need to say
 

373
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,230
end and now i need to say
value equals and then what should i do i

374
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
value equals and then what should i do i
 

375
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,550
value equals and then what should i do i
should put it in the notebook right

376
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
should put it in the notebook right
 

377
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,910
should put it in the notebook right
yeah so notebook and

378
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
yeah so notebook and
 

379
00:08:49,920 --> 00:09:00,530
yeah so notebook and
equals y equals

380
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:00,540

 

381
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,150

what are we calculating yeah ryan any

384
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
what are we calculating yeah ryan any
 

385
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,310
what are we calculating yeah ryan any
f what's f f is a function name come on

386
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,320
f what's f f is a function name come on
 

387
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,350
f what's f f is a function name come on
value value

388
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
value value
 

389
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,190
value value
look this is the value we put it in the

390
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
look this is the value we put it in the
 

391
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,269
look this is the value we put it in the
notebook do you get it underneath

392
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
notebook do you get it underneath
 

393
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,470
notebook do you get it underneath
this bit is to check if this n is in the

394
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
this bit is to check if this n is in the
 

395
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,269
this bit is to check if this n is in the
notebook

396
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
notebook
 

397
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,509
notebook
if it's in the notebook it means we have

398
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
if it's in the notebook it means we have
 

399
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,590
if it's in the notebook it means we have
calculated it before right

400
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
calculated it before right
 

401
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,630
calculated it before right
so we don't calculate we just return the

402
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
so we don't calculate we just return the
 

403
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,990
so we don't calculate we just return the
value

404
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
value
 

405
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,430
value
okay yeah okay so this whole thing

406
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
okay yeah okay so this whole thing
 

407
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,509
okay yeah okay so this whole thing
we don't need to do that that's one

408
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
we don't need to do that that's one
 

409
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,710
we don't need to do that that's one
magic

410
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
magic
 

411
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,350
magic
erase this it raise this

412
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
erase this it raise this
 

413
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,350
erase this it raise this
it raise this just go back to the

414
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
it raise this just go back to the
 

415
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,670
it raise this just go back to the
beginning okay return yeah

416
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
beginning okay return yeah
 

417
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,590
beginning okay return yeah
yeah return this yeah this is a

418
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
yeah return this yeah this is a
 

419
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,030
yeah return this yeah this is a
recursion yeah

420
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
recursion yeah
 

421
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,630
recursion yeah
all we have to do is

422
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
all we have to do is
 

423
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,949
all we have to do is
add something here at lru

424
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
add something here at lru
 

425
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,030
add something here at lru
this recently you need cash

426
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
this recently you need cash
 

427
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,829
this recently you need cash
and now we can specify a size max size

428
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
and now we can specify a size max size
 

429
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,110
and now we can specify a size max size
equals nut so

430
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
equals nut so
 

431
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,949
equals nut so
so this is just to to ask computer to

432
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
so this is just to to ask computer to
 

433
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,710
so this is just to to ask computer to
cache this function impossible

434
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
cache this function impossible
 

435
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,949
cache this function impossible
so the computer when we recursively call

436
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
so the computer when we recursively call
 

437
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,870
so the computer when we recursively call
is f2 for example f2 yeah

438
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
is f2 for example f2 yeah
 

439
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,710
is f2 for example f2 yeah
then if we check if it's already

440
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
then if we check if it's already
 

441
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,230
then if we check if it's already
calculated before

442
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
calculated before
 

443
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,550
calculated before
you won't continue you will just return

444
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
you won't continue you will just return
 

445
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,910
you won't continue you will just return
the value

446
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
the value
 

447
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,949
the value
right so i can't remember that

448
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
right so i can't remember that
 

449
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,829
right so i can't remember that
that's okay that's okay that's okay but

450
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
that's okay that's okay that's okay but
 

451
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,509
that's okay that's okay that's okay but
you can remember the notebook thing yeah

452
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
you can remember the notebook thing yeah
 

453
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:31,990
you can remember the notebook thing yeah
it's the same

454
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
it's the same
 

455
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,710
it's the same
thing air are you cash cash you know

456
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
thing air are you cash cash you know
 

457
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,069
thing air are you cash cash you know
what's cash

458
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
what's cash

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
it's like uh uh
 

467
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,829
it's like uh uh
it's it's like something you want to use

it's it's like something you want to use
 

469
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,630
it's it's like something you want to use
frequently and then you don't need to go

470
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
frequently and then you don't need to go
 

471
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,630
frequently and then you don't need to go
and do it again you can just

472
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
and do it again you can just
 

473
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,350
and do it again you can just
just put it on the someplace that you

474
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
just put it on the someplace that you
 

475
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,069
just put it on the someplace that you
can fetch it

476
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
can fetch it
 

477
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,069
can fetch it
quickly cache okay a storage

notebook yeah

486
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
notebook yeah
 

487
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,150
notebook yeah
a storage okay so look five airports

488
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
a storage okay so look five airports
 

489
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,550
a storage okay so look five airports
yeah then you know in your memory you

490
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
yeah then you know in your memory you
 

491
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,389
yeah then you know in your memory you
know there's a place called

492
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
know there's a place called
 

493
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,470
know there's a place called
you'll now have five apples and the next

494
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
you'll now have five apples and the next
 

495
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,230
you'll now have five apples and the next
time

496
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
time
 

497
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,829
time
you're given one airport you'll ask

498
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
you're given one airport you'll ask
 

499
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,829
you're given one airport you'll ask
yourself how many of us do i have right

500
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
yourself how many of us do i have right
 

501
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,710
yourself how many of us do i have right
now

502
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
now
 

503
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,949
now
i have fireballs and then i can just say

504
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
i have fireballs and then i can just say
 

505
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,430
i have fireballs and then i can just say
okay i get these five apples

506
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
okay i get these five apples
 

507
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,190
okay i get these five apples
and then plus one so i will have six

508
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
and then plus one so i will have six
 

509
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,470
and then plus one so i will have six
reports

510
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
reports
 

511
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,110
reports
and then you update in the cache and

512
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
and then you update in the cache and
 

513
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,990
and then you update in the cache and
then it will become

514
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
then it will become
 

515
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,150
then it will become
six and next time you're given one apple

516
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
six and next time you're given one apple
 

517
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,430
six and next time you're given one apple
and you you go and

518
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
and you you go and
 

519
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,630
and you you go and
ask ask the cash how many apples do i

520
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
ask ask the cash how many apples do i
 

521
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,150
ask ask the cash how many apples do i
have now six

522
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
have now six
 

523
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,190
have now six
yeah and then six plus one you were

524
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
yeah and then six plus one you were
 

525
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,030
yeah and then six plus one you were
seven and then you go back to update the

526
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
seven and then you go back to update the
 

527
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,150
seven and then you go back to update the
cash

528
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
cash
 

529
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,750
cash
if you don't have this cash what

530
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
if you don't have this cash what
 

531
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,910
if you don't have this cash what
happened you need to do this heavy work

532
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
happened you need to do this heavy work
 

533
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,590
happened you need to do this heavy work
you need to count apple from one two

534
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
you need to count apple from one two
 

535
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,949
you need to count apple from one two
three four five seven

536
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
three four five seven
 

537
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,190
three four five seven
imagine you you are given a million

538
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
imagine you you are given a million
 

539
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,150
imagine you you are given a million
apples

540
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
apples
 

541
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,949
apples
like you take time right but if you have

542
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
like you take time right but if you have
 

543
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,790
like you take time right but if you have
a cache a place

544
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
a cache a place
 

545
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,269
a cache a place
memory to tell you how many apples do

546
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
memory to tell you how many apples do
 

547
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,269
memory to tell you how many apples do
you need to go there

548
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
you need to go there
 

549
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,590
you need to go there
no right yeah i need and this will be

cash so we could look this is the

558
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
cash so we could look this is the
 

559
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,389
cash so we could look this is the
question recursion with

question recursion with
 

561
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,310
question recursion with
with cash minimization yeah minimization

562
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
with cash minimization yeah minimization
 

563
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,670
with cash minimization yeah minimization
the thing i talked about

564
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680

or vp
 

575
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,710
or vp
dynamic programming this is very

576
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
dynamic programming this is very
 

577
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,870
dynamic programming this is very
advanced technology okay

578
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
advanced technology okay
 

579
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,990
advanced technology okay
lungs aggregate dynamic programming

580
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
lungs aggregate dynamic programming
 

581
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,389
lungs aggregate dynamic programming
got it yeah all right

582
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399

 

583
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,069

so can you write the fibonacci number

584
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
so can you write the fibonacci number
 

585
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,470
so can you write the fibonacci number
okay so one more time okay i already one

00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
what's d oh look dynamic programming
 

593
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,110
what's d oh look dynamic programming
you can write it look this way yeah

594
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
you can write it look this way yeah
 

595
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,829
you can write it look this way yeah
define

611
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:12,160

minus one plus

612
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,170

 

613
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:27,430

[Music]

614
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440

 

615
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,470

and then i need to go go top down f n

616
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
and then i need to go go top down f n
 

617
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,670
and then i need to go go top down f n
minus one and

618
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
minus one and
 

619
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,629
minus one and
f n minus two and then these will be f

620
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
f n minus two and then these will be f
 

621
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,990
f n minus two and then these will be f
and minus two

622
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
and minus two
 

623
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,189
and minus two
f minus three yeah look top

624
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
f minus three yeah look top
 

625
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,590
f minus three yeah look top
down yeah so this is dynamic programming

626
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
down yeah so this is dynamic programming
 

627
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:43,910
down yeah so this is dynamic programming
we

628
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
we
 

629
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,150
we
again we we call it top down because

630
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
again we we call it top down because
 

631
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,350
again we we call it top down because
look the way you

632
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
look the way you
 

633
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,189
look the way you
you are calculating this from top to

634
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
you are calculating this from top to
 

635
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,509
you are calculating this from top to
down yeah actually top down yeah

636
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
down yeah actually top down yeah
 

637
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,790
down yeah actually top down yeah
top down dynamic programming and you is

638
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
top down dynamic programming and you is
 

639
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,750
top down dynamic programming and you is
usually

640
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
usually
 

641
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,990
usually
implemented using recursion with a

642
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
implemented using recursion with a
 

643
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,069
implemented using recursion with a
notebook with the memorization it's

644
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
notebook with the memorization it's
 

645
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,509
notebook with the memorization it's
called

646
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
called
 

647
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,750
called
recursion with the minimization it's

648
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
recursion with the minimization it's
 

649
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,550
recursion with the minimization it's
very this is very important if you don't

650
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
very this is very important if you don't
 

651
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,910
very this is very important if you don't
memorize the results not the values

652
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
memorize the results not the values
 

653
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,910
memorize the results not the values
it's not the core dynamic programming

654
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:11,920
it's not the core dynamic programming
 

655
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,150
it's not the core dynamic programming
yeah the beauty of dynamic programming

656
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
yeah the beauty of dynamic programming
 

657
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,430
yeah the beauty of dynamic programming
is that you don't calculate those

658
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
is that you don't calculate those
 

659
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,110
is that you don't calculate those
intermediate values over and over again

660
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
intermediate values over and over again
 

661
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,870
intermediate values over and over again
so let's speeds up right

662
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
so let's speeds up right
 

663
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,470
so let's speeds up right
if you're calculating these f4 f2

664
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
if you're calculating these f4 f2
 

665
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,389
if you're calculating these f4 f2
again and again again it's going to take

666
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
again and again again it's going to take
 

667
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,829
again and again again it's going to take
forever it's going to take

668
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
forever it's going to take
 

669
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,550
forever it's going to take
exponential time but with this moment

670
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
exponential time but with this moment
 

671
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,829
exponential time but with this moment
memorization

672
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
memorization
 

673
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,069
memorization
for fn how many times you just have to

674
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079
for fn how many times you just have to
 

675
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,310
for fn how many times you just have to
calculate it

676
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,320
calculate it
 

677
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,430
calculate it
uh what n because

678
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
uh what n because
 

679
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,269
uh what n because
for each for each value let's say

680
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
for each for each value let's say
 

681
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,790
for each for each value let's say
f10 so i just need to calculate f9

682
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800
f10 so i just need to calculate f9
 

683
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,150
f10 so i just need to calculate f9
fa f7 tier x1 f0

684
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
fa f7 tier x1 f0
 

685
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,990
fa f7 tier x1 f0
all these numbers only calculate once

686
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
all these numbers only calculate once
 

687
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,069
all these numbers only calculate once
right yes

688
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
right yes
 

689
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,550
right yes
why is that because if it's calculated i

690
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
why is that because if it's calculated i
 

691
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,389
why is that because if it's calculated i
can put it in the notebook

692
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
can put it in the notebook
 

693
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,629
can put it in the notebook
and next time you want it i just get it

694
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
and next time you want it i just get it
 

695
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,590
and next time you want it i just get it
right

696
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
right
 

697
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,310
right
yes so look recursion with the

698
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
yes so look recursion with the
 

699
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,350
yes so look recursion with the
memorization

700
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
memorization
 

701
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,189
memorization
dynamic programming the complexity for

702
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
dynamic programming the complexity for
 

703
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,389
dynamic programming the complexity for
the fibonacci number is

704
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
the fibonacci number is
 

705
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,509
the fibonacci number is
r1

706
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519

 

707
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,230

oh and it goes back in time but we love

708
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,240
oh and it goes back in time but we love
 

709
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,710
oh and it goes back in time but we love
the minimization

710
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
the minimization
 

711
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,150
the minimization
without repeat i won it's what

712
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
without repeat i won it's what
 

713
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,230
without repeat i won it's what
it's over and square

714
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240

 

715
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,350

not quite close it's look on them

716
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
not quite close it's look on them
 

717
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,230
not quite close it's look on them
no look look each one you spawn two

718
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
no look look each one you spawn two
 

719
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,069
no look look each one you spawn two
possibilities each one is going to

720
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
possibilities each one is going to
 

721
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,150
possibilities each one is going to
possibility

722
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
possibility
 

723
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,189
possibility
and keep it two to the power n

724
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
and keep it two to the power n
 

725
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,629
and keep it two to the power n
exponential got it yeah

726
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
exponential got it yeah
 

727
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,949
exponential got it yeah
because at each one you have two spawn

728
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
because at each one you have two spawn
 

729
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,110
because at each one you have two spawn
two each one you have two

730
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
two each one you have two
 

731
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,470
two each one you have two
do to get it so it's exponential look

732
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
do to get it so it's exponential look
 

733
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,829
do to get it so it's exponential look
o 2 n and o 1 which is better

734
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
o 2 n and o 1 which is better
 

735
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,110
o 2 n and o 1 which is better
yeah of course because look o n is this

736
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
yeah of course because look o n is this
 

737
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,550
yeah of course because look o n is this
o 2 n is what

738
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560

 

739
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,829

yeah so when n is 10 2

740
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
yeah so when n is 10 2
 

741
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,230
yeah so when n is 10 2
n is 1024 but 10

742
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
n is 1024 but 10
 

743
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,669
n is 1024 but 10
oh n is just 10. yeah you got it

744
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
oh n is just 10. yeah you got it
 

745
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,110
oh n is just 10. yeah you got it
yeah this this 2n graph is a lot higher

746
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
yeah this this 2n graph is a lot higher
 

747
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,669
yeah this this 2n graph is a lot higher
right

748
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
right
 

749
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,270
right
this is the iron okay

750
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280

 

751
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,029

yes okay so this top down

752
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
yes okay so this top down
 

753
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,789
yes okay so this top down
dynamic programming we also can

754
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
dynamic programming we also can
 

755
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,789
dynamic programming we also can
calculate from bottom up by dynamic

756
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
calculate from bottom up by dynamic
 

757
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,750
calculate from bottom up by dynamic
programming

758
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
programming
 

759
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,110
programming
look if we calculate from this direction

760
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
look if we calculate from this direction
 

761
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,310
look if we calculate from this direction
yeah we can calculate f0 first f1 and

762
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
yeah we can calculate f0 first f1 and
 

763
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,830
yeah we can calculate f0 first f1 and
then we can tell you f2

764
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
then we can tell you f2
 

765
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,230
then we can tell you f2
f3 f4 f5 until f10 got it

766
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
f3 f4 f5 until f10 got it
 

767
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,190
f3 f4 f5 until f10 got it
so dc symbology number f10 top down we

768
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
so dc symbology number f10 top down we
 

769
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,029
so dc symbology number f10 top down we
can't we also calculate f10

770
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
can't we also calculate f10
 

771
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,990
can't we also calculate f10
now we calculate f a and f9 and in order

772
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
now we calculate f a and f9 and in order
 

773
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,029
now we calculate f a and f9 and in order
to calculate f9

774
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,039
to calculate f9
 

775
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,430
to calculate f9
i need to cancel f a and f7 let's top

776
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
i need to cancel f a and f7 let's top
 

777
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,789
i need to cancel f a and f7 let's top
down right

778
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
down right
 

779
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,630
down right
it's called it's implemented by

780
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
it's called it's implemented by
 

781
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,470
it's called it's implemented by
recursion with the minimization you got

782
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
recursion with the minimization you got
 

783
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,750
recursion with the minimization you got
it this far

784
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760

 

785
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,830

i want to calculate f10 but let's take

786
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
i want to calculate f10 but let's take
 

787
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,669
i want to calculate f10 but let's take
the f zero f1 first

788
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679
the f zero f1 first
 

789
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,190
the f zero f1 first
f0 f1 and then i can kill the f2 yeah

790
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
f0 f1 and then i can kill the f2 yeah
 

791
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,029
f0 f1 and then i can kill the f2 yeah
f1 and f2 i can kick the f3 got it

792
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
f1 and f2 i can kick the f3 got it
 

793
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,230
f1 and f2 i can kick the f3 got it
yeah so how do we do it look

794
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
yeah so how do we do it look
 

795
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,230
yeah so how do we do it look
we can just do this yeah

796
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240

 

797
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,070

f let's just call the first one f0 and

798
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
f let's just call the first one f0 and
 

799
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,630
f let's just call the first one f0 and
f1

800
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
f1
 

801
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,470
f1
okay equals zero one okay yeah

802
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
okay equals zero one okay yeah
 

803
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,110
okay equals zero one okay yeah
then for i in range

804
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
then for i in range
 

805
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,630
then for i in range
i okay then n and f

806
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
i okay then n and f
 

807
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,630
i okay then n and f
zero f one equals

808
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,640
zero f one equals
 

809
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,630
zero f one equals
equals one look f0 will become f1 right

810
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
equals one look f0 will become f1 right
 

811
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,909
equals one look f0 will become f1 right
yes yeah look

812
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
yes yeah look
 

813
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,350
yes yeah look
one one two three okay so this is f0

814
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360
one one two three okay so this is f0
 

815
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,310
one one two three okay so this is f0
this is f1

816
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320
this is f1
 

817
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,230
this is f1
so the next direction next iteration

818
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
so the next direction next iteration
 

819
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,549
so the next direction next iteration
will be f zero f1 yeah

820
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
will be f zero f1 yeah
 

821
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,750
will be f zero f1 yeah
so f0 will become the f1 and f1 will

822
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:01,760
so f0 will become the f1 and f1 will
 

823
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,630
so f0 will become the f1 and f1 will
become f01 plus s1 right

824
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:04,640
become f01 plus s1 right
 

825
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,150
become f01 plus s1 right
yes so that will be f0 plus f1

826
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
yes so that will be f0 plus f1
 

827
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,430
yes so that will be f0 plus f1
okay yes so after

828
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
okay yes so after
 

829
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,870
okay yes so after
n direction so look if f3 f3 is

830
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
n direction so look if f3 f3 is
 

831
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,110
n direction so look if f3 f3 is
that's if you want to calculate f3 so

832
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
that's if you want to calculate f3 so
 

833
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,630
that's if you want to calculate f3 so
this is three times

834
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
this is three times
 

835
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,830
this is three times
so one two three

836
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
so one two three
 

837
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,950
so one two three
so we just return within this number

838
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
so we just return within this number
 

839
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,470
so we just return within this number
which is

840
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
which is
 

841
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,230
which is
return f1 right correct

842
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,240
return f1 right correct
 

843
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,390
return f1 right correct
so typically if i want to capture f10

844
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400
so typically if i want to capture f10
 

845
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,070
so typically if i want to capture f10
fcr f1 and i will i can calculate f

846
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
fcr f1 and i will i can calculate f
 

847
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,750
fcr f1 and i will i can calculate f
look f10 5 a 13

848
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
look f10 5 a 13
 

849
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,909
look f10 5 a 13
21 okay so look this is f01 yeah

850
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919
21 okay so look this is f01 yeah
 

851
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,310
21 okay so look this is f01 yeah
and the next one is i move here i can

852
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,320
and the next one is i move here i can
 

853
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,590
and the next one is i move here i can
categorize yeah

854
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
categorize yeah
 

855
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,789
categorize yeah
i move here move here

856
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
i move here move here
 

857
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,150
i move here move here
each one f0 equals f1 f1 will be f zero

858
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
each one f0 equals f1 f1 will be f zero
 

859
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,190
each one f0 equals f1 f1 will be f zero
plus one look

860
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
plus one look
 

861
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,110
plus one look
f0 f1 f0 is the f1 will become the new

862
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
f0 f1 f0 is the f1 will become the new
 

863
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,149
f0 f1 f0 is the f1 will become the new
f0

864
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
f0
 

865
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,630
f0
and then the new s1 will become the old

866
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
and then the new s1 will become the old
 

867
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,149
and then the new s1 will become the old
f 0 and f1 right

868
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
f 0 and f1 right
 

869
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,990
f 0 and f1 right
got it okay so this is called the bottom

870
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
got it okay so this is called the bottom
 

871
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,430
got it okay so this is called the bottom
up it's also dynamic programming

872
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
up it's also dynamic programming
 

873
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,669
up it's also dynamic programming
this is also dynamic programming why is

874
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:15,679
this is also dynamic programming why is
 

875
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,590
this is also dynamic programming why is
that because we use the values

876
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
that because we use the values
 

877
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,390
that because we use the values
intermediate value yeah you see you see

878
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
intermediate value yeah you see you see
 

879
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,149
intermediate value yeah you see you see
for f2 you only calculate one

880
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:22,159
for f2 you only calculate one
 

881
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,230
for f2 you only calculate one
right it doesn't calculate again and

882
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
right it doesn't calculate again and
 

883
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,350
right it doesn't calculate again and
again right

884
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
again right
 

885
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,149
again right
so the complexity is also one

886
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:30,159

 

887
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,029

okay so do you get it so how many kind

888
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
okay so do you get it so how many kind
 

889
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,070
okay so do you get it so how many kind
of dynamic programmings we have

890
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
of dynamic programmings we have
 

891
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,110
of dynamic programmings we have
uh three two three

892
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
uh three two three
 

893
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,430
uh three two three
two what are those uh the

894
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:44,440

 

895
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,990

dino

896
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,000
dino
 

897
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,590
dino
one within

898
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600

 

899
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,669

it's called the top down right yeah and

900
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
it's called the top down right yeah and
 

901
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,830
it's called the top down right yeah and
this one is what

902
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
this one is what
 

903
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,950
this one is what
bottle up right why are we using the

904
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
bottle up right why are we using the
 

905
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,310
bottle up right why are we using the
dynamic programming to

906
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
dynamic programming to
 

907
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,090
dynamic programming to
what what's the what's the ability

908
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,100
what what's the what's the ability
 

909
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,830
what what's the what's the ability
[Music]

910
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:06,840
[Music]
 

911
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,029

memorization yeah to avoid to avoid

912
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:11,039
memorization yeah to avoid to avoid
 

913
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,669
memorization yeah to avoid to avoid
to calculate the same value again and

914
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
to calculate the same value again and
 

915
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,149
to calculate the same value again and
again

916
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
again
 

917
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,830
again
okay so this is to we use the thing

918
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
okay so this is to we use the thing
 

919
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,190
okay so this is to we use the thing
to do to avoid calculating intermediate

920
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,200
to do to avoid calculating intermediate
 

921
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,430
to do to avoid calculating intermediate
results over and over again because we

922
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
results over and over again because we
 

923
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,669
results over and over again because we
we calculate once we remember it we

924
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
we calculate once we remember it we
 

925
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,750
we calculate once we remember it we
don't come back and calculate it again

926
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
don't come back and calculate it again
 

927
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,870
don't come back and calculate it again
this is the advantage okay okay

928
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:30,880
this is the advantage okay okay
 

929
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,990
this is the advantage okay okay
that's it for today thank you bye

930
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,000
that's it for today thank you bye
 

931
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,789
that's it for today thank you bye
