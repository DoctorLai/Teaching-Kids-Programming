okay so aaron look if it's a letter and

200
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
okay so aaron look if it's a letter and
 

201
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,189
okay so aaron look if it's a letter and
do you

202
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
do you
 

203
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,030
do you
do in in python

204
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
do in in python
 

205
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,909
do in in python
if we want to get the ascii code of the

206
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
if we want to get the ascii code of the
 

207
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,230
if we want to get the ascii code of the
letter we use the function called what

208
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240

 

209
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,270

do you remember order order and then the

210
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
do you remember order order and then the
 

211
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,150
do you remember order order and then the
opposite

212
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
opposite
 

213
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,430
opposite
is chr chr 65

okay so now look so how we're doing this

224
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
okay so now look so how we're doing this
 

225
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,830
okay so now look so how we're doing this
how are we doing this

226
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
how are we doing this
 

227
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,350
how are we doing this
any idea how we're doing this no i did

228
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
any idea how we're doing this no i did
 

229
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,790
any idea how we're doing this no i did
you have no idea okay so look so we can

230
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
you have no idea okay so look so we can
 

231
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,029
you have no idea okay so look so we can
go

232
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
go
 

233
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,189
go
switch letters eric yeah we can go

234
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
switch letters eric yeah we can go
 

235
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,189
switch letters eric yeah we can go
through it it's better a a for example

236
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
through it it's better a a for example
 

237
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:33,510
through it it's better a a for example
yeah

238
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
yeah
 

239
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,830
yeah
right so look this data is

240
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
right so look this data is
 

241
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,430
right so look this data is
at the beginning is zero times a order a

242
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
at the beginning is zero times a order a
 

243
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,469
at the beginning is zero times a order a
65 and we might

244
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
65 and we might
 

245
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,230
65 and we might
please no shaking minus 65

246
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
please no shaking minus 65
 

247
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,909
please no shaking minus 65
plus one okay all right

248
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
plus one okay all right
 

249
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,950
plus one okay all right
and then we turn 26 again

250
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
and then we turn 26 again
 

251
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,189
and then we turn 26 again
that'll be eight times 26 is 26 plus

252
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
that'll be eight times 26 is 26 plus
 

253
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,950
that'll be eight times 26 is 26 plus
plus these okay and then

254
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
plus these okay and then
 

255
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,870
plus these okay and then
26 will be one right that would be 27.

256
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
26 will be one right that would be 27.
 

257
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,350
26 will be one right that would be 27.
does that make sense yeah so it will be

258
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
does that make sense yeah so it will be
 

259
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,870
does that make sense yeah so it will be
similar like

260
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
similar like
 

261
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,469
similar like
it will be similar as one

262
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
it will be similar as one
 

263
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,350
it will be similar as one
all right yeah well

264
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
all right yeah well
 

265
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,390
all right yeah well
binary do you remember 1010

266
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
binary do you remember 1010
 

267
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,990
binary do you remember 1010
what's this in in maximum

268
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000

 

269
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,629

what's this in decimal i hear music yeah

270
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
what's this in decimal i hear music yeah
 

271
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,309
what's this in decimal i hear music yeah
why isn't the music coming from

272
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
why isn't the music coming from
 

273
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,390
why isn't the music coming from
mummy mummy phone okay

274
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400

 

275
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,590

that's okay look at everything so

276
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
that's okay look at everything so
 

277
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,110
that's okay look at everything so
we go through each number right

278
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
we go through each number right
 

279
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,589
we go through each number right
at one zero one zero so let's do this

280
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
at one zero one zero so let's do this
 

281
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,309
at one zero one zero so let's do this
one

282
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
one
 

283
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,589
one
all right look one the the numbers

284
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
all right look one the the numbers
 

285
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,350
all right look one the the numbers
is one and then i every time i times two

286
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
is one and then i every time i times two
 

287
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,150
is one and then i every time i times two
and a plus the next one is zero right so

288
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
and a plus the next one is zero right so
 

289
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,309
and a plus the next one is zero right so
that will be one

290
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
that will be one
 

291
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,230
that will be one
two and two times two

292
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
two and two times two
 

293
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,270
two and two times two
plus one is five

294
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
plus one is five
 

295
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,710
plus one is five
five times two plus zero is ten so this

296
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
five times two plus zero is ten so this
 

297
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,990
five times two plus zero is ten so this
number is ten

298
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
number is ten
 

299
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,629
number is ten
doesn't make sense eric yeah listen

300
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
doesn't make sense eric yeah listen
 

301
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,189
doesn't make sense eric yeah listen
you're not

302
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
you're not
 

303
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,629
you're not
paying attention oh yes we are

304
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
paying attention oh yes we are
 

305
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,870
paying attention oh yes we are
all right look so how do we evaluate a

306
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
all right look so how do we evaluate a
 

307
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,790
all right look so how do we evaluate a
binary number look

308
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
binary number look
 

309
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,870
binary number look
one one one zero how do we evaluate this

310
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
one one one zero how do we evaluate this
 

311
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,909
one one one zero how do we evaluate this
uh we uh uh

312
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
uh we uh uh
 

313
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,950
uh we uh uh
start from the end yeah how do we

314
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
start from the end yeah how do we
 

315
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,469
start from the end yeah how do we
convert this defined into

316
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
convert this defined into
 

317
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,670
convert this defined into
a technique we can we can read it from

318
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
a technique we can we can read it from
 

319
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,629
a technique we can we can read it from
this way look

320
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
this way look
 

321
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,270
this way look
because the first number is the first

322
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
because the first number is the first
 

323
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,070
because the first number is the first
one

324
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
one
 

325
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,350
one
is zero and then zero times two plus one

326
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
is zero and then zero times two plus one
 

327
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,230
is zero and then zero times two plus one
right when we take this number is what

328
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
right when we take this number is what
 

329
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,110
right when we take this number is what
is one now

330
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
is one now
 

331
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,629
is one now
one times two plus one this is three

332
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
one times two plus one this is three
 

333
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,950
one times two plus one this is three
right so this two number is three three

334
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
right so this two number is three three
 

335
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,629
right so this two number is three three
times 2 plus 1

336
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
times 2 plus 1
 

337
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,589
times 2 plus 1
is 7 so these three number is 7 7 times

338
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
is 7 so these three number is 7 7 times
 

339
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,150
is 7 so these three number is 7 7 times
2

340
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
2
 

341
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,029
2
equals 14 plus 0 right so the whole

342
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
equals 14 plus 0 right so the whole
 

343
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,950
equals 14 plus 0 right so the whole
number is 14.

344
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
number is 14.
 

345
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,950
number is 14.
doesn't make sense so it will be

346
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
doesn't make sense so it will be
 

347
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,710
doesn't make sense so it will be
something like 1 2 3 in decimal 123

348
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
something like 1 2 3 in decimal 123
 

349
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,390
something like 1 2 3 in decimal 123
right 1 times 10 so at the beginning we

350
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
right 1 times 10 so at the beginning we
 

351
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,749
right 1 times 10 so at the beginning we
got zero zero times

352
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
got zero zero times
 

353
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,070
got zero zero times
ten plus one is ten is one right

354
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
ten plus one is ten is one right
 

355
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,909
ten plus one is ten is one right
yeah all right now we got the first

356
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
yeah all right now we got the first
 

357
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,270
yeah all right now we got the first
number is one

358
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
number is one
 

359
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,950
number is one
one times ten plus two twelve right

360
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
one times ten plus two twelve right
 

361
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,350
one times ten plus two twelve right
these two number two l plus ten

362
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
these two number two l plus ten
 

363
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,870
these two number two l plus ten
times ten plus three is one hundred

364
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
times ten plus three is one hundred
 

365
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,709
times ten plus three is one hundred
twenty three doesn't make sense

366
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
twenty three doesn't make sense
 

367
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,350
twenty three doesn't make sense
so we can evaluate from left to right

368
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
so we can evaluate from left to right
 

369
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,709
so we can evaluate from left to right
but every time we have

370
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
but every time we have
 

371
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,430
but every time we have
existing number we times it multiplied

372
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
existing number we times it multiplied
 

373
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,670
existing number we times it multiplied
by the base which is 10 in this case and

374
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
by the base which is 10 in this case and
 

375
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,430
by the base which is 10 in this case and
plus the current digit

376
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
plus the current digit
 

377
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,630
plus the current digit
doesn't make sense 123.

378
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
doesn't make sense 123.
 

379
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,550
doesn't make sense 123.
0

380
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560

 

381
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,590

so in this case look a a

382
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
so in this case look a a
 

383
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,430
so in this case look a a
right where is the music coming from i

384
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
right where is the music coming from i
 

385
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:18,470
right where is the music coming from i
think it's from the laptop

386
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480

391
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,070

okay convert okay let's say

392
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
okay convert okay let's say
 

393
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,110
okay convert okay let's say
uh this this is a square sheet okay

394
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
uh this this is a square sheet okay
 

395
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,990
uh this this is a square sheet okay
let's just do it convert okay and we

396
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
let's just do it convert okay and we
 

397
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,870
let's just do it convert okay and we
have a number

398
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
have a number
 

399
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,069
have a number
s right so look at the beginning answer

400
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
s right so look at the beginning answer
 

401
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,150
s right so look at the beginning answer
will be zero right because the beginning

402
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
will be zero right because the beginning
 

403
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,870
will be zero right because the beginning
yeah

404
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
yeah
 

405
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,310
yeah
yeah yeah and then look for

406
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
yeah yeah and then look for
 

407
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,430
yeah yeah and then look for
i in s right

408
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
i in s right
 

409
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,069
i in s right
so now answer me because it's 26 numbers

410
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
so now answer me because it's 26 numbers
 

411
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,829
so now answer me because it's 26 numbers
so it's base 26 right

412
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
so it's base 26 right
 

413
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,790
so it's base 26 right
yeah so look answer equals answer times

414
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
yeah so look answer equals answer times
 

415
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,990
yeah so look answer equals answer times
what

416
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
what
 

417
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,470
what
answer equals the time

418
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
answer equals the time
 

419
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,470
answer equals the time

number is it
 

445
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,150
number is it
which uh which because it's all capital

446
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
which uh which because it's all capital
 

447
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,949
which uh which because it's all capital
right

448
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
right
 

449
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,710
right
this capital i need to all out

450
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
this capital i need to all out
 

451
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,750
this capital i need to all out
this a because and then i need to plus

452
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
this a because and then i need to plus
 

453
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,110
this a because and then i need to plus
one

454
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
one
 

455
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,670
one
right because it starts from one not

456
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
right because it starts from one not
 

457
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,750
right because it starts from one not
yellow that's why we need to plus one

458
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
yellow that's why we need to plus one
 

459
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,269
yellow that's why we need to plus one
yeah does it make sense

460
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279

yeah okay now we have first number a
 

547
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,150
yeah okay now we have first number a
right yeah 0 equals 0

right yeah 0 equals 0
 

549
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,189
right yeah 0 equals 0
times 26 plus all the a

550
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
times 26 plus all the a
 

551
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,269
times 26 plus all the a
65 minus 65 65 plus 1 is 1 right

552
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:57,279
65 minus 65 65 plus 1 is 1 right
 

553
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,629
65 minus 65 65 plus 1 is 1 right
right and then i put a b here

554
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
right and then i put a b here
 

555
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,750
right and then i put a b here
so now answer is one one times 26

556
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
so now answer is one one times 26
 

557
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,189
so now answer is one one times 26
plus b minus a is one

00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
plus b minus a is one
 

559
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,310
plus b minus a is one
one plus one is two so now it's 28 right

560
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
one plus one is two so now it's 28 right
 

561
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,470

yeah now c 28 times
 

563
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,310
yeah now c 28 times
26 plus c minus a

564
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
26 plus c minus a
 

565
