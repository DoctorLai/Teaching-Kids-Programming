compute
 

9
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,470
compute
the angles between the sec the minute

10
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480
the angles between the sec the minute
 

11
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,789
the angles between the sec the minute
and the hour on the clock okay so what's

12
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:12,799
and the hour on the clock okay so what's
 

13
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:13,749
and the hour on the clock okay so what's
how do you draw

14
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
how do you draw
 

15
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,590
how do you draw
a three uh three o'clock

16
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,600
a three uh three o'clock
 

17
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,470
a three uh three o'clock
on the clock only the ten yeah three

18
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
on the clock only the ten yeah three
 

19
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,070
on the clock only the ten yeah three
o'clock

20
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080

 

21
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,630

okay so let's yeah okay it's not let's

22
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
okay so let's yeah okay it's not let's
 

23
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,189
okay so let's yeah okay it's not let's
show them

24
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
show them
 

25
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,990
show them
something about this is

26
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,000

 

27
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,470

how do you draw 3 3 30

28
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
how do you draw 3 3 30
 

29
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,950
how do you draw 3 3 30
3 30 yeah 3 30.

30
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
3 30 yeah 3 30.
 

31
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,709
3 30 yeah 3 30.
3 30. you sure

32
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
3 30. you sure
 

33
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,790
3 30. you sure
the thing is that when when this minute

34
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
the thing is that when when this minute
 

35
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,990
the thing is that when when this minute
moves the

36
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000
moves the
 

37
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,470
moves the
the hour will also move right it's not

38
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
the hour will also move right it's not
 

39
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,830
the hour will also move right it's not
straight

40
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
straight
 

41
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,510
straight
straightly does it make sense

42
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
straightly does it make sense
 

43
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,670
straightly does it make sense
it's half right because look it should

44
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
it's half right because look it should
 

45
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,430
it's half right because look it should
be half this is three

46
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
be half this is three
 

47
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,990
be half this is three
and then that's four here so when is 3

48
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
and then that's four here so when is 3
 

49
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,190
and then that's four here so when is 3
30.

50
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
30.
 

51
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,030
30.
yeah yeah i know so here will be yeah

52
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
yeah yeah i know so here will be yeah
 

53
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,149
yeah yeah i know so here will be yeah
so here does it make sense six all right

54
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
so here does it make sense six all right
 

55
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,789
so here does it make sense six all right
yeah seven eight so when when this

56
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
yeah seven eight so when when this
 

57
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,429
yeah seven eight so when when this
minute

58
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:17,439
minute
 

59
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,190
minute
moves when this mini moves the hour will

60
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
moves when this mini moves the hour will
 

61
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,469
moves when this mini moves the hour will
also move right

62
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
also move right
 

63
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,070
also move right
right doesn't make sense for one hour

64
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
right doesn't make sense for one hour
 

65
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,749
right doesn't make sense for one hour
okay so for one hour how many

66
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
okay so for one hour how many
 

67
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,270
okay so for one hour how many
angles does that one how many for one

68
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
angles does that one how many for one
 

69
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,630
angles does that one how many for one
hour

70
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
hour
 

71
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,230
hour
for 60 minutes how many

72
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
for 60 minutes how many
 

73
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,510
for 60 minutes how many
hours i mean the angles of our one hour

how many angles this angle right
 

77
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,030
how many angles this angle right
yeah what's this

78
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
yeah what's this
 

79
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,469
yeah what's this
how many angles a circle here you go

80
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
how many angles a circle here you go
 

81
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,670

sorry
 

87
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,510
sorry
angles look this is 90 degrees right

88
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
angles look this is 90 degrees right
 

89
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,710
angles look this is 90 degrees right
90 degrees and what's this 300 and

90
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
90 degrees and what's this 300 and
 

91
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,910
90 degrees and what's this 300 and
degrees yeah this is this is a 180 yeah

92
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
degrees yeah this is this is a 180 yeah
 

93
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,470
degrees yeah this is this is a 180 yeah
and then you

94
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
and then you
 

95
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,350
and then you
go around the third that's that's 360

96
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
go around the third that's that's 360
 

97
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,150
go around the third that's that's 360
right

98
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
right
 

99
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,390
right
yes and how many hours on the clock

100
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
yes and how many hours on the clock
 

101
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,670
yes and how many hours on the clock
12 12 so how many angle for between one

102
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
12 12 so how many angle for between one
 

103
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,869
12 12 so how many angle for between one
hour

104
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
hour
 

105
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,510
hour
if i i like hours from go from one to

106
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
if i i like hours from go from one to
 

107
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,869
if i i like hours from go from one to
three thirty degrees

108
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
three thirty degrees
 

109
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,949
three thirty degrees
thirty degrees so look three hundred

110
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
thirty degrees so look three hundred
 

111
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,790
thirty degrees so look three hundred
sixty divided by two every thirty

112
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
sixty divided by two every thirty
 

113
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,390
sixty divided by two every thirty
degrees okay so we know

114
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
degrees okay so we know
 

115
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,910
degrees okay so we know
one hour equals 30 degrees and how many

116
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
one hour equals 30 degrees and how many
 

117
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,750
one hour equals 30 degrees and how many
minutes we have in one hour

118
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
minutes we have in one hour
 

119
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,430
minutes we have in one hour
uh okay so how many angles does one

120
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
uh okay so how many angles does one
 

121
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,670
uh okay so how many angles does one
minute have

122
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
minute have
 

123
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,229
minute have
how many hours does one minute the home

124
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
how many hours does one minute the home
 

125
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:52,790
how many hours does one minute the home
angle

126
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
angle
 

127
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,229
angle
angle like this 100 this is 360 and you

128
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
angle like this 100 this is 360 and you
 

129
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,470
angle like this 100 this is 360 and you
say 60 minutes so how many

130
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
say 60 minutes so how many
 

131
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,350
say 60 minutes so how many
if the minute moves one minute which end

132
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
if the minute moves one minute which end
 

133
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,670
if the minute moves one minute which end
this small angle which is

134
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
this small angle which is
 

135
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,670
this small angle which is
what what's this one degree

136
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
what what's this one degree
 

137
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,910
what what's this one degree
no of course not one degree what is one

138
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
no of course not one degree what is one
 

139
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,790
no of course not one degree what is one
degree

140
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
degree
 

141
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,790
degree
one minute how many minutes you just say

142
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
one minute how many minutes you just say
 

143
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,350
one minute how many minutes you just say
how many minutes

144
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360

 

145
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,990

60 degrees or 60 minutes and how many

146
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
60 degrees or 60 minutes and how many
 

147
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,350
60 degrees or 60 minutes and how many
minutes how many engines

148
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
minutes how many engines
 

149
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,190
minutes how many engines
60 degrees 66 degrees right

150
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
60 degrees 66 degrees right
 

151
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,030
60 degrees 66 degrees right
yeah so minute moves one minute is 66

152
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
yeah so minute moves one minute is 66
 

153
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,070
yeah so minute moves one minute is 66
degrees right

154
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
degrees right
 

155
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,030
degrees right
yeah okay so we want to find out the

156
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
yeah okay so we want to find out the
 

157
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,949
yeah okay so we want to find out the
angle between the hour and minute the

158
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
angle between the hour and minute the
 

159
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,710
angle between the hour and minute the
smaller one right because it always has

160
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
smaller one right because it always has
 

161
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,350
smaller one right because it always has
two

162
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
two
 

163
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,589
two
the smaller one and the bigger one right

164
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
the smaller one and the bigger one right
 

165
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,030
the smaller one and the bigger one right
we want to know the smaller angle how

166
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
we want to know the smaller angle how
 

167
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,670
we want to know the smaller angle how
how can we

168
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
how can we
 

169
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,710
how can we
compute this

170
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720

 

171
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,309

the small angle like 300 uh like 330

172
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
the small angle like 300 uh like 330
 

173
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,030
the small angle like 300 uh like 330
what's the angle between 330

174
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
what's the angle between 330
 

175
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,830
what's the angle between 330
330. look three thirty this is thirty

176
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
330. look three thirty this is thirty
 

177
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,550
330. look three thirty this is thirty
yeah

178
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
yeah
 

179
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,190
yeah
three ninety degrees no it's not ninety

180
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
three ninety degrees no it's not ninety
 

181
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,830
three ninety degrees no it's not ninety
degree

182
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
degree
 

183
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,869
degree
i i just said the hour move as well

184
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
i i just said the hour move as well
 

185
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,390
i i just said the hour move as well
right look this is

186
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
right look this is
 

187
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,990
right look this is
this is three this is four

188
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
this is three this is four
 

189
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,470
this is three this is four
so one hour will be okay that's it you

190
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
so one hour will be okay that's it you
 

191
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,270
so one hour will be okay that's it you
don't need to write

192
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
don't need to write
 

193
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,670
don't need to write
look this is 30 yeah this is this is 6

194
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
look this is 30 yeah this is this is 6
 

195
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,309
look this is 30 yeah this is this is 6
right

196
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
right
 

197
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,990
right
30 yeah so what's the degree is here not

198
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
30 yeah so what's the degree is here not
 

199
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,229
30 yeah so what's the degree is here not
here this is 90 degree

200
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
here this is 90 degree
 

201
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,510
here this is 90 degree
right all right look at me this is 90

202
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
right all right look at me this is 90
 

203
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:23,990
right all right look at me this is 90
degree

204
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,000
degree
 

205
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,990
degree
but we also need to count

206
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
but we also need to count
 

207
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,990
but we also need to count
constant angle 75 degrees

208
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
constant angle 75 degrees
 

209
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,469
constant angle 75 degrees
75 degrees why is it 75 degrees can you

210
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
75 degrees why is it 75 degrees can you
 

211
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,970
75 degrees why is it 75 degrees can you
explain to me

212
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:38,980
explain to me
 

213
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,950
explain to me
[Music]

214
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
[Music]
 

215
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,390
[Music]
yeah 75 why you why you saying 75

216
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
yeah 75 why you why you saying 75
 

217
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,430
yeah 75 why you why you saying 75
you know it is half yeah

218
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440

 

219
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,030

15 and yeah exactly yeah that's that's

220
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
15 and yeah exactly yeah that's that's
 

221
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,150
15 and yeah exactly yeah that's that's
we're done good job be confident it's 75

222
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
we're done good job be confident it's 75
 

223
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,310
we're done good job be confident it's 75
because what the hour moved halfway

224
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
because what the hour moved halfway
 

225
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,150
because what the hour moved halfway
right so this is 15 degrees

226
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
right so this is 15 degrees
 

227
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,150
right so this is 15 degrees
we just said that this is 30 degrees

228
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
we just said that this is 30 degrees
 

229
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,310
we just said that this is 30 degrees
before move from three to four then it's

230
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
before move from three to four then it's
 

231
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,189
before move from three to four then it's
half

232
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
half
 

233
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,870
half
it's half that's 15 so so 90 minus 15 is

234
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
it's half that's 15 so so 90 minus 15 is
 

235
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,150
it's half that's 15 so so 90 minus 15 is
what 75 okay

236
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
what 75 okay
 

237
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,670
what 75 okay
okay so how are we approaching this

238
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
okay so how are we approaching this
 

239
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,350
okay so how are we approaching this
problem if if you

240
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
problem if if you
 

241
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,550
problem if if you
if it's h hour and m

242
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
if it's h hour and m
 

243
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,550
if it's h hour and m
minute what's the end between them if

244
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
minute what's the end between them if
 

245
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,830
minute what's the end between them if
it's hr

246
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840
it's hr
 

247
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:36,629
it's hr
minute

248
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639

 

249
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,070

so how we calculate this does it

250
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
so how we calculate this does it
 

251
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,430
so how we calculate this does it
can we calculate it as look can we

252
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
can we calculate it as look can we
 

253
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,430
can we calculate it as look can we
we know this is zero right here is

254
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
we know this is zero right here is
 

255
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,790
we know this is zero right here is
yellow yeah

256
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
yellow yeah
 

257
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,590
yellow yeah
can we calculate h angle first and now

258
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
can we calculate h angle first and now
 

259
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,390
can we calculate h angle first and now
we calculate

260
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
we calculate
 

261
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,029
we calculate
m angles minus that that will be the

262
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
m angles minus that that will be the
 

263
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,070
m angles minus that that will be the
answer right

264
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
answer right
 

265
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,189
answer right
doesn't make sense yeah

266
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
doesn't make sense yeah
 

267
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,230
doesn't make sense yeah
look like take this for example 3 30

268
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
look like take this for example 3 30
 

269
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,029
look like take this for example 3 30
right

270
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
right
 

271
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,830
right
okay what's the three hour degree three

272
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
okay what's the three hour degree three
 

273
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,070
okay what's the three hour degree three
hour but we need to catch

274
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
hour but we need to catch
 

275
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,710
hour but we need to catch
we need to count it for at least half so

276
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
we need to count it for at least half so
 

277
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,990
we need to count it for at least half so
30 minutes

278
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
30 minutes
 

279
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,749
30 minutes
how many hours divided by 60 right

280
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
how many hours divided by 60 right
 

281
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,350
how many hours divided by 60 right
yeah and plus h that's that's the

282
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
yeah and plus h that's that's the
 

283
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,670
yeah and plus h that's that's the
hour move right because hour is three

284
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
hour move right because hour is three
 

285
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,550
hour move right because hour is three
hours

286
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
hours
 

287
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,469
hours
three o'clock it moves every three yeah

288
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
three o'clock it moves every three yeah
 

289
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,629
three o'clock it moves every three yeah
but it also needs to move

290
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
but it also needs to move
 

291
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,110
but it also needs to move
half of the minutes so which is here so

292
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
half of the minutes so which is here so
 

293
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,909
half of the minutes so which is here so
it will be

294
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
it will be
 

295
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,950
it will be
h minus m divided by 30.

296
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
h minus m divided by 30.
 

297
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,230
h minus m divided by 30.
that's the total hour

298
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
that's the total hour
 

299
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,430
that's the total hour
it moves yeah i will just say it is what

300
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
it moves yeah i will just say it is what
 

301
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,790
it moves yeah i will just say it is what
it's 30 degrees right yeah right this is

302
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
it's 30 degrees right yeah right this is
 

303
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,510
it's 30 degrees right yeah right this is
the angle of

304
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
the angle of
 

305
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,350
the angle of
hour right what's the meaning of minimum

306
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360

 

307
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,070

m times

308
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080

 

309
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,070

what m times 1

310
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
what m times 1
 

311
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,029
what m times 1
6 yeah and if we minus these the

312
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
6 yeah and if we minus these the
 

313
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,830
6 yeah and if we minus these the
difference minus least that will be the

314
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840
difference minus least that will be the
 

315
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,950
difference minus least that will be the
answer compared to

316
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
answer compared to
 

317
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,430
answer compared to
so this this is the angle angle a angle

318
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
so this this is the angle angle a angle
 

319
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,749
so this this is the angle angle a angle
yeah and we need to calculate

320
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
yeah and we need to calculate
 

321
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,110
yeah and we need to calculate
a hundred minus anger and an angle which

322
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
a hundred minus anger and an angle which
 

323
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,070
a hundred minus anger and an angle which
is smaller right

324
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
is smaller right
 

325
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,670
is smaller right
because we want a smaller one right does

326
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
because we want a smaller one right does
 

327
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,110
because we want a smaller one right does
it make sense

328
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
it make sense
 

329
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,390
it make sense
yeah doesn't make sense all right

330
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
yeah doesn't make sense all right
 

331
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,670
yeah doesn't make sense all right
okay so can you explain to me can you

332
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
okay so can you explain to me can you
 

333
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,830
okay so can you explain to me can you
explain to me what um

334
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840

 

335
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,270

can you explain to me so this hour we

336
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
can you explain to me so this hour we
 

337
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,270
can you explain to me so this hour we
need to modulate by 12 as well because

338
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
need to modulate by 12 as well because
 

339
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,909
need to modulate by 12 as well because
if it's

340
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
if it's
 

341
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,990
if it's
more than if h is given from zero

342
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
more than if h is given from zero
 

343
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,270
more than if h is given from zero
uh to 12 okay we multiply by 12 okay so

344
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
uh to 12 okay we multiply by 12 okay so
 

345
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,390
uh to 12 okay we multiply by 12 okay so
it's between 0 to 11 okay

346
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
it's between 0 to 11 okay
 

347
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,830
it's between 0 to 11 okay
does it make sense all right yeah

348
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
does it make sense all right yeah
 

349
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,589
does it make sense all right yeah
okay let's buy the curve right it should

350
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
okay let's buy the curve right it should
 

351
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:56,390
okay let's buy the curve right it should
be easy this is a mathematic problem

352
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400

 

353
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,070

define anger let's say

354
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
define anger let's say
 

355
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,189
define anger let's say
our meaning right

356
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
our meaning right
 

357
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,950
our meaning right
okay look we need to first of all

358
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
okay look we need to first of all
 

359
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,589
okay look we need to first of all
get h between 0 to 11 right because

360
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
get h between 0 to 11 right because
 

361
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,270
get h between 0 to 11 right because
sometimes you say

362
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
sometimes you say
 

363
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,270
sometimes you say
21 hours right yeah 21 o'clock

364
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
21 hours right yeah 21 o'clock
 

365
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,990
21 hours right yeah 21 o'clock
yeah 24 yeah so modular equals 1

366
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
yeah 24 yeah so modular equals 1
 

367
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,189
yeah 24 yeah so modular equals 1
20 sorry

368
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
20 sorry
 

369
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,350
20 sorry
we want to make this number between zero

370
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
we want to make this number between zero
 

371
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,950
we want to make this number between zero
to twelve eleven o'clock is

372
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
to twelve eleven o'clock is
 

373
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,990
to twelve eleven o'clock is
equal to twenty three eight o'clock is

374
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
equal to twenty three eight o'clock is
 

375
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,430
equal to twenty three eight o'clock is
equals to twenty

376
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
equals to twenty
 

377
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,790
equals to twenty
percent modular twelve yeah so this will

378
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
percent modular twelve yeah so this will
 

379
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,269
percent modular twelve yeah so this will
become

380
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
become
 

381
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,829
become
the actual becomes zero to eleven right

382
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
the actual becomes zero to eleven right
 

383
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,589
the actual becomes zero to eleven right
between zero to eleven right

384
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
between zero to eleven right
 

385
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,589
between zero to eleven right
yeah okay the angle look

386
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
yeah okay the angle look
 

387
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,870
yeah okay the angle look
mini angle let's say n

388
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
mini angle let's say n
 

389
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,470
mini angle let's say n
angle minute equals

390
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
angle minute equals
 

391
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,070
angle minute equals
we know it's minute times 6 right yeah

392
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
we know it's minute times 6 right yeah
 

393
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,750
we know it's minute times 6 right yeah
yeah six degrees right all right yeah

394
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
yeah six degrees right all right yeah
 

395
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,190
yeah six degrees right all right yeah
minute so this angle times six right

396
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
minute so this angle times six right
 

397
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,630
minute so this angle times six right
is the angle between minute and

398
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
is the angle between minute and
 

399
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,990
is the angle between minute and
this zero doesn't make sense if it's 30

400
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
this zero doesn't make sense if it's 30
 

401
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,670
this zero doesn't make sense if it's 30
if it's 30 minutes what's the degree

402
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
if it's 30 minutes what's the degree
 

403
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,530
if it's 30 minutes what's the degree
uh it is

404
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:14,540

[Music]
30 minutes where is that degree

408
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
30 minutes where is that degree
 

409
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,710
30 minutes where is that degree
your degree is kind of like hey

410
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
your degree is kind of like hey
 

411
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,070
your degree is kind of like hey
so what's the answer and come on

so what's the answer and come on
 

413
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,790
so what's the answer and come on
i enter m equal m times six so what's

414
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
i enter m equal m times six so what's
 

415
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,350
i enter m equal m times six so what's
when m

416
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
when m
 

417
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,550
when m
is 30 what's the degree um

418
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
is 30 what's the degree um
 

419

00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
right right right this is the numbers on
 

493
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,870
right right right this is the numbers on
the line

494
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
the line
 

495
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,030
the line
if you put these this is abs value

496
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
if you put these this is abs value
 

497
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,990
if you put these this is abs value
absolute value

498
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
absolute value
 

499
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,910
absolute value
it means the distance between the number

500
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
it means the distance between the number
 

501
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,870
it means the distance between the number
to the zero so abs minus two equals how

502
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
to the zero so abs minus two equals how
 

503
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,269
to the zero so abs minus two equals how

511
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,310
abs minus two equals what
minus two equals two right and i'm

512
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
minus two equals two right and i'm
 

513
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,590
minus two equals two right and i'm
asking you right

514
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
asking you right
 

515
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,790
asking you right
abs minus two equals one

516
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
abs minus two equals one

distance between minus two to zero how

520
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
distance between minus two to zero how
 

521
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,550
distance between minus two to zero how
many

522

many
 

523
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,910
many
ten two okay abs one equals

524
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
ten two okay abs one equals
 

525
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,030
ten two okay abs one equals
equals what how many units between one

526
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
equals what how many units between one
 

527
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,230
equals what how many units between one
to zero

528
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
to zero
 

529
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,550
to zero
one yeah that's what you mean if it's a

530
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
one yeah that's what you mean if it's a
 

531
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,069
one yeah that's what you mean if it's a
negative number you take away the

532
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
negative number you take away the
 

533
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,590
negative number you take away the
negative if it's a positive number it

534
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
negative if it's a positive number it
 

535
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,230
negative if it's a positive number it
doesn't change

536
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
doesn't change
 

537
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,389
doesn't change
okay that's what it is so we want to

538
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
okay that's what it is so we want to
 

539
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,310
okay that's what it is so we want to
calculate the angle well the angle is

540
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
calculate the angle well the angle is
 

541
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,829
calculate the angle well the angle is
obvious to the positive yeah

542
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
obvious to the positive yeah
 

543
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,030
obvious to the positive yeah
all right yeah because sometimes the

544
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
all right yeah because sometimes the
 

545
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,590
all right yeah because sometimes the
sometimes the hour angle is bigger than

546
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
sometimes the hour angle is bigger than
 

547
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,269
sometimes the hour angle is bigger than
a minute but sometimes the mean

548
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
a minute but sometimes the mean
 

549
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,030
a minute but sometimes the mean
anger is bigger than an hour does it

550
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
anger is bigger than an hour does it
 

551
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,750
anger is bigger than an hour does it
make sense 3 30

552
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
make sense 3 30
 

553
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,389
make sense 3 30
3 30 the 30 minutes is bigger than the

554
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
3 30 the 30 minutes is bigger than the
 

555
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,509
3 30 the 30 minutes is bigger than the
hour right

556
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
hour right
 

557
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,670
hour right
3 15 the hour is bigger than a minute

558
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
3 15 the hour is bigger than a minute
 

559
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,629
3 15 the hour is bigger than a minute
all right

560
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
all right
 

561
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,110
all right
so we want to get the difference and

562
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
so we want to get the difference and
 

563
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,629
so we want to get the difference and
then we want to return the

564
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
then we want to return the
 

565
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,829
then we want to return the
retainer minima alright so what

566
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
retainer minima alright so what
 

567
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,550
retainer minima alright so what
mean answer and then

568
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
mean answer and then
 

569
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,509
mean answer and then
what we want to get a smaller angle not

570
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
what we want to get a smaller angle not
 

571
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,949
what we want to get a smaller angle not
a bigger angle so what's the

572
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
a bigger angle so what's the
 

573
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,870
a bigger angle so what's the
what's that answer

574
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
what's that answer
 

575
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,150
what's that answer
so in this this this is angle and what's

576
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
so in this this this is angle and what's
 

577
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,590
so in this this this is angle and what's
this angle

578
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
this angle
 

579
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:29,910
this angle
what's the this angle is

580
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920

 

581
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,550

yeah that's what i'm asking for yeah

582
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
yeah that's what i'm asking for yeah
 

583
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:47,350
yeah that's what i'm asking for yeah

589
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,870

we have just given two numbers and then

590
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
we have just given two numbers and then
 

591
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,590
we have just given two numbers and then
we do some mathematic calculations

592
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600

 

593
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,550

what's the space complexity i'm one yeah

594
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
what's the space complexity i'm one yeah
 

595
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,310
what's the space complexity i'm one yeah
that's it because we're only giving two

596
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
that's it because we're only giving two
 

597
