1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,359
up hello he's very miserable all right

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,040
okay so remember we talked about this uh

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,880
thing yeah

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,440
so we use the different search the

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,880
problem was uh what was the problem

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,719
is that we have a

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,880
okay so let's review this a little bit

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,600
we have this kind of map like one two

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,320
one two three three one one four in one

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,760
operation we can change any

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,920
connected

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,519
piece look this is connected connected

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,080
connected

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,320
from one color to another and we want to

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,640
find out that what's the minimum number

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,480
operation in order to make all colors

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,800
into one single chart for example in

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,000
this case we change 2

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,480
to 2

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,760
into 1 so that's going to take 2

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,800
operations

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,280
three

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,879
into one that's going to take uh two

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
operations and one operation because

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,280
this is connected and four into one that

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,039
would be another operation so one

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
two

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,680
uh one

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,640
one two three four four operations okay

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,199
so

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,920
how do we do it we we

32
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,760
the excellent would be just to count the

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,720
number of say

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,479
uh

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,400
to count from the number of the islands

36
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,479
yeah remember to talk about the iron the

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,479
connected pieces number of pieces for

38
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,040
each color and now we want to keep the

39
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,040
the color which has the most pieces

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,439
right so in because if we have we keep

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,960
the color with the most pieces then the

42
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,960
number operation will be the minimum

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,320
we change this to one okay

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,560
we change this to one

45
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,960
right or change this to one so this

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,640
would be another connected pieces right

47
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,200
so we just need uh one two three three

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,840
operations to make everything into uh

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,399
into color one so to in order to count

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,720
the number of pieces uh for each color

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,560
then we have to store it into a data

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,880
before dictionary well the keys are the

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,200
colors yeah well the keys are colors and

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,159
the values will be the number of the the

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,640
number of the pieces so the key thing

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,119
here is that we increment this as long

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,360
as we do the step research we mark the

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,319
connected pieces into minus one or

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,319
whatever and then we increment this

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,879
color kind of with one piece it means

61
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,720
that we have found another piece of a

62
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,120
connected color

63
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,800
x right so we can do this with step

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,800
research or we can do this with special

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,280
search so let's do it then with the

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,959
question what's what how do we usually

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,400
implement the breakfast search any idea

68
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:36,800
come on anything any different q q

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,120
q yeah dq yeah exactly so leave so you

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,080
so we can do this there so let's remove

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,280
this

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,720
yeah we can mark it as minus one yeah

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,519
so

74
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,599
so this function means that let's start

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,840
perform a process

76
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,840
rc

77
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,640
mean

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,959
what's the e mean

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,640
double ndq means the kill can be

80
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,640
approached uh we can have these

81
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,800
operations in two

82
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,920
this is a q double entry we can have at

83
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,440
least

84
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,040
a pen

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,840
pop

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,319
a pen left pop left yeah we can have

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,440
this push and pop operation on both

88
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,879
sides the advantage of using this dq is

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,400
that we have

90
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,440
these four operations will be the

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,640
constant operation right right

92
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,640
will be constant time okay

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,799
so

94
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,200
so if we're using the list yeah if we

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,519
are using a simple list we this can be

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,640
used as a queue a simple queue but the

97
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,799
operations of doing of using this list

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,680
on the on the left hand side would be o

99
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,920
i'm constant right it's not uh o n not

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,720
constant okay so that's why we use the

101
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,720
we prefer this double ndq

102
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,000
so dq let's put the initial one which is

103
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,239
rc

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,319
in the array okay so we're using this

105
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,200
okay and then while

106
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,599
y q is not empty now we have to

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,920
get a pixel so

108
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,440
carbon uh let's let's let's write the

109
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,680
lrcc equals q dot problem

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,680
okay cube the problem

111
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,560
okay can i use this piece

112
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,960
okay

113
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,080
q the problem okay

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,560
so now we have the kyoto problem we get

115
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,800
it from the queue and then what do we

116
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,360
need to do we need to

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,360
we need to append its neighbors which

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,280
has four directions for that so for

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,199
dr dc this is offset in four direction

120
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,040
will be one zero

121
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,199
zero one

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,040
minus one zero

123
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,639
zero minus one yeah these are the four

124
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,520
operations okay

125
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,720
uh four directions one zero one zero

126
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,039
means the one up uh

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,440
under it zero one

128
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,240
zero what does it mean zero means on the

129
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,880
left minus one zero on the left uh this

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,360
is on the right on the left zero kilo

131
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,160
one zero one on the right

132
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,919
minus one zero above it zero minus one

133
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,880
on the left

134
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,320
yeah

135
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,199
so now

136
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,800
this is the offset so the new r will be

137
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:30,479
the r r plus d r

138
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,639
and c new c would be c c plus d c and we

139
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,160
have to check this coordinate if it's in

140
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,560
range so we have

141
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,720
we can just do it if zero smaller than n

142
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,840
r

143
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,039
smaller than rows

144
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,400
and

145
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,600
right

146
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,400
cl smaller nc smaller than columns so if

147
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
this is in range also the new pixel is

148
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
not being

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,960
it's the color we want so it's the it's

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,919
a color so metric uh so we can only make

151
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,400
map

152
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,039
and r

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,479
and c equals color right if it's equals

154
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,240
color then

155
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:12,319
okay so we ryan let me stop doing that

156
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,600
so look if we are at rcc this pixel uh

157
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,800
rcc pixel and we want to find the four

158
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
directions

159
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,919
so what do in what cases

160
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,080
we can

161
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,000
append this picture back into the queue

162
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,479
okay anybody

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,479
anybody

164
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,160
yeah so

165
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,400
so this is the pixel we take it from the

166
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,560
queue and then

167
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,560
in what conditions we can we need to

168
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,080
push this neighbor back into the queue

169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,160
if if what if the

170
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,160
color this this picture the color is

171
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
what we want okay and then we push in

172
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,599
the kill then we have to change it to

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,440
mac

174
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,680
rcc

175
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,840
equals minus one so we mark it so

176
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,880
suppose this is color x and this is also

177
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,520
color x right so i just push this into a

178
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,880
q and i might make these minus ones just

179
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,560
to to avoid these being pushed back to

180
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,800
the queue again

181
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
all right and then

182
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,840
q dot append yeah the most important

183
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,120
thing kill the append rcc okay uh us uh

184
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,360
n r and c and i and c

185
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
okay and then we can just

186
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,479
and that'll be yeah because this

187
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,120
function will not

188
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,400
we uh we don't need to return anything

189
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
with the

190
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,880
function of the processor function these

191
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,440
functions would be just to

192
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,080
to say okay we want to

193
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,440
mark all the connected pieces to these

194
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,039
rc right with the color with color x

195
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,560
yeah

196
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,680
okay

197
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,440
uh

198
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,960
so that would be the perfect search

199
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,879
right that will be preferred so so we

200
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,840
can just plug in replace this with the

201
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,879
preferences and on all to continue to

202
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,639
work

203
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,759
okay

204
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,720
okay so

205
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,319
so any questions so far i mean

206
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,400
guys

207
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,400
this is the breakfast search uh the

208
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,599
color so let's let's

209
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,840
let's give an example okay

210
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,479
so just

211
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,800
to

212
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,560
you a little bit okay 1

213
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,520
1 1

214
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
2

215
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,080
2 2

216
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,039
2

217
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,479
2

218
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,720
3

219
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,720
3

220
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,639
one

221
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,240
okay

222
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,759
three

223
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,440
one two

224
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,240
two

225
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,440
one okay so which color we want to keep

226
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,360
obviously

227
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,360
one two now okay

228
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,399
let's just just go through the activity

229
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,440
to see

230
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,440
if which color we want

231
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,600
no no no you're not connected as uh

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
okay

233
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,839
so this is not connected okay i'm going

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,839
to

235
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,560
i'm going to let let's let's go through

236
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,680
the

237
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,760
editor okay so we have a dictionary data

238
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,160
yeah we have a dictionary data

239
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,120
data come on

240
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,040
oh

241
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,640
okay i'm starting at one okay and then i

242
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,320
want to mark all the connected pieces

243
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,640
using different social preferences here

244
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,880
right so that would be

245
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,760
one one one here i will change it to all

246
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,279
minus one minus one minus one so now

247
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,360
ones have three

248
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,440
uh one has one okay

249
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,720
one connected and now we skip the minus

250
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,560
one

251
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,680
two

252
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,640
the connected pieces here one

253
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,240
two and then one pieces and i i need to

254
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,080
meet we need to make it as minus one

255
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,399
minus one master just to avoid being

256
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,160
physical again three

257
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,600
three

258
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,600
only one pixel minus one

259
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,240
one

260
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,279
one here minus one

261
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,040
so we increment this one to two right

262
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,040
three

263
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,279
three minus one minus one

264
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,320
that would be an added another one so

265
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,120
two

266
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,720
right and one

267
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,399
make it minus one

268
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,240
three two three okay two

269
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,519
make it minus one minus one increment

270
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,320
one two

271
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,079
one make minus one

272
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,000
increment one four okay so now eric look

273
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,000
color one we have four piece of

274
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,240
connected number two we have two

275
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
connected three number three we have two

276
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,399
connected so which which color we should

277
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,079
keep which color is the cape from here

278
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,200
the keys that kind of the values would

279
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,040
be the number of one exactly so we keep

280
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,040
this one so the number operation will be

281
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,200
two plus two right so actually we sum up

282
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,839
the value will be four plus two plus two

283
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,320
and we get a maximum four so four plus

284
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,839
four four plus two plus two minus four

285
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,079
equals one

286
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,800
four plus two plus two this is the sum

287
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,760
minus the maximum four with this which

288
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,680
is the answer so what's the four exactly

289
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,040
let's look at the answer okay

290
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,279
yeah

291
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,440
okay so that will be

292
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,279
okay that will be for today yeah thank

293
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,519
you

294
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,519
bye bye
