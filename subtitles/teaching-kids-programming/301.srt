1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,799
hello hello mr ryan how are you today

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,519
okay so today it's a simple mess program

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,480
okay so we have at least

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,000
numbers like 2 20

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,280
30

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,199
10

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,240
50

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,520
70. this is a list of numbers right list

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,199
of numbers

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,359
y

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,240
list of numbers let's say this array

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,080
okay

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,199
and let's say we want to find out the

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,480
first

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,020
the first number that is bigger

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,600
or equals to

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,719
[Music]

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,239
let's say 50 yeah

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,160
i can equal 50 y

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,480
so which one is bigger than or this one

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,200
yeah maybe let's try a smaller number

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,320
maybe this is 300

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,960
okay

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,800
okay yeah what did you put in zero yeah

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,480
200 310 157 so which number if you go

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,520
from left to right

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,840
it's bigger or equal than 50

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,000
200

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,280
oh yeah okay so okay okay and how about

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,880
this

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,560
300.

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,560
how about this 100

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,400
yeah nothing that i need to return minus

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,560
one okay

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,560
okay

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,600
so we need to go through this we need to

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,040
find out the first number from left to

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,119
right which is bigger or

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,079
equal than the target

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,040
but 500 figures

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,600
oh yeah yeah yeah you were right okay

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,960
okay okay okay you're all right okay so

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,840
how about this is

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,200
five

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,520
you know right 70 okay we didn't mean no

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,840
yeah okay and then seven

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,159
nine

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,920
okay okay okay so how can we write this

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,560
remember this is quite similar and

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,159
looking for a number in uh

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,680
array what's the time term next day if

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,920
you're wrong to look in a number in that

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
way

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,200
what's the time complexity how how you

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,080
how important we've got a weird solution

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,520
so

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,040
so every

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,640
number on the right thing we subtract

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,760
with target and then if it's over if

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,160
it's a

61
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,879
well that's a very excellent idea so we

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,080
subtract so we subtract

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,160
we substitute these numbers

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,160
and the target we substitute the target

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,640
from the least number right and then if

66
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,239
it's negative what does it mean so this

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,200
is the number

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,640
a minus target is smaller than zero

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,360
smaller than zero right

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,840
so that means one a smaller or equal

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,640
than t right

72
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,560
right yeah

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,519
so we want to find out the first number

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,440
which is bigger so we need to be bigger

75
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,680
positive than it would be positive if

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,360
it's positive then you'll be positive

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,720
right yeah it'll be bigger or equal

78
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,519
right all right

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,879
yeah positive equal right correct

80
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,360
so it's the same thing okay so i'm going

81
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,760
to write this

82
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
define

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,360
find

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,040
first

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,480
bigger or larger bigger large

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
than topic

87
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,440
let's say this is array and then let's

88
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,760
have it okay so we want to okay let's

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,599
repeat this we want to find the numbers

90
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,319
the first number from left to right in

91
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,319
the array which is bigger or equal than

92
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,239
the target right correct if we can't

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,000
find it we'll determine

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,519
so can you tell me how to draw

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,879
if we want to go through from left to

96
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,480
right

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,640
what's the thing we want to write we

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,799
want to use the ring

99
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,680
red or we can just directly loop into

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,519
the

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,040
uh loop yeah for

102
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,920
for the number yeah

103
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,200
i

104
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,200
in

105
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,159
a r

106
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,439
if

107
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,159
i is bigger or equal than the target

108
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,680
right then we retire

109
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,680
we are not writing the index we are

110
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,000
retaining the number yeah

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,480
we return what

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,720
yeah come on give me the answer for i

113
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,799
num array if i bigger than the target

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,799
with here

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,400
in the worst case we can't find anything

116
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,080
right

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,080
yeah then that's minus one that's that's

118
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,080
pretty easy what's the space conversely

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,199
one oh

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,960
n

121
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,720
are we using any space not just guess

122
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,600
no no one yes i said i won okay i heard

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,280
that it's holland okay i said i was okay

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,520
i said that one

125
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,199
okay maybe maybe writing confused me

126
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080
okay yeah

127
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,720
no

128
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,040
i said i one okay look at the video

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,560
later

130
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,919
ryan said oh

131
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,080
oh dead oh n dance okay

132
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,880
okay and you said it was 0-1 and we

133
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,039
already said i won in the first place i

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,039
see

135
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,720
[Music]

136
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,199
if i'm bigger than t you can just move

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
the t to the left side then it will be i

138
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,080
minus t bigger than equal to zero right

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,440
it's the same yeah yeah yeah

140
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,080
okay

141
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,080
okay so now

142
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,240
not yet today we're going to talk about

143
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,400
a scene of a fancy syntax called next

144
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,919
next what's next name what's next me

145
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,600
next too

146
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,199
next yeah next one is okay daddy

147
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,720
okay next

148
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,720
i need to focus okay what's next okay so

149
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,120
what does it mean next remember you

150
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,199
still remember the iterator yeah yeah

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,479
remember the key one yeah

152
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,440
what's what's this q i mean yeah

153
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,240
what's the key word i mean yeah

154
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,160
it means that like you know promise of

155
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,319
something promise yes so so if look

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,280
for example like money won't give you

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,199
some pokemon right so maybe

158
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,199
the next month is five pounds the the

159
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,039
months of the next ten pounds and the

160
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,280
months after the next fifteen used to be

161
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,720
every week yeah yeah i know five ten

162
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,520
fifteen right

163
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,000
right okay but but mommy doesn't want to

164
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,280
give all the money to all once right so

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,479
instead

166
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,360
she was just

167
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,440
yeah

168
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,919
every time you asked for money

169
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,240
she was just year like you know yeah

170
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,199
okay so look that's the money plan okay

171
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,080
5

172
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,720
10

173
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,240
15 20 let's say okay and now we want to

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,520
put it in the

175
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,440
iterator right iterator alliteration

176
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,800
iterator so this is the list let's say

177
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,599
this is the list

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,520
this is the list m equals that i'll

179
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,479
iterate how do we get the iterator for

180
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,639
this

181
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,880
it's a rate so basically iterator what's

182
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,960
the iterator iterator has the next

183
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,360
method so if you ask you for next

184
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,560
element you will tell you what to to to

185
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,720
get it could be 5 10 15 20. so let's say

186
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,919
look the iterator will be i put the

187
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,560
eater

188
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,680
i put the eta i t e r and then i will

189
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,840
have m here that will be iterated right

190
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,599
so this is iterator let's say let's put

191
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,400
it as a

192
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,840
and then now look if i do this next

193
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,800
a

194
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,440
so

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,800
can you guess what next a gives us

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,800
next day he gave us five right yeah

197
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,120
and then look just imagine next a and

198
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,360
then if i do another next a w

199
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,240
what would you get

200
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,479
huh

201
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,720
next way you you have a

202
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,960
10 and a next day next year look that's

203
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,240
the next a means that look i get the

204
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,160
value from the iterator and internally

205
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,759
internally the iterator will move

206
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,400
there's a pointer inside yeah there was

207
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,360
a move you move to the next one okay so

208
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,240
look how about i have another eat next

209
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,360
so what what could we get

210
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,319
we could get um kai this is five this is

211
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,919
10 this is 15 and okay so what's next

212
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,759
next

213
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,639
next a

214
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,240
20 20 okay

215
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,400
good job you don't know because we're

216
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,039
running out of elements right so minus

217
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,919
one

218
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,959
the the next function the second the

219
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,279
first parameter is the iterator and the

220
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,200
second parameter is the default means

221
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,800
that if you can't get anything if you're

222
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,760
running out of the elements in the

223
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,399
iterator then returns minus one right so

224
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,560
look if i put another x here

225
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,959
next a let's say a hundred what could

226
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,959
you get

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,160
i just said what did i just say let's

228
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,240
take the first parameter as a iterator

229
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,240
and the second one is default value if

230
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,160
you are running out of the elements in

231
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,519
the iterator you give you this default

232
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,600
so next i run for aaa let's next next

233
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,720
next and then i have a

234
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,560
i have another next a 100 so what can we

235
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,120
get here

236
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,720
uh we can get the

237
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,640
100 yeah 100 that's 24 value okay so

238
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,200
now so look now we just need to

239
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,519
return okay you should i i'll write this

240
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,360
first okay all right one line

241
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,320
return

242
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,640
next

243
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,720
because i want to find the first next

244
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,480
which is also next first element is

245
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,000
bigger than the target right

246
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,800
yeah

247
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,360
look

248
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,600
look at me look at me

249
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,519
i have this this yeah

250
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,200
x for

251
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:54,000
x x i want to use x this is x for x in

252
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,720
enough array right

253
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,880
is x bigger or equal than the target

254
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,640
right okay look look

255
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,839
instead of using the

256
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,920
square bracket which is a list

257
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,240
right yeah

258
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,240
look all right

259
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,079
this is this yeah we talked about this

260
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,200
it's a tuple yeah but here here

261
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,160
here it also means the iterator okay

262
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,560
okay

263
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,720
so this you want to convert this list to

264
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
the

265
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,880
alright

266
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,800
yeah

267
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,880
what do you guys say ryan if i want to

268
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,399
convert a list to the iterator i need to

269
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,399
use the e-i-t-e-r function

270
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,839
it then you give me the iterator the

271
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,920
iterator will

272
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,760
with the iterator you can ask for the

273
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,800
next element right you could you could

274
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,760
ask the

275
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,000
next element okay

276
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,560
so look if if this one this is the

277
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,360
iterator i can just do this x for x in

278
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,480
array right if x this is the core logic

279
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,920
right because we're looking for the

280
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,399
first element which is bigger than the

281
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,880
target in the array and this is the

282
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,839
iterator and then by d4 you return -1

283
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,399
look simple as that 1

284
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:05,040
9. make sense

285
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,040
okay what have we learned about today

286
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,320
come on about the room

287
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,200
building

288
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,839
sorry yeah yeah yeah so we what we have

289
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,160
a few numbers and we are trying to find

290
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,640
the first number which is what what

291
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,839
channels which is um bigger than with

292
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,360
big or equal to that

293
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,040
to the target okay what's the time

294
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,270
complexity

295
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:36,240
that's the linear search yeah

296
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:37,760
[Music]

297
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,279
and then we're talking about the next

298
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,120
what's the next function can you tell me

299
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,040
what's the first first parameter of the

300
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,959
next function what's it what's the

301
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,519
second parameter of the next term

302
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:51,920
parameter is the next one what's this

303
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,120
first parameter what's what's a type of

304
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,120
it's kind of what

305
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,320
what type of it

306
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,080
next remember what's the next function

307
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,639
it is

308
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,760
[Music]

309
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,680
a

310
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,680
what's a come on

311
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,600
it's an iterator what did i talk about

312
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,760
what's the iterator

313
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,680
iterator iterator means that there's

314
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,440
something you can ask for the next right

315
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,920
for the next and every time you not ask

316
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,600
for the next one

317
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,800
you'll come

318
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,639
your

319
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,720
the the iterator will move to the next

320
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,720
element right yeah

321
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,760
it's like uh

322
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,760
it's like it's like what

323
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,279
it's like mommy has money i remember i

324
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,560
give you this days of my money mommy has

325
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,959
the money five pound ten pound fifteen

326
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,000
pounds and if you come to mommy for the

327
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,000
money

328
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
the first time she will give you five

329
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,480
pounds and the second hand will be 10

330
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,120
pounds the third time with 15 right so

331
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,920
every time mommy now is the iterator

332
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,040
and

333
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,800
if you go to the mommy next next right

334
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,880
yep then mom will give you the

335
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,200
corresponding money and then she will

336
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,360
move the money so she would she will

337
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,839
have a you know pointer to points to the

338
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,000
next one if it right now if she runs out

339
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,160
of money what happened that's the second

340
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,680
parent that means the default yeah

341
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,440
default default

342
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,800
default so the first one is iterator the

343
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,279
second one is the

344
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,880
default parameter if it goes runs out

345
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,279
right so look if we want to another

346
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,720
thing we want to convert the list to the

347
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,959
list look

348
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,880
so listed to the

349
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,519
list we want to convert this to the

350
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,760
iterator we use the i i t r function

351
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,279
right i t e r

352
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,600
i t i

353
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,480
one two three four and then this will

354
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,480
give a it's basically one two three four

355
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,560
yeah it's the iterator okay with the

356
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,600
internet okay

357
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,639
yeah

358
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,600
for

359
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,639
x for x in r a r is x bigger than or

360
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,440
equal t we use this parenthesis instead

361
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,120
of this okay if we use the list

362
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,680
if we use the list we need to turn it

363
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,800
into the iterator okay wow okay that's

364
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,240
it for today

365
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,240
yes maybe

366
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,240
bye
