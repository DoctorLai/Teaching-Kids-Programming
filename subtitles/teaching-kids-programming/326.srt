1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,080
hello

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,320
hello mr hello mr ryan how are you today

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,240
good no way answering yeah

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,240
so we have sorted this yeah we have

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,679
sorted this but they might contain

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,000
duplicates

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,800
like one one two two two three four four

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,560
okay

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,680
okay so first of all three is in the

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,760
teeth okay that's why let's write salted

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,480
salted array

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,119
okay saute it away

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,760
so we have a sorted array with some

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,600
duplicates okay and we want to make

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,680
remove the

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
duplicates so we want to make it like

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,680
that you have to be

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,200
what oh yeah we want to make it work

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,160
like that

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,079
one two three four easy

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,160
okay and then whatever because look

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,559
there are two four six eight element and

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,399
there are four uniques right

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,480
one two three four and then whatever

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,480
comes after it doesn't matter

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,079
so you need to return these

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,760
what do you mean by it doesn't matter

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,119
what comes next

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:09,600
so this is an array we want to modify

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,600
the array in place what's in place

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
which means that we don't need we we

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,400
don't want to return another separate

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,360
array yeah we just want to return this

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,520
array

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,520
with all the duplicates removed

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,200
yeah so whenever you can store something

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,680
else it doesn't matter right

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,360
like you can store like 100 or whatever

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,400
it doesn't matter

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,200
so

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,439
so all i need is to remove the

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,240
duplicates from this socket remember i

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,079
started this is very important

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,040
in place so

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,159
so eventually a will become this so it's

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,560
not a separate array like b or c it's a

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,200
it's the original way and then you need

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,200
to make sure we need to make sure the

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
first

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
you know you need to tell me you need to

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,439
leave they can be also this uh you need

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,200
to tell me okay so the first four

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,439
elements stores the unique right unique

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,119
numbers in the sorted array right so you

55
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,120
need to tell me okay this is there are

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,520
four four elements here

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,879
make sense

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,440
is it clear

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,319
but you need to return the list or just

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,879
four

61
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,200
good question because this look yeah

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,840
that's a very nice question okay defy

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,840
okay so let's say remove duplicate

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,440
remove duplicate

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,000
so this is the

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,000
duplicate so this is a okay

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,680
yeah because originally i was looking

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,319
explaining where and you need to ask for

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,480
you know explanation clarification yeah

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,480
and that's what you're doing now

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,640
remove duplicate a

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,400
and then these functions

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,280
return

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,040
it return uh integer

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,159
okay so integer returns that the number

76
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,760
okay the number of the elements

77
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,239
in the

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,519
you know which content which are unique

79
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,200
right

80
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,000
yeah it's not returning at least because

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,959
we are all we are modifying the list

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
yeah

83
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,120
all right so in this case this function

84
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,120
returns four and the first four elements

85
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,760
is one two three four

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,159
easy and even now five

87
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,280
five five

88
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
so

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,519
what i need it will be five and

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,519
it doesn't matter what what's uh

91
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,599
yeah what's come after it doesn't matter

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,680
underneath you need to tell me it's five

93
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,879
this one's your return five

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,879
right make sense

95
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,640
okay

96
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,159
so

97
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,640
if

98
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,720
okay so um

99
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,519
what's your approach like what kind of

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,560
data structure can we use to store

101
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,519
we just

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,920
um

103
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,720
there's a one and then we get a next one

104
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,239
that's the same and we just delete it

105
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,040
did it and hopefully

106
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,040
yeah oh yeah

107
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,560
you can think about the most obvious way

108
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,400
of what kind of data structure you want

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
we're done set yeah we're using a set we

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,079
can use the set so first of all we use

111
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,680
the set and then these look if we use a

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,199
set one hand

113
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,479
if we use the set set a what's the a

114
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,680
this will become a set set of what

115
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,520
one two three four five unique yeah this

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,639
is only unique so the set is actually

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,639
using this curly brace

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,000
okay

119
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,199
and then now if i convert it further

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,199
convert it to list

121
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,600
actually we need to make it because that

122
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
does not have order right

123
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
set does not have order

124
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,560
so before we convert into this we need

125
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,400
to convert it to sorted using the sorted

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,479
sorted

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,639
set a

128
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,479
and then these will give me

129
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,199
what give me uh

130
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,639
40 is the iterator that you'll give me

131
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,320
uh one two three four five

132
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,759
in in ascending order because it's

133
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,320
already started

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,160
right and then i have this list

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,759
converted to list so it will become a

136
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,320
list

137
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,840
okay so this is the exactly the numbers

138
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,800
i want to return

139
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,479
right so all i have to do is copy this

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,720
over to a

141
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,960
and return the length of it right

142
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,120
all right yeah so what's the term

143
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,560
complexity if we're going for this

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,840
remember that

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,039
if we see

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,759
the salted

147
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,479
what's the term consistency

148
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,960
yeah

149
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,000
and this is the p4 origin so so

150
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,840
basically

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,320
we are not making use of the fact that

152
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,560
the array is sorted right and because we

153
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,919
somehow use a set this is all in space

154
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,400
and we

155
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,759
we use the one space to to

156
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,840
retrieve these unique right

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,120
to retrieve only one one for each

158
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,600
element even it's duplicate

159
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,319
and then we need to convert it

160
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,960
to

161
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,400
sorted okay and then this is taking o

162
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,440
and logan

163
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,520
okay so let's do this again uh let's do

164
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,919
this

165
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,479
but this is obviously not not in place

166
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,520
right this is obviously not in place

167
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,520
the multiple case a

168
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,479
okay so now look what what should i do

169
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,000
uh let's say b okay b equals

170
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,240
list

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,199
sorted

172
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,639
set you see i

173
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,400
right

174
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,360
okay

175
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
yeah

176
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,160
so

177
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,520
so what does it mean it means that first

178
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,840
of all i converted an a into a set which

179
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,520
only contains the one for each duplicate

180
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,080
number sorry one two three four five

181
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,520
right and then i i make it sorted so

182
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,000
you'll be one two three four five

183
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,680
convert that to this

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,840
and then now look

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,840
so i just need to go through this for i

186
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,759
in range

187
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,880
length b right

188
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,160
right

189
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,240
and now i just need to assign copy b to

190
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,120
a right so a i

191
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,280
equals b i right

192
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,840
and i don't i don't need to

193
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,479
change anything after a

194
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,280
after you know afterwards right so

195
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:29,560
return return

196
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,560
length of what come on

197
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,960
right

198
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,560
yeah look a is the original we want to

199
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,440
determine something

200
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,280
right makes sense

201
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,120
a is the input

202
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,160
makes sense yes

203
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
okay

204
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,879
yeah

205
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,120
this time complexity is o and of n

206
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,879
space complexities o

207
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,080
l one

208
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,080
what's the space university

209
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,720
[Music]

210
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,000
and

211
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,080
okay

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,840
yeah uh we can do better

213
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,720
yeah because we're not making use of the

214
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,440
set then this is sorted and then we we

215
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,360
are not doing this in place

216
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,160
okay so how can we do this look i i

217
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,160
write it again there

218
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,879
okay let's see so these

219
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,240
will become

220
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,320
one two three four and i don't care what

221
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,399
what's after okay

222
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,320
look look at me

223
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,039
look at me yes

224
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,440
so look look if i draw this and can you

225
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,399
make can you tell me the difference uh

226
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,919
the

227
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,200
can you tell me what

228
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,120
what's obvious here right this this one

229
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,800
two

230
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,640
three

231
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,640
four okay

232
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,839
can you tell me can you observe that

233
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,270
what

234
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,920
um um

235
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,959
[Music]

236
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,760
this one is the first one

237
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,600
the first one is quite unique yeah

238
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,480
okay so let's look at these two three

239
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,200
four

240
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,200
what are you name in common in common

241
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,880
what are those in common look

242
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,399
what are those in common the first

243
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,120
the first of what the unique number okay

244
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,200
one how come they they're unique

245
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,800
how do you know it's the first you need

246
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,200
because

247
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,839
no you just visited

248
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,000
and yes and how how do they compare to

249
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,440
the previous one um they're different

250
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
way down that's the one they are

251
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
different if they are different than the

252
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,120
previous one i put it there right

253
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
yeah look these are different than that

254
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,320
yeah it's the same look this is the same

255
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,480
so i skip

256
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,959
yeah this different right and the first

257
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,000
one is always because we always need it

258
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,839
right

259
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
yeah okay

260
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,240
so this is a beautiful algorithm

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,080
beautiful approach

262
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,839
75

263
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,760
remove

264
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,440
you dupe

265
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,440
array just a okay

266
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
so

267
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,760
um

268
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,200
so what

269
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,839
so let's say i equals one right yeah

270
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,320
i equals one

271
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:23,600
right four

272
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,399
uh let's put it maybe x x equals one for

273
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,079
i

274
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,920
in range we start from the second one

275
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,839
ah one right

276
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,320
to

277
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,040
length a

278
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,279
okay now we want to check look

279
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,360
if one

280
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,839
a i

281
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,839
not equal

282
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,760
a

283
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,200
can you tell me

284
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,680
and then what now we return what

285
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,440
we don't want can you tell me so if this

286
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,519
current element from the second animal

287
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,279
even it's different than the previous

288
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,399
one so what do we do

289
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,720
what do we do we add it

290
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,279
so how do we add it

291
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,519
how do we read it look if this this

292
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,200
element is not equal to i minus all

293
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,760
right yeah

294
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,920
now what should we do what should we do

295
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,360
first of all we need to x plus equals

296
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,360
one nine because we already found

297
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,519
another one element to put

298
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,800
and then we need to assign assign these

299
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,800
assign is what a

300
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,800
a what a x

301
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,800
actually

302
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,360
here x plus equals one a x equals

303
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,720
a i right am i right

304
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,600
make sense

305
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,600
look x is the

306
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,480
okay let me just quickly try

307
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,040
okay

308
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,480
and i want to to convert it one two

309
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,839
three four

310
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,560
right and then look

311
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,320
these here yeah

312
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,760
so x x is these x controls the progress

313
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,760
of the

314
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,519
elements we're going to put yeah x is

315
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,279
here x

316
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,320
right and a x at the beginning a x is

317
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
one

318
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,320
here

319
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,279
a x is not is put to

320
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,120
a i i a i minus one is the one we

321
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,959
already put before

322
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,240
right

323
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,240
ax equals ai

324
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,560
x plus equal and return y

325
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,240
less than one x newton x because that's

326
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,079
the final x is the number of elements in

327
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,360
the target array right

328
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,519
yes

329
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,880
what's the time complexity

330
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,880
what's the time capacity

331
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,399
right

332
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,399
what's the time

333
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,399
this is n is the number of length length

334
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,920
a right yeah going to end

335
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,920
one time which is better

336
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,800
this one on the previous one this one

337
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,320
why is that because it's quicker it's

338
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,000
quicker all right and we're doing this

339
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,399
in place and we're not using any space

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,839
what's the space convexity yeah i just

341
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,560
said we are not using any space and

342
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,560
what's the specs from chesty

343
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,760
you know what i'm talking about yeah

344
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,760
yeah

345
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,600
okay do you really understand

346
