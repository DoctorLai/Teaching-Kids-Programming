00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,839
[Music]

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,200
okay so we're going to learn some math

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,920
today uh probability okay yeah

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,320
all about probability probability what's

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,119
probability probability

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,560
okay

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:24,800
probability what's probability

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:28,000
it describes how likely an even happens

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,960
right it's just uh it's just a guess

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,440
again like it's going to rain

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,440
it probably goes into rain tomorrow

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,559
properly you know english earlier

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,800
properly

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,360
possibly which one is more likely

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,320
probably or possibly possibly

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,600
i don't know

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
in english

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,360
if you say it's going to be raining

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,200
tomorrow it's probably going to be

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,879
raining or it's possibly going to be

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,280
raining

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,719
probably it gives much probability yeah

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,840
so it's more challenging it's like

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,239
something written

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,079
yeah so probability is like it's a

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,119
number it's a fraction number between

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,400
zero to one okay you can say it's zero

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,880
you know this remember zero to one right

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,080
this means inclusive right

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,720
this means exclusive remember yeah

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,159
parentheses exclusive

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,560
square bracket

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,280
inclusive you can

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,880
we can use the numbers fraction number

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,040
between 0 and 2 1 and to to denote this

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,880
probability or we can use the

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
integer you know on the number between

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,920
zero to 100 but we put a

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,040
percentage right a hundred percent is

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,119
slow always going to happen right yeah

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,479
and tomorrow it's

42
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,079
100 it's going to rain so we know

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,799
you know tomorrow is definitely going

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,200
away yeah how do you know no i'm just

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,200
guessing

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,119
there might be something yeah yeah yeah

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,640
it's not

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,680
you know i'm just using this as an

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,280
example 100 100 right yeah so we uh so

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,920
we are going to talk about probability

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,439
today right like for example like

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,479
i give you

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,039
uh

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,120
you know let's draw a sweet box okay i

55
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,360
give you this three blocks and i tell

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,319
you that one of them

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,640
one of them has a

58
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,440
coin in that

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,000
okay yeah so what's the probability of

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,680
the first box has the coin

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,480
uh

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,879
five three um one over three yes thirty

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,519
threes over this okay

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,680
okay so now if i tell you okay so this

65
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,360
is called price price aura prior

66
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,239
how to pronounce this word priority

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,599
probability i say it's real

68
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,760
okay

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,080
it means that before the new information

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,239
is given this is the probability we know

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,879
so far that the first box

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,599
has the coin the probability is one over

73
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,519
and how about if i tell you that okay

74
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,760
if i open the second bar

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,440
and if we follow like there's no coins

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,200
so what's the probability of the first

77
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,040
coin what stock says the coin

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,920
yeah we're done because we already know

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,800
that

80
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,720
that we

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,640
the new information is given we know

82
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,280
this doesn't have a coin so

83
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,280
the coin must be in the first box or the

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,159
third box the least probability is one

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,080
over two okay a half okay yes this is

86
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,280
called posterior

87
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,760
posterior probability okay

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
probability okay probability

89
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,120
yeah makes sense

90
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,080
yeah

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,680
yeah

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
okay so now

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,440
let's say

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,000
let's say okay

95
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,000
let's say what

96
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,879
so okay so

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,879
you know the probability you can

98
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,319
multiply together okay so let's say you

99
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:54,400
have two box okay you have two box

100
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,959
right and each box has a coin but you

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,840
know the coin has two sides right yeah

102
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,920
yeah

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,159
what's the probability of both blocks

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,840
has a coin that

105
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,519
uh is both facing up

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,840
both basically what do you mean you're

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,080
not coin yeah facing up facing down

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,760
right there two sides yeah so what's the

109
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,439
probability of the

110
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,199
let's say what's the probability of

111
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,440
first the box

112
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,680
has a coin you know it has a coin what's

113
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,040
the box what's the coin what's the

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,720
probability of a coin facing up

115
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,240
uh

116
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,880
huh hour

117
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,840
what's the second box of the coin facing

118
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,080
up

119
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,840
half another half yeah what's the

120
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,120
probability of two coins facing up

121
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,199
uh

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,680
a quarter yeah that's what i mean you

123
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,759
multiply because the first one you have

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
the second one half you multiply

125
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,160
okay easy all right

126
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
now okay so remember on the first few

127
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,520
lessons we talked about van graff right

128
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,320
rain graph

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,120
yeah we can use the rain graph to to

130
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,160
study the probability okay

131
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,720
look

132
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,759
this is the event a yeah we put a big

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,240
circle

134
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,120
and this is the even b

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,720
probability here

136
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,919
what's this bit in the section what's

137
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,520
this bit

138
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,600
both a and b yeah both a and b so yeah

139
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,440
you can use you know if we using the

140
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,240
language as the set you will use these

141
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,919
yeah

142
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,919
a and b but

143
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,680
but again we can use the probability we

144
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,000
use the p right

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
yeah yeah can we look at this later okay

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,320
please

147
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,880
okay now

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,080
look what's this pa

149
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,199
what's this

150
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,880
pb

151
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,680
okay and this is p-a-b okay okay and now

152
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,919
i'm going to introduce a new mathematic

153
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,600
symbol which is called p

154
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,800
a

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,199
vertical

156
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,000
we call it conditional probability so

157
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,360
this reads as conditional probabilities

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,280
of a given b occurs

159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,680
is in the middle

160
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,360
look what what's this b

161
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,680
conditional of probability a yeah

162
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,280
given b occurs given b occurs where the

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,280
b occurs this b yeah

164
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,960
yeah given

165
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,360
b occurs probabilities of a so it's this

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,120
b yeah you know yeah okay

167
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,280
right

168
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,319
probability conditional probability of a

169
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,199
given b occurs

170
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,360
yeah so what does z equal let's say look

171
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,520
it's this bit yeah

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,880
so okay

173
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,680
so p

174
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,440
a

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
conditional probability of a given b

176
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,560
occur equals p

177
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,840
a

178
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,000
and b the meter yeah remember the meter

179
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,639
this is the numerator this is a this is

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,639
b

181
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,520
this meter yeah

182
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,199
this meter divided by the whole b right

183
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,039
so it's helping

184
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,039
okay yeah

185
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,280
okay

186
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,199
so now look this this one so we can

187
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,680
rewrite this as what p

188
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,880
a and b equals

189
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,520
p

190
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,919
a conditional probability of a given b

191
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,080
times times what

192
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,960
comes up we just rewrite this function

193
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,960
times p b right

194
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,919
yeah

195
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,080
okay

196
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,080
so what does it mean look if we swap a

197
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,160
and b what do we have is we swap a and b

198
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,039
yeah because look at the a and b are two

199
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,440
circles they are in they are you know

200
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,639
exchangeable interchangeable yeah so we

201
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,080
can write it p

202
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,960
b a equals p

203
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,319
b

204
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,080
conditional p

205
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,720
conditional probability of p given a

206
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,599
occurs times p a right

207
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,520
right

208
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,639
yeah

209
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,639
so are these two equal

210
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,440
are these two equal p a and b and p b

211
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,800
and a

212
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,919
using equal

213
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
yeah

214
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,160
yeah a and b and b and a is the same

215
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,599
yeah

216
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,759
yeah but we are going to prove this

217
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,360
later okay but now look

218
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,520
if we want to prove these two equal we

219
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,759
need to prove these two equal right

220
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,520
yeah these two equal so for now we just

221
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,680
replace this here

222
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,400
right so it equals one p conditional

223
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,639
probability of a given b equals

224
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,960
yeah substitute

225
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,400
over here okay so if p

226
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,560
b conditional probability b even a

227
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,199
times p a

228
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,680
okay so look look at this

229
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,120
look at this what do we have

230
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,759
what do we have here

231
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,719
a rectangle conditional probability of a

232
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,959
given b is equal this is yeah this is

233
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,599
equals to condition conditional

234
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,680
probability of b over given a equals

235
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,640
times probability of a divided by

236
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,159
probability b this is called

237
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,360
naive

238
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,760
what's name

239
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,760
knife

240
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,720
i probably is the name okay this

241
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,519
sounds like in a is language yeah so

242
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,320
this is the equation for this it's just

243
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,320
about calculating the positorial

244
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,320
probability yeah yeah

245
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,080
yeah based on these no one factor need

246
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,800
no probabilities

247
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,959
okay so what do we say we want to com we

248
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,399
want to compute these two if it's equal

249
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,800
okay

250
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,880
yeah we want to compute these two if

251
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,399
to see if they're equal if they're equal

252
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,640
we can substitute let's p a b with ppa

253
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,399
right and then we can put this yeah this

254
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,080
whole thing is based on if these two are

255
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,040
equal right all right

256
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,040
so let's do this

257
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,959
let's do it

258
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,480
okay so if we draw a table right i draw

259
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,920
a table

260
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,920
a draw paper come on

261
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,200
this is the event a and this is a

262
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,160
a dash for meaning the opposite of a so

263
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,800
right maybe the opposite not a okay and

264
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,800
this is b

265
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,000
oh yeah yeah yeah

266
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,800
i'm not waiting for sure but yeah it's

267
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,160
also okay exclamation mark yeah but this

268
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,040
is a dash okay let's say this is a

269
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,320
b

270
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,079
c d a c okay so what's the probability

271
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,360
what's this p a

272
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,880
b

273
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,720
times y

274
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,839
p p-a-v times p

275
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,519
b right yeah

276
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,399
what's this p a

277
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,399
given the probability of b

278
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,480
given probability of b

279
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,279
given even b and what's the probability

280
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,320
of a given b here

281
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,360
yeah

282
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,600
what's the probability of a is a

283
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,720
divided by a plus c right

284
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,480
and what's the probability of b

285
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,399
what's the probability of b look there's

286
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,959
four values what's the probability of

287
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
leaf b

288
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
look at me come on

289
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,519
what's the probability of b column given

290
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,240
there are a b a plus b plus c plus b

291
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,800
a portion of a a position c right

292
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,560
so it's a plus c

293
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,680
divided by a plus b plus c plus c okay

294
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,000
and this cancel out okay so this b a

295
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,120
condition probability of a given b times

296
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,240
b is a divided by a plus b plus c plus d

297
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,040
okay and what's the probability of p

298
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,360
b

299
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,399
conditional probability of b over a now

300
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,640
given a occurs times p a okay

301
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,160
let's take it at least look what's the

302
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,440
probability of a

303
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,040
here

304
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
the first row

305
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,920
the first row okay

306
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,560
i love b

307
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,839
so it's this b so it's a divided by a

308
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,839
plus b okay what's the probability of a

309
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
yeah

310
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,480
a plus b

311
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,480
divided by y

312
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,040
all together

313
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,399
a plus b plus c plus b

314
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,880
cancel out

315
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,760
so look a divided by a plus b plus c

316
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,279
plus z look a divided by a plus c b

317
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,920
so what does it mean

318
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,760
equal what does this mean like these two

319
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,800
equal

320
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,240
okay these two are equal okay so what do

321
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,360
we prove

322
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,800
p

323
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,639
a and b

324
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,440
equals p

325
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,440
p and a okay so we can substitute that

326
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,959
formula right

327
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
okay

328
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,519
so now

329
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,760
let's let's uh let's do a little

330
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,240
exercise okay you know the apples yeah

331
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,760
apples sometimes they're sweet sometimes

332
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,160
they're not

333
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,480
yeah apples you like apples yeah right

334
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,720
like example yummy yummy

335
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,959
okay

336
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,959
yeah

337
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,880
so i have a table yeah i have a table

338
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,920
like uh

339
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,360
color you know i i i label the colors

340
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,519
yeah like uh

341
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,760
yeah but instead i use the integer to

342
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,200
represent the color is that okay yeah

343
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,519
color

344
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,320
don't put a white or black one in there

345
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,880
why

346
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,880
what kind of effort what kind of

347
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
what possibility of the colors of the

348
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,000
apples

349
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,000
red red green green

350
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,160
just different red okay you know for the

351
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,240
red

352
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,720
very very red orange

353
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,720
okay okay

354
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,680
pinky okay

355
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,060
so let's say

356
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:35,279
we have a few values okay

357
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:37,600
[Music]

358
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,199
hey what are you looking at

359
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,199
i have my no note

360
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,680
okay so this is the existing so we

361
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,279
already have we already know there are

362
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,680
five apples

363
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,839
right two of them are sweet three of

364
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,199
them are not sweet yeah

365
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,880
yeah

366
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,199
the color the color

367
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,680
the apple with color three and weight

368
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,800
four wait you know how heavy it is let's

369
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,560
say four

370
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,880
grams okay program

371
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,480
the unit program is really light okay so

372
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,800
what's the weight of this one kilo

373
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,800
kilogram is too heavy do you have here

374
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,839
like it's like

375
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,839
yeah okay okay

376
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,920
representative okay

377
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,079
so we want to know we want to ask the

378
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,440
computer to predict that

379
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,920
color three wait three is it swedena is

380
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,240
this reasonable yes or no right remember

381
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,199
yesterday we talked about the k n n

382
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,839
right

383
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,440
k nearly neighbors right yeah

384
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,519
so if we plot

385
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,320
if we plot this number okay

386
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,959
let's let's do this with knn first okay

387
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,440
look let's put this here

388
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,079
three four if this is color this is

389
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,600
weight okay three four is here three

390
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,720
four here yeah

391
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,120
it's one

392
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,920
if it's one we use the triangle okay

393
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,519
okay

394
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,519
two three

395
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,320
two

396
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,720
three yeah triangle okay and then zero

397
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,680
three zero three

398
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,360
is just let's say a square okay

399
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,839
three two

400
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,440
three two square

401
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,760
one four

402
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,399
one four one four

403
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,440
square okay and where's the three three

404
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,360
the square should be here not that okay

405
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,560
so where's the three three

406
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,079
two three is maybe here and here right

407
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,079
okay so

408
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,680
because what's the nearest three

409
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,360
neighbors do we have nearly three

410
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,759
neighbors

411
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,320
these leaves leaves okay so

412
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,440
two yeah it's closest to two triangle

413
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,800
which means it's sweet correct

414
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,040
do you understand yeah it's really

415
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,680
useful yeah do you understand yeah

416
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,279
i don't get it why is it why is what

417
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,440
sweet look

418
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,839
this point here what's the three nearest

419
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,680
neighbor to it

420
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,560
triangle one square

421
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,240
two triangle means the sweet square

422
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,600
means not sweet

423
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,519
okay

424
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,920
so two triangles

425
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,480
two votes there are two votes which vote

426
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,639
for the apple to be sweet one vote to be

427
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,639
not sweet okay so

428
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,680
the probability of being three is higher

429
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,920
right yeah look you know this is machine

430
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,519
learning so machine make a guess you

431
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,480
know what guess it's not a hundred

432
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,120
percent accurate right yeah it's a guess

433
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,040
you ask computer to make a guess yeah

434
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,720
sometimes the guess is all right

435
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,800
sometimes it's not all right so it's

436
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,880
just the best guess so we're talking

437
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,560
about this this really being a sweet

438
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,600
apple is more likely than being not a

439
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,279
sweet pepper okay this is knf okay

440
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,759
got it

441
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,519
now we want to use this probability to

442
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,440
calculate we want to calculate the

443
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,160
probability of this apple being sweet or

444
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,720
not if okay for example if i calculate

445
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:59,519
that same p this apple being sweet is 50

446
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,759
and being not sweet is like uh

447
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,480
20 so do you think do you think this

448
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,240
airport is sweet or not sweet come on in

449
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,640
this letter i calculate somehow you know

450
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,120
it is example if this effort is

451
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,679
probability of being 3d 50

452
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:18,360
and not 3d is 30 20

453
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,360
so do you think this app is sweet or not

454
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,360
we pick the

455
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,839
sweet because yeah as i say because more

456
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,839
chance of being sweet right so now we

457
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,840
just need to calculate if this effort

458
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,440
being sweet uh if this happens being

459
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,799
nothing the probability that we compare

460
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,799
both then

461
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,200
let not be yeah

462
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,240
so how do we compute the probability of

463
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,120
apple being okay let's say p3 what's the

464
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,520
probability of least being three apple

465
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,720
two out of five

466
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,480
40 right 0.4 right

467
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,200
yeah

468
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,320
what's the probability of

469
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,400
the apple being sweet and its color

470
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,200
equals three

471
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,600
nine this is posterior probability look

472
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,280
if we already know it's three it's two

473
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,440
there are two vapors being three and

474
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,000
what's the probability of that

475
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,200
of the card effort being color three

476
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,200
among the two apples

477
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,559
there's only one difference look whoever

478
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,840
one of them is three because we already

479
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:24,080
know fifty percent yeah

480
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,840
what's the probability of the sweet

481
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,160
apple being the weight

482
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,240
equally how is that yeah so p

483
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,480
three this is weight okay this is the

484
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,039
color

485
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,039
okay so what's the probability of the

486
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,520
apple being

487
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,160
sweet also color equals three and weight

488
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,160
equals three

489
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,120
one

490
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,280
and

491
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,120
one point four one point

492
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,919
one four

493
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,160
you times all these together yeah

494
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,799
one zero point one remember the boxes

495
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,799
thing you can multiply together a half

496
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,039
times right so this is 0.4 times 0.5

497
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,400
times 0.5 right because these three we

498
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,799
can multiply together because they're

499
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,559
individual independent yeah being three

500
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,160
apple right

501
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,840
color equal three and

502
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,360
weight equals three so the probability

503
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,840
of this apple being

504
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,240
sweet is what

505
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,960
three three sweet

506
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,440
is 0.1 okay

507
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,400
now let's calculate the other side

508
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,120
all right

509
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,200
what's the probability of all the apples

510
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,039
being not sweet

511
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,760
come on we already know this is 0.5 so

512
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,760
what's the aloha

513
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,760
huh

514
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,640

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,720
three over five so what's that

516
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,840
yeah three threes what's the

517
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,799
16

518
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,200
yeah 0.6 look the other way is one minus

519
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,840
2.4 right because look we already know

520
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,600
that three apples are 40 so

521
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,320
not the sweet you know the other what's

522
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,919
what's the neck what's the rest it's 60

523
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,880
which are not sweet okay

524
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,440
and then let's say p

525
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,080
out of these three not three apples and

526
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,000
color equals three equals one

527
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,159
there are three apples here not sweet

528
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,760
and what's the color if it equals three

529
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,360
what's the probability

530
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,919
there's three what's the probability of

531
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,960
this ah

532
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,280
what three one over three i

533
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,760
what's the probability of the weight

534
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,640
equals three and not over

535
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,559
uh not sweet it's also one third right

536
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,080
so you times it together

537
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,880
what

538
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,000
0.6 times

539
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,320
one over nine so this is equals to zero

540
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,080
point zero

541
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,280
i i don't know

542
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,960
six

543
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,420
okay so it's less than zero point one so

544
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,159
what do you think is three or no

545
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,240
[Music]

546
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,880
sweet yeah because look the probability

547
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,120
is less than being nothing is less than

548
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,360
being three okay so look

549
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,559
using this probability you also make a

550
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:18,000
guess as this apple is sweet right sweet

551
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,480
okay and we use the k n and also to make

552
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,320
a guess as it's being sweet okay so the

553
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,559
chances are

554
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,919
it's sweet okay

555
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,919
make sense

556
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,120
okay so do you understand

557
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,039
yeah

558
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,679
okay so um okay so this is the

559
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,320
probability okay probability probability

560
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,640
is very useful it's very very useful

561
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,720
okay so i'm going to write this uh this

562
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,440
formula again okay

563
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,400
conditional probabilities of a given b

564
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,159
equals conditional probability of b of

565
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,960
given a occurs

566
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,840
right times p a

567
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,280
divided by p b okay that's the formula

568
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,520
let's call

569
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,120
naive

570
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,320
pairs

571
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,960
all right so you if you know these three

572
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,200
values so you can calculate these okay

573
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,240
it's very very useful

574
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,640
naive space players probability

575
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,120
equation okay we call it

576
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,440
that okay that's it for today good job

577
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,200
say bye bye

578
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,640
bye bye

579
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,640
bye bye bye bye
