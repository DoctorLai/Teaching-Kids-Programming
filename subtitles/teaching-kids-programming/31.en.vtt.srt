today we're going to talk about an
 

13
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,790
today we're going to talk about an
interesting problem chess problem and

14
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
interesting problem chess problem and
 

15
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,670
interesting problem chess problem and
we're going to use

16
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
we're going to use
 

17
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,910
we're going to use
challenge your brain yeah yeah yeah and

18
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:19,920
challenge your brain yeah yeah yeah and
 

19
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,710
challenge your brain yeah yeah yeah and
we're going to

20
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:20,720
we're going to
 

21
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,990
we're going to
use um dfs search remember we

22
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
use um dfs search remember we
 

23
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,550
use um dfs search remember we
we talked about deaf research before to

24
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
we talked about deaf research before to
 

25
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,830
we talked about deaf research before to
solve

26
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
solve
 

27
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,710
solve
to solve this problem oh it's just there

28
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
to solve this problem oh it's just there
 

29
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,109
to solve this problem oh it's just there
yeah

30
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
yeah
 

31
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,229
yeah
yeah i know come on dfs

32
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
yeah i know come on dfs
 

33
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,750
yeah i know come on dfs
it stands for what death

34
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
it stands for what death
 

35
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,590
it stands for what death
first search yeah

36
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600

 

37
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,950

death but that first you

38
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
death but that first you
 

39
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,670
death but that first you
and we're going to apply some uh

40
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
and we're going to apply some uh
 

41
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,910
and we're going to apply some uh
interesting techniques to speed up the

42
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
interesting techniques to speed up the
 

43
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,630
interesting techniques to speed up the
searches

44
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
searches
 

45
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,229
searches
and then if we we combine with the

46
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
and then if we we combine with the
 

47
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,189
and then if we we combine with the
branches to speed up yeah speed up

48
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
branches to speed up yeah speed up
 

49
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,069
branches to speed up yeah speed up
branches

50
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
branches
 

51
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,189
branches
uh branches cut off

52
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
uh branches cut off
 

53
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,310
uh branches cut off
and then you become a backtracking

54
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
and then you become a backtracking
 

55
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,310
and then you become a backtracking
aggregator so basically this is

56
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
aggregator so basically this is
 

57
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,830
aggregator so basically this is
backtracking

58
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
backtracking
 

59
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,030
backtracking
backtracking yeah yes okay so now okay

60
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
backtracking yeah yes okay so now okay
 

61
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,789
backtracking yeah yes okay so now okay
this is concept okay so this is

62
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
this is concept okay so this is
 

63
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,789
this is concept okay so this is
the problem is very simple so you you

64
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
the problem is very simple so you you
 

65
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,630
the problem is very simple so you you
know you know the chest yeah

66
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
know you know the chest yeah
 

67
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,270
know you know the chest yeah
yeah chest the size is eight times a

68
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
yeah chest the size is eight times a
 

69
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,270
yeah chest the size is eight times a
yeah eight times a square so you have

70
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
yeah eight times a square so you have
 

71
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,550
yeah eight times a square so you have
64 places to place right

72
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
64 places to place right
 

73
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,749
64 places to place right
um so a squares okay

74
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
um so a squares okay
 

75
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,429
um so a squares okay
i'm drawing the squares just roughly

76
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
i'm drawing the squares just roughly
 

77
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,350
i'm drawing the squares just roughly
okay

78
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
okay
 

79
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,190
okay
roughly how many squares are there

80
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
roughly how many squares are there
 

81
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,390
roughly how many squares are there
two four six or more two

82
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
two four six or more two
 

83
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,469
two four six or more two
four six this is your square

84
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
four six this is your square
 

85
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,069
four six this is your square
okay are they lovely okay it doesn't

86
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
okay are they lovely okay it doesn't
 

87
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,069
okay are they lovely okay it doesn't
have to be necessary let's go but

88
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
have to be necessary let's go but
 

89
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,630
have to be necessary let's go but
i'm saying now it's eight times a yeah

90
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
i'm saying now it's eight times a yeah
 

91
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,109
i'm saying now it's eight times a yeah
so if i place the queen

92
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
so if i place the queen
 

93
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,310
so if i place the queen
you know queen queen q or that queen

94
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
you know queen queen q or that queen
 

95
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,670
you know queen queen q or that queen
i i i want you to place eight

96
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
i i i want you to place eight
 

97
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,270
i i i want you to place eight
queens eight queens

98
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
queens eight queens
 

99
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,630
queens eight queens
on this ball so let no

100
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
on this ball so let no
 

101
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,430
on this ball so let no
queens no any two queens are attacking

102
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
queens no any two queens are attacking
 

103
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,110
queens no any two queens are attacking
each other so what what i mean by

104
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
each other so what what i mean by
 

105
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,030
each other so what what i mean by
attacking is that

106
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
attacking is that
 

107
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,309
attacking is that
it can't be on the same row same column

108
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
it can't be on the same row same column
 

109
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,430
it can't be on the same row same column
and same type diagonals yeah

110
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
and same type diagonals yeah
 

111
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,150
and same type diagonals yeah
yeah so these as well okay so when i

112
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
yeah so these as well okay so when i
 

113
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,070
yeah so these as well okay so when i
place the queen here

114
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
place the queen here
 

115
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,190
place the queen here
i can't place i can place

116
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
i can't place i can place
 

117
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,270
i can't place i can place
okay i probably need to use the red line

118
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
okay i probably need to use the red line
 

119
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,229
okay i probably need to use the red line
okay then

120
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
okay then
 

121
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,710
okay then
you can put it here or here yeah look at

122
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
you can put it here or here yeah look at
 

123
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,550
you can put it here or here yeah look at
this this line you can't place you can

124
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
this this line you can't place you can
 

125
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,750
this this line you can't place you can
place

126
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
place
 

127
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,390
place
you can place here you can place your

128
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
you can place here you can place your
 

129
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,229
you can place here you can place your
tangles okay

130
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
tangles okay
 

131
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,270
tangles okay
yeah you can play yeah yeah and i want

132
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
yeah you can play yeah yeah and i want
 

133
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,710
yeah you can play yeah yeah and i want
you to play

134
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
you to play
 

135
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,509
you to play
once i put it here then you can play

136
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
once i put it here then you can play
 

137
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,470
once i put it here then you can play
here

138
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
here
 

139
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,150
here
here you see you see what i mean yeah

140
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
here you see you see what i mean yeah
 

141
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,150
here you see you see what i mean yeah
okay so let's think about this problem

142
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
okay so let's think about this problem
 

143
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,750
okay so let's think about this problem
first okay it's eight queens we are

144
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
first okay it's eight queens we are
 

145
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,110
first okay it's eight queens we are
playing planes in equine

146
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
playing planes in equine
 

147
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,710
playing planes in equine
and think how many solutions we can

148
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
and think how many solutions we can
 

149
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,869
and think how many solutions we can
place on the queens on the top

150
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
place on the queens on the top
 

151
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,030
place on the queens on the top
and how about if i make it a little bit

152
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
and how about if i make it a little bit
 

153
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,149
and how about if i make it a little bit
simpler so

154
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
simpler so
 

155
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,390
simpler so
let's say you you can play on the

156
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
let's say you you can play on the
 

157
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,229
let's say you you can play on the
diagonals but not the

158
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
diagonals but not the
 

159
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,270
diagonals but not the
same columns some rows same columns and

160
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
same columns some rows same columns and
 

161
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,229
same columns some rows same columns and
some nodes

162
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
some nodes
 

163
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,430
some nodes
so how many solutions

164
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440

 

165
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,869

okay maybe yeah maybe try this uh

166
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879

 

167
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,949

uh four by four three by three

168
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
uh four by four three by three
 

169
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,509
uh four by four three by three
okay three by three okay so three by

170
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
okay three by three okay so three by

place three kings there
 

175
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,190
place three kings there
so that the loose is simpler that's even

176
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
so that the loose is simpler that's even
 

177
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,630
so that the loose is simpler that's even
harder yeah

178
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
harder yeah
 

179
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,869
harder yeah
sorry that's even harder no no no

180
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
sorry that's even harder no no no
 

181
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,390
sorry that's even harder no no no
frequency is easier

182
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
frequency is easier
 

183
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,589
frequency is easier
so because if you put it in the middle

184
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
so because if you put it in the middle
 

185
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,470
so because if you put it in the middle
you can't fit anywhere else no no no no

186
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
you can't fit anywhere else no no no no
 

187
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,630
you can't fit anywhere else no no no no
no what i mean is now we only can

188
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
no what i mean is now we only can
 

189
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,589
no what i mean is now we only can
considering the rule number one is you

190
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
considering the rule number one is you
 

191
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,710
considering the rule number one is you
can't place the

192
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
can't place the
 

193
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,830
can't place the
queen on the same line horizontal line

194
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
queen on the same line horizontal line
 

195
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,670
queen on the same line horizontal line
or vertical line it's okay to play on

196
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
or vertical line it's okay to play on
 

197
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,949
or vertical line it's okay to play on
the diagonals

198
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
the diagonals
 

199
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,350

257
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,870
oh they're all over all six do you know
how it's very easy to

258
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
how it's very easy to
 

259
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,990
how it's very easy to
to think about it so we want to we want

260
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
to think about it so we want to we want
 

261
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,710
to think about it so we want to we want
to

262
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
to
 

263
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,830
to
we want to play play three queens three

264
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
we want to play play three queens three
 

265
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,790
we want to play play three queens three
queens yeah now how many columns can we

266
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
queens yeah now how many columns can we
 

267
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,510
queens yeah now how many columns can we
place

268
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
place
 

269
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,390
place
three yeah yeah so if i place the the

270
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
three yeah yeah so if i place the the
 

271
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,510
three yeah yeah so if i place the the
first queen here

272
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
first queen here
 

273
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,270
first queen here
the second queen here the third queen

274
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
the second queen here the third queen
 

275
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,790
the second queen here the third queen
here will be simpler right

276
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
here will be simpler right
 

277
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,189
here will be simpler right
yeah so how many if i place the in the

278
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
yeah so how many if i place the in the
 

279
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,909
yeah so how many if i place the in the
first row

280
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
first row
 

281
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,029
first row
if i make a decision here how many

282
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
if i make a decision here how many
 

283
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,230
if i make a decision here how many
how many when i place the second coin

284
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
how many when i place the second coin
 

285
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,870
how many when i place the second coin
how many

286
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
how many
 

287
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,749
how many
four no when how many solutions i can

288
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
four no when how many solutions i can
 

289
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,790
four no when how many solutions i can
play for the

290
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
play for the
 

291
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,990
play for the
followers how many places can i place

292
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
followers how many places can i place
 

293
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,110
followers how many places can i place
if i place the first queen

294
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
if i place the first queen
 

295
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,230
if i place the first queen
two yes two look i pick one position

296
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
two yes two look i pick one position
 

297
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,830
two yes two look i pick one position
here then i have little two more

298
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
here then i have little two more
 

299
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,309
here then i have little two more
yeah so i pick one and then what's the

300
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
yeah so i pick one and then what's the
 

301
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,550
yeah so i pick one and then what's the
next the only one solution there yeah

302
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
next the only one solution there yeah
 

303
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,870
next the only one solution there yeah
so that the answer is three times two

304
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
so that the answer is three times two
 

305
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,550
so that the answer is three times two
right three

306
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
right three
 

307
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,110
right three
two one okay so same for this eight

308
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
two one okay so same for this eight
 

309
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,070
two one okay so same for this eight
queens it will be

310
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
queens it will be
 

311
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,189
queens it will be
a times the first first column i have

312
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
a times the first first column i have
 

313
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,830
a times the first first column i have
a personal position and after i pick the

314
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
a personal position and after i pick the
 

315
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,230
a personal position and after i pick the
first one what's the next

316
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
first one what's the next
 

317
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,670
first one what's the next
the second yeah and what's the third one

318
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
the second yeah and what's the third one
 

319
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,870
the second yeah and what's the third one
uh six and what's the fourth one five

320
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
uh six and what's the fourth one five
 

321
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,270
uh six and what's the fourth one five
four three two one so what's this what's

322
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
four three two one so what's this what's
 

323
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,350
four three two one so what's this what's
this number

324
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
this number
 

325
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,670
this number
a factor right yeah let's only apply

326
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
a factor right yeah let's only apply
 

327
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,909
a factor right yeah let's only apply
this not the horizontal and not the

328
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
this not the horizontal and not the
 

329
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,189
this not the horizontal and not the
vertical right

330
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
vertical right
 

331
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,430
vertical right
so you can have a factorial and if i

332
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
so you can have a factorial and if i
 

333
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,589
so you can have a factorial and if i
want to place the end queens on

334
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
want to place the end queens on
 

335
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,629
want to place the end queens on
on the n times and bar

336
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
on the n times and bar
 

337
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,790
on the n times and bar
how many solutions uh

338
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800

 

339
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,950

but you can still place on the diagonal

340
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
but you can still place on the diagonal
 

341
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,870
but you can still place on the diagonal
yeah okay

342
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
yeah okay
 

343
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,710
yeah okay
but if we want to consider the entire

344
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
but if we want to consider the entire
 

345
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,909
but if we want to consider the entire
note then

346
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
note then
 

347
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,309
note then
we can use the mathematics solutions to

348
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
we can use the mathematics solutions to
 

349
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,110
we can use the mathematics solutions to
to calculate

350
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
to calculate
 

351
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,110
to calculate
so how can we do this this is this is

352
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
so how can we do this this is this is
 

353
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,029
so how can we do this this is this is
more interesting yeah do you get it

354
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
more interesting yeah do you get it
 

355
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,469
more interesting yeah do you get it
do you get it now because i mean it's

356
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
do you get it now because i mean it's
 

357
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,390
do you get it now because i mean it's
great they are then

358
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
great they are then
 

359
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,790
great they are then
a square rooted than a factorial

360
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
a square rooted than a factorial
 

361
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,550
a square rooted than a factorial
um no okay oh

362
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
um no okay oh
 

363
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,150
um no okay oh
that was a perfect idea yeah it's a good

364
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
that was a perfect idea yeah it's a good
 

365
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,830
that was a perfect idea yeah it's a good
idea

366
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
idea
 

367
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,830
idea
it's a good idea but it's not perfect

368
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
it's a good idea but it's not perfect
 

369
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,510
it's a good idea but it's not perfect
enough oh okay

370
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
enough oh okay
 

371
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,230
enough oh okay
and then i need any sauce any sauce

372
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
and then i need any sauce any sauce
 

373
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,230
and then i need any sauce any sauce
count how many are they right

374
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
count how many are they right
 

375
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,190
count how many are they right
then factor it no no no no

376
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:47,200
then factor it no no no no
 

377
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,309
then factor it no no no no

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,230
up all up to
its number this is

384
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240

 

385
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,869

okay so now yeah very interesting idea

386
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
okay so now yeah very interesting idea
 

387
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,589
okay so now yeah very interesting idea
okay so

388
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
okay so
 

389
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,469
okay so
actually we asked computer how to try

390
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
actually we asked computer how to try
 

391
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,070
actually we asked computer how to try
how do we try it

392
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
how do we try it
 

393
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,150
how do we try it
so how do you try if the same look how

394
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
so how do you try if the same look how
 

395
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,710
so how do you try if the same look how
about we

396
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
about we
 

397
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,110
about we
first of all we we make sure that and

398
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
first of all we we make sure that and
 

399
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,629
first of all we we make sure that and
each queen eight queens

400
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
each queen eight queens
 

401
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,029
each queen eight queens
okay the first queen only stays here the

402
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
okay the first queen only stays here the
 

403
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,230
okay the first queen only stays here the
first column

404
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
first column
 

405
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,469
first column
the second queen second column third

406
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
the second queen second column third
 

407
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,830
the second queen second column third
queen third column

408
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
queen third column
 

409
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,670
queen third column
so in this case these eight queens

410
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
so in this case these eight queens
 

411
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,990
so in this case these eight queens
cannot be the same column right

412
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
cannot be the same column right
 

413
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,070
cannot be the same column right
yeah okay so how about if i place the

414
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
yeah okay so how about if i place the
 

415
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,149
yeah okay so how about if i place the
one queen first queen here

416
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
one queen first queen here
 

417
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,790
one queen first queen here
yeah then i want to place the second

418
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
yeah then i want to place the second
 

419
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,509
yeah then i want to place the second
queen yeah

420
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
queen yeah
 

421

previous one the first one
 

429
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,750
previous one the first one
is on the attack right can i place here

430
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
is on the attack right can i place here
 

431
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,310
is on the attack right can i place here
yes

432

437
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,990
then can i place it here yes okay okay
then i try the third queen yeah because

438
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
then i try the third queen yeah because
 

439
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,230
then i try the third queen yeah because
i can play place then i play plays on

440
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
i can play place then i play plays on
 

441
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,230
i can play place then i play plays on
the second one

442
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240

 

443
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,630

501
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,350
yeah okay so now we do the coating it
should be easy

502
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
should be easy
 

503
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,949
should be easy
why not do it yeah you take it off sorry

504
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
why not do it yeah you take it off sorry
 

505
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,750
why not do it yeah you take it off sorry
we need to take it off what i need to

506
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
we need to take it off what i need to
 

507
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,990
we need to take it off what i need to
take it oh

508
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000

what ticket pick it up take it all
 

513
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,150
what ticket pick it up take it all
what do you mean ticket over left oh

514
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
what do you mean ticket over left oh
 

515
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,030

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,230
take it
okay look look look

518
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
okay look look look
 

519
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,069
okay look look look
look come on

520
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079

 

521
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,670

look listen defy

522
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
look listen defy
 

523
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,870
look listen defy
let's defy a queen decline a queen

524
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
let's defy a queen decline a queen
 

525
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,430
let's defy a queen decline a queen
and then we take it uh n parameter which

526
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
and then we take it uh n parameter which
 

527
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,430
and then we take it uh n parameter which
is like

528
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
is like
 

529
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,389
is like
n times n solution and we want to place

530
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
n times n solution and we want to place
 

531
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,990
n times n solution and we want to place
n queens how many solutions are there

532
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
n queens how many solutions are there
 

533
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,630
n queens how many solutions are there
right

534
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
right
 

535
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,350
right
two so then now this is we need to have

536
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
two so then now this is we need to have
 

537
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,190
two so then now this is we need to have
a return this return

538
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
a return this return
 

539
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,710
a return this return
it turns out now we want to search it

540
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
it turns out now we want to search it
 

541
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,230
it turns out now we want to search it
dfs and we take the current solution

542
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
dfs and we take the current solution
 

543
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,550
dfs and we take the current solution
current solution and we have take an end

544
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
current solution and we have take an end
 

545
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,269
current solution and we have take an end
queen okay

546
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
queen okay
 

547
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,389
queen okay
now we need to define this define this

548
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
now we need to define this define this
 

549
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,110
now we need to define this define this
uh

550
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
uh
 

551
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,590
uh
define this c you are see you are

552
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
define this c you are see you are
 

553
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,509
define this c you are see you are
current current solution or maybe

554
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
current current solution or maybe
 

555
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,750
current current solution or maybe
uh let's say uh in the current solution

556
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
uh let's say uh in the current solution
 

557
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,230
uh let's say uh in the current solution
now we need to define this the df as

558
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
now we need to define this the df as
 

559
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,790
now we need to define this the df as
this

560
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
this
 

561
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,870
this
most important search now this is

562
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
most important search now this is
 

563
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,150
most important search now this is
current solution

564
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
current solution
 

565
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,470
current solution
and we want to place the aqueous end

566
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
and we want to place the aqueous end
 

567
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,670
and we want to place the aqueous end
queens yeah

568
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
queens yeah
 

569
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,790
queens yeah
right yes now current solution is the

570
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
right yes now current solution is the
 

571
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,470
right yes now current solution is the
number of rows so if

572
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
number of rows so if
 

573
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,030
number of rows so if
for example if it's empty it means that

574
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
for example if it's empty it means that
 

575
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,630
for example if it's empty it means that
we haven't placed any

576
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
we haven't placed any
 

577
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,750
we haven't placed any
queens yet and if it's like zero it

578
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
queens yet and if it's like zero it
 

579
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,430
queens yet and if it's like zero it
means i want to place the

580
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
means i want to place the
 

581
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,629
means i want to place the
only i only place one queen so far yeah

582
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
only i only place one queen so far yeah
 

583
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,670
only i only place one queen so far yeah
which is on the first first zero yeah

584
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
which is on the first first zero yeah
 

585
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,310
which is on the first first zero yeah
this is zero this is one okay so i'm

586
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
this is zero this is one okay so i'm
 

587
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,790
this is zero this is one okay so i'm
going to check this

588
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
going to check this
 

589
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,550
going to check this
yeah it's okay okay no

590
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
yeah it's okay okay no
 

591
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,590
yeah it's okay okay no
no so look

592
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
no so look
 

593
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,710
no so look
uh wow so look look listen

594
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
uh wow so look look listen
 

595
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,829
uh wow so look look listen
so now if i have this zero

596
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
so now if i have this zero
 

597
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,030
so now if i have this zero
zero zero and maybe this two

598
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
zero zero and maybe this two
 

599
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,990
zero zero and maybe this two
okay so what does it mean zero two it

600
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,000
okay so what does it mean zero two it
 

601
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,110
okay so what does it mean zero two it
means that uh

602
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
means that uh
 

603
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,750
means that uh
i have placed two queens the first one

604
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:21,760
i have placed two queens the first one
 

605
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,829
i have placed two queens the first one
in the one

606
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
in the one
 

607
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,230
in the one
um what does it mean

608
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
um what does it mean
 

609
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,870
um what does it mean
this is the first queen yeah yeah this

610
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
this is the first queen yeah yeah this
 

611
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,910
this is the first queen yeah yeah this
is the second queen

612
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
is the second queen
 

613
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,550
is the second queen
the first queen is from zero so this is

614
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
the first queen is from zero so this is
 

615
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,190
the first queen is from zero so this is
yellow

616
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
yellow
 

617
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,470
yellow
this is one zero okay two

618
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
this is one zero okay two
 

619
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,870
this is one zero okay two
is what this is yellow one two two is

620
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
is what this is yellow one two two is
 

621
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,829
is what this is yellow one two two is
here do we get it

622
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
here do we get it
 

623
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,030
here do we get it
where's one i can't place on the one

624
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
where's one i can't place on the one
 

625
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,470
where's one i can't place on the one
because one and zero will be diagonal

626
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
because one and zero will be diagonal
 

627
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,110
because one and zero will be diagonal
attack yeah okay so that's what it means

628
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
attack yeah okay so that's what it means
 

629
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,670
attack yeah okay so that's what it means
okay now

630
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
okay now
 

631
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,710
okay now
we have a current now we have current

632
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
we have a current now we have current
 

633
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,269
we have a current now we have current
right

634
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
right
 

635
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,710
right
so we have to check if right right look

636
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
so we have to check if right right look
 

637
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,389
so we have to check if right right look
if car if the length of the current

638
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
if car if the length of the current
 

639
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,269
if car if the length of the current
we need to be just is n what does it

640
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
we need to be just is n what does it
 

641
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:03,829
we need to be just is n what does it
mean

642
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
mean
 

643
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,310
mean
if we we already placed n queens what do

644
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
if we we already placed n queens what do
 

645
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,470
if we we already placed n queens what do
you mean we found a solution right yes

646
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
you mean we found a solution right yes
 

647
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,790
you mean we found a solution right yes
then we need to return one yeah return

648
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
then we need to return one yeah return
 

649
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,750
then we need to return one yeah return
this now

650
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
this now
 

651
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,629
this now
the answer is one yeah okay yeah because

652
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
the answer is one yeah okay yeah because
 

653
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,829
the answer is one yeah okay yeah because
we already placed that

654
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
we already placed that
 

655
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,310
we already placed that
yeah now now we need to check what

656
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
yeah now now we need to check what
 

657
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,670
yeah now now we need to check what
four we have this answer yeah answer

658
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
four we have this answer yeah answer
 

659
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,550
four we have this answer yeah answer
equals zero it's

660
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
equals zero it's
 

661
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,030
equals zero it's
gonna take forever no no no come on

662
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
gonna take forever no no no come on
 

663
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,790
gonna take forever no no no come on
listen it's very interesting now

664
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
listen it's very interesting now
 

665
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,150
listen it's very interesting now
look for for now i want to place the row

666

i can have n so n places for the row
 

673
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,829
i can have n so n places for the row
yeah from from zero one to n plus i

674
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
yeah from from zero one to n plus i
 

675
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,110
yeah from from zero one to n plus i
minus one right

676
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120
minus one right
 

677
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,230

but i need to check if i can place place
 

729
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,910
but i need to check if i can place place
on this location if it then

730
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
on this location if it then
 

731
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,790
on this location if it then
place then i can place on the next slope

732
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
place then i can place on the next slope
 

733
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,550
place then i can place on the next slope
and next screen yeah

734
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
and next screen yeah
 

735
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,710
and next screen yeah
when i place here then i can place next

736
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
when i place here then i can place next
 

737
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,829
when i place here then i can place next
one okay

738

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,389
yeah yeah so now we just need to
implement the complaints

750
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
implement the complaints
 

751
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:16,310
implement the complaints
okay you need a print but that's

759
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,949

so look uh for i

760
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:32,959
so look uh for i
 

761
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,069
so look uh for i
y in

762
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079

 

763
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,470

right denominator okay what's this what

764
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
right denominator okay what's this what
 

765
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,269
right denominator okay what's this what
enumerate i will talk about it

766
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
enumerate i will talk about it
 

767
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,470

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,480

 

769
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,910

if y equals equals x yeah because

770
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:49,920
if y equals equals x yeah because
 

771
00:15:49,920 --> 00:16:04,690
if y equals equals x yeah because
what does it mean it means

772
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:04,700

current minus i equals

776
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
current minus i equals
 

777
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,430
current minus i equals
abs abs x g of plus y

778
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
abs abs x g of plus y
 

779
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,670
abs abs x g of plus y
and minus one and then we do ten fourths

780
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
and minus one and then we do ten fourths
 

781
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,710
and minus one and then we do ten fourths
abs

782
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
abs
 

783
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:29,030
abs
right then as

784
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040

 

785
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,230

okay so abs absolute value

786
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
okay so abs absolute value
 

787
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,949
okay so abs absolute value
so let's see what's the abs that abs

788
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
so let's see what's the abs that abs
 

789
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:35,509
so let's see what's the abs that abs
from here

790
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
from here
 

791
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,790
from here
okay abs three

792
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
okay abs three
 

793
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,990
okay abs three
equals three abs minus three

794
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
equals three abs minus three
 

795
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,230
equals three abs minus three
equals three can you get the meaning

796
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240

 

797
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,269

what does abs mean so abs is absolute

798
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:51,279
what does abs mean so abs is absolute
 

799
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,069
what does abs mean so abs is absolute
value so

800
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
value so
 

801
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,230
value so
meaning that look this is the number

802
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
meaning that look this is the number
 

803
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,350
meaning that look this is the number
yeah this is zero here right

804
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
yeah this is zero here right
 

805
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,540
yeah this is zero here right
one two three four five times

806
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:00,550

so this number abx x is the distance

810
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,640
so this number abx x is the distance
 

811
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,669
so this number abx x is the distance
between x and zero okay

812
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
between x and zero okay
 

813
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,909
between x and zero okay
so what does it mean is the distance

814
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
so what does it mean is the distance
 

815
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,510
so what does it mean is the distance
so if it's the positive number abx

816
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
so if it's the positive number abx
 

817
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,270
so if it's the positive number abx
x equals x if x equals bigger than zero

818
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
x equals x if x equals bigger than zero
 

819
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,150
x equals x if x equals bigger than zero
right

820
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
right
 

821
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,630
right
yeah if it's smaller than zero what does

822
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
yeah if it's smaller than zero what does
 

823
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,150
yeah if it's smaller than zero what does
it mean abs

824
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
it mean abs
 

825
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,270
it mean abs
x equals minus x right look

826
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
x equals minus x right look
 

827
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,750
x equals minus x right look
minus three how many units distance

828
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
minus three how many units distance
 

829
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,310
minus three how many units distance
three

830
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,320
three
 

831
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,430
three
three okay so abs is like that abs

832
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
three okay so abs is like that abs
 

833
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,310
three okay so abs is like that abs
minus two thousand equals one two

834
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,320
minus two thousand equals one two
 

835
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,029
minus two thousand equals one two
thousand

836
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:39,039
thousand
 

837
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,630
thousand
abs um one million one million

838
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
abs um one million one million
 

839
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,150
abs um one million one million
abs minus ten trillion

840
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
abs minus ten trillion
 

841
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,830
abs minus ten trillion
yeah you got it yeah okay okay so now

842
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
yeah you got it yeah okay okay so now
 

843
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,430
yeah you got it yeah okay okay so now
look this is these we know right

844
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
look this is these we know right
 

845
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,870
look this is these we know right
we this is to check we can't place the

846
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
we this is to check we can't place the
 

847
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,150
we this is to check we can't place the
the queen on the previous row right yeah

848
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
the queen on the previous row right yeah
 

849
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,630
the queen on the previous row right yeah
if i

850
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
if i
 

851
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,190
if i
if i place the first queen on the two i

852
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
if i place the first queen on the two i
 

853
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,190
if i place the first queen on the two i
can't place the current king in the two

854
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,200
can't place the current king in the two
 

855
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,430
can't place the current king in the two
right and this is to check the diagonals

856
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
right and this is to check the diagonals
 

857
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,350
right and this is to check the diagonals
so look what how do you calculate that

858
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
so look what how do you calculate that
 

859
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,470
so look what how do you calculate that
look like if the first one is two

860
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
look like if the first one is two
 

861
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,950
look like if the first one is two
the second one the first one is two

862
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
the second one the first one is two
 

863
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,669
the second one the first one is two
second one

864
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
second one
 

865
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,789
second one
is three it comes right because the tip

866
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
is three it comes right because the tip
 

867
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,310
is three it comes right because the tip
the horizontal difference is is what

868
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,320
the horizontal difference is is what
 

869
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,510
the horizontal difference is is what
is length current minus

870
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
is length current minus
 

871
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,750
is length current minus
i i i will talk about it later it's from

872
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
i i i will talk about it later it's from
 

873
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,830
i i i will talk about it later it's from
zero to one two three four to

874
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
zero to one two three four to
 

875
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,990
zero to one two three four to
n and then what did i talk about

876
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
n and then what did i talk about
 

877
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,230
n and then what did i talk about
the behavior on the lessons would be

878
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
the behavior on the lessons would be
 

879
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,270
the behavior on the lessons would be
good okay

880
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,280
good okay
 

881
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,909
good okay
and then this abs x minus one is just

882
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
and then this abs x minus one is just
 

883
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:44,470
and then this abs x minus one is just
the value

884
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
the value
 

885
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,029
the value
yeah if you if you place three minus two

886
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
yeah if you if you place three minus two
 

887
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,230
yeah if you if you place three minus two
values

888
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
values
 

889
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,909
values
it's the value uh this is a bit

890
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
it's the value uh this is a bit
 

891
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,029
it's the value uh this is a bit
tricky okay look i'm gonna write it

892
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
tricky okay look i'm gonna write it
 

893
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,070
tricky okay look i'm gonna write it
again

894
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
again
 

895
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,190
again
wow

896
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200

 

897
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,230

again and again

898
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240

 

899
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,590

look current okay u

900
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
look current okay u
 

901
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,789
look current okay u
equals the 1 three five

902
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799
equals the 1 three five
 

903
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,150
equals the 1 three five
seven nine four okay okay if this is

904
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
seven nine four okay okay if this is
 

905
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,190
seven nine four okay okay if this is
current yeah

906
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
current yeah
 

907
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,750
current yeah
so what does it mean by if i do this for

908
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
so what does it mean by if i do this for
 

909
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:34,310
so what does it mean by if i do this for
i y in

910
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320

 

911
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,830

current so what does it do when if i

912
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
current so what does it do when if i
 

913
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,990
current so what does it do when if i
point

914
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
point
 

915
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,669
point
if i print i and y what what can we get

916
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
if i print i and y what what can we get
 

917
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,710
if i print i and y what what can we get
look at this one three

918
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
look at this one three
 

919
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,630
look at this one three
five two four and then here this is the

920
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:48,640
five two four and then here this is the
 

921
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,190
five two four and then here this is the
y value y value will be one three five

922
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
y value y value will be one three five
 

923
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,870
y value y value will be one three five
two four yeah one three five two four

two four yeah one three five two four
 

925
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,310
two four yeah one three five two four
this is the y value yeah

926
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,320
this is the y value yeah
 

927
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,669
this is the y value yeah
yeah i value will be what i value will

928
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
yeah i value will be what i value will
 

929
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,070
yeah i value will be what i value will
be

930
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,080
be
 

931
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,190
be
zero one two three four easy it just

932
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
zero one two three four easy it just
 

933
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,870
zero one two three four easy it just
give a number from zero

934
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880
give a number from zero
 

935
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,149
give a number from zero
right why we don't need to do that i

936
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:06,159
right why we don't need to do that i
 

937
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,630
right why we don't need to do that i
now we need to we can know which column

938
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
now we need to we can know which column
 

939
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,590
now we need to we can know which column
is it

940
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
is it
 

941
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,630
is it
right yes this will be column i i

942
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
right yes this will be column i i
 

943
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,470
right yes this will be column i i
if i can rename it as column column y

944
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:16,480
if i can rename it as column column y
 

945
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,029
if i can rename it as column column y
column okay so now we just need to check

946
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:21,039
column okay so now we just need to check
 

947
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,789
column okay so now we just need to check
so now look look one three five two four

948
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
so now look look one three five two four
 

949
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,350
so now look look one three five two four
okay let's see

950
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,360
okay let's see
 

951
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,630
okay let's see
why five sorry five by five

952
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
why five sorry five by five
 

953
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,789
why five sorry five by five
that's okay how about you for just one

954
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
that's okay how about you for just one
 

955
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,310
that's okay how about you for just one
three one three here

956
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
three one three here
 

957
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,350
three one three here
one two three yeah now

958
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
one two three yeah now
 

959
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,830
one two three yeah now
i want to check if the diagonal right if

960
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:39,840
i want to check if the diagonal right if
 

961
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,750
i want to check if the diagonal right if
i place here

962
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:41,760
i place here
 

963
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,950
i place here
i place here this is zero right that's

964
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
i place here this is zero right that's
 

965
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,510
i place here this is zero right that's
fine

966
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
fine
 

967
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,750
fine
that's fine look what is right i need to

968
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,760
that's fine look what is right i need to
 

969
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,870
that's fine look what is right i need to
check now it will be

970
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
check now it will be
 

971
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,310
check now it will be
0 1 and 1 3 yeah 1 3 and then i need to

972
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
0 1 and 1 3 yeah 1 3 and then i need to
 

973
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,029
0 1 and 1 3 yeah 1 3 and then i need to
check if

974
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039

 

975
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,230

0 plus 0 minus 1 abs

976
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:00,240
0 plus 0 minus 1 abs
 

977
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,630
0 plus 0 minus 1 abs
is it equals to is equals to what

978
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640

 

979
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,630

is it equals to zero and what is equals

980
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
is it equals to zero and what is equals
 

981
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:10,950
is it equals to zero and what is equals
to

982
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
to
 

983
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,630
to
this is second this is zero so this

984
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
this is second this is zero so this
 

985
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,990
this is second this is zero so this
two minus zero it's not equal right

986
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
two minus zero it's not equal right
 

987
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,630
two minus zero it's not equal right
right it's not equal if it's equal what

988
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
right it's not equal if it's equal what
 

989
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,430
right it's not equal if it's equal what
does it mean

990
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,440
does it mean
 

991
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,549
does it mean
if it's equal if i put it here zero one

992
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
if it's equal if i put it here zero one
 

993
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,710
if it's equal if i put it here zero one
two three yeah yeah

994
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720

 

995
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,789

it because the first one and the third

996
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:30,799
it because the first one and the third
 

997
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,149
it because the first one and the third
one

998
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
one
 

999
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,990
one
is on the diagonal so what can we get

1000
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,000
is on the diagonal so what can we get
 

1001
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,350
is on the diagonal so what can we get
three minus one

1002
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,360
three minus one
 

1003
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,270
three minus one
the value minus it yeah the value

1004
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,280
the value minus it yeah the value
 

1005
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,870
the value minus it yeah the value
yeah is two but now

1006
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:42,880
yeah is two but now
 

1007
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,870
yeah is two but now
this is the second column this is the

1008
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
this is the second column this is the
 

1009
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,549
this is the second column this is the
yellow column

1010
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
yellow column
 

1011
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,149
yellow column
two minus zero equals two y so so look

1012
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:50,159
two minus zero equals two y so so look
 

1013
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,870
two minus zero equals two y so so look
yeah it's equal it means that we cannot

1014
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
yeah it's equal it means that we cannot
 

1015
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,510
yeah it's equal it means that we cannot
place

1016
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,520
place
 

1017
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,789
place
do you get it yeah this is basically how

1018
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:56,799
do you get it yeah this is basically how
 

1019
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,990
do you get it yeah this is basically how
we check these basically we check

1020
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,000
we check these basically we check
 

1021
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,350
we check these basically we check
these distance this distance

1022
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
these distance this distance
 

1023
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,470
these distance this distance
and the least distance yeah

1024
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
and the least distance yeah
 

1025
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,190
and the least distance yeah
if this distance equals this descent

1026
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
if this distance equals this descent
 

1027
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,270
if this distance equals this descent
what does it mean

1028
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
what does it mean
 

1029
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,270
what does it mean
if it's if it is if this is the square

1030
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,280
if it's if it is if this is the square
 

1031
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,350
if it's if it is if this is the square
if this is a square it means it's on the

1032
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
if this is a square it means it's on the
 

1033
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,789
if this is a square it means it's on the
diagonal right

1034
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
diagonal right
 

1035
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,110
diagonal right
yeah basically we're just checking that

1036
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
yeah basically we're just checking that
 

1037
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,590
yeah basically we're just checking that
okay so if you run this solution

1038
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
okay so if you run this solution
 

1039
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,310
okay so if you run this solution
you can find out the total number of

1040
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,320
you can find out the total number of
 

1041
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,669
you can find out the total number of
solutions to place

1042
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
solutions to place
 

1043
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,710
solutions to place
on the a times a

1044
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,720
on the a times a
 

1045
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,350
on the a times a
queen with a queens yeah eight times a

1046
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
queen with a queens yeah eight times a
 

1047
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,750
queen with a queens yeah eight times a
ball

1048
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:33,760
ball
 

1049
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,029
ball
chess ball with the a queen is 92.

1050
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
chess ball with the a queen is 92.
 

1051
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,070
chess ball with the a queen is 92.
got it okay do you get it

1052
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,080
got it okay do you get it
 

1053
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,390
got it okay do you get it
so let the answer the the process how do

1054
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,400
so let the answer the the process how do
 

1055
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,310
so let the answer the the process how do
we do it so place the first screen

1056
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
we do it so place the first screen
 

1057
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,070
we do it so place the first screen
we if we can place on the first screen

1058
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
we if we can place on the first screen
 

1059
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,990
we if we can place on the first screen
we try the next screen

1060
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
we try the next screen
 

1061
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,990
we try the next screen
yeah if we can try next screen we try

1062
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
yeah if we can try next screen we try
 

1063
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,190
yeah if we can try next screen we try
next swing again

1064
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,200
next swing again
 

1065
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,070
next swing again
and until we get we place the whole end

1066
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
and until we get we place the whole end
 

1067
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,950
and until we get we place the whole end
queens

1068
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
queens
 

1069
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,390
queens
and after that after that we added

1070
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
and after that after that we added
 

1071
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,789
and after that after that we added
the answer we found the solution right

1072
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799
the answer we found the solution right
 

1073
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,549
the answer we found the solution right
because this is recursion yeah because

1074
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
because this is recursion yeah because
 

1075
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,430
because this is recursion yeah because
you so you

1076
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:03,440
you so you
 

1077
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,750
you so you
keep trying the the first screen i put

1078
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760
keep trying the the first screen i put
 

1079
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,830
keep trying the the first screen i put
the first one second one third one until

1080
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:07,840
the first one second one third one until
 

1081
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,789
the first one second one third one until
eighth one

1082
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
eighth one
 

1083
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,149
eighth one
and when i search all of these solutions

1084
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,159
and when i search all of these solutions
 

1085
