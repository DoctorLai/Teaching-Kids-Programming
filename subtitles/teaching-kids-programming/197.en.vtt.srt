00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
how are you today good yeah okay so
 

7
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,190
how are you today good yeah okay so
today we'll talk about the binary tree

8
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,200
today we'll talk about the binary tree
 

9
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,950
today we'll talk about the binary tree
again okay by the tree

10
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:10,960
again okay by the tree
 

11
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,430
again okay by the tree
the numbers nose all right so finally

12
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
the numbers nose all right so finally
 

13
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,430
the numbers nose all right so finally
what's fine we mean

14
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
what's fine we mean
 

15
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,710
what's fine we mean
two okay so if i have these notes

16
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
two okay so if i have these notes
 

17
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,310
two okay so if i have these notes
a loot doesn't have any parents

18
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
a loot doesn't have any parents
 

19
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,589
a loot doesn't have any parents
and any notes it can have left or right

20
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
and any notes it can have left or right
 

21
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,189
and any notes it can have left or right
you have maximum two kids right

22
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:29,199
you have maximum two kids right
 

23
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,310
you have maximum two kids right
and then the leaf doesn't have any kids

24
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
and then the leaf doesn't have any kids
 

25
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,510
and then the leaf doesn't have any kids
so if

26
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
so if
 

27
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,630
so if
if the if we say that the left triad

28
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
if the if we say that the left triad
 

29
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,590
if the if we say that the left triad
is angular 45 degree and the right tries

30
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
is angular 45 degree and the right tries
 

31
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:41,910
is angular 45 degree and the right tries
and

32
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920
and
 

33
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,869
and
45 degree to the right so we want to

34
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
45 degree to the right so we want to
 

35
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,670
45 degree to the right so we want to
find out how many lines vertical lines

36
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
find out how many lines vertical lines
 

37
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,189
find out how many lines vertical lines
are these you know the minimum number of

38
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
are these you know the minimum number of
 

39
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,189
are these you know the minimum number of
vertical lines that

40
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
vertical lines that
 

41
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,950
vertical lines that
cross all those notes for example this

42
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
cross all those notes for example this
 

43
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,029
cross all those notes for example this
one it will cross 1

44
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039
one it will cross 1
 

45
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,150
one it will cross 1
two three four okay

46
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
two three four okay
 

47
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,349
two three four okay
so look these these and

48
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
so look these these and
 

49
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,630
so look these these and
the loot and is the same line on the

50
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:06,640
the loot and is the same line on the
 

51
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,789
the loot and is the same line on the
slice on the center of the root of right

52
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
slice on the center of the root of right
 

53
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,109
slice on the center of the root of right
or left okay and also root on left or

54
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
or left okay and also root on left or
 

55
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:11,750

right
 

57
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,270
right
if i have another note here like five

58
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
if i have another note here like five
 

59
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,789
if i have another note here like five
okay okay so we want to know that

60
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
okay okay so we want to know that

sideways breakfast sideways so what do

122
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
sideways breakfast sideways so what do
 

123
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,430
sideways breakfast sideways so what do
you mean sideways

124
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440

 

125
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,949

turn it around turn it around

turn it around turn it around
 

127
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,470
turn it around turn it around
how so

128
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480

 

129
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,070

what determines the number of the lines

130
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
what determines the number of the lines
 

131
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,110
what determines the number of the lines
they're all 45 degrees yeah if we i if

132
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
they're all 45 degrees yeah if we i if
 

133
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,350
they're all 45 degrees yeah if we i if
i said this if the loot is and the

134
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
i said this if the loot is and the
 

135
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,390
i said this if the loot is and the
horizontal

136
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
horizontal
 

137
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,750
horizontal
zero can i delete the offset

138
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
zero can i delete the offset
 

139
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,550
zero can i delete the offset
and if i go to the left what happens

140
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
and if i go to the left what happens
 

141
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,670
and if i go to the left what happens
minus

142
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
minus
 

143
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,949
minus
minus one if i go to the right one

144
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
minus one if i go to the right one
 

145
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,750
minus one if i go to the right one
yeah yeah you see three total ones yeah

146
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
yeah yeah you see three total ones yeah
 

147
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,309
yeah yeah you see three total ones yeah
i go another one that would be mine

148
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
i go another one that would be mine
 

149
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,270
i go another one that would be mine
right there yeah two yeah or two okay

150
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
right there yeah two yeah or two okay
 

151
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,350
right there yeah two yeah or two okay
so when we go to the left we

152
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
so when we go to the left we
 

153
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,789
so when we go to the left we
push the kids and the

154
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
push the kids and the
 

155
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,309
push the kids and the
the horizontal offset right minus one

156
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
the horizontal offset right minus one
 

157
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,229
the horizontal offset right minus one
and i'll go to the right we push the kit

158
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
and i'll go to the right we push the kit
 

159
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,190
and i'll go to the right we push the kit
and then increment the horizontal offset

160
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
and then increment the horizontal offset
 

161
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,550
and then increment the horizontal offset
and in order to keep to count how many

162
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
and in order to keep to count how many
 

163
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,910
and in order to keep to count how many
how many offsets in the unique

164
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
how many offsets in the unique
 

165
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,110
how many offsets in the unique
i mean how many unique offsets uh

166
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
i mean how many unique offsets uh
 

167
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,110
i mean how many unique offsets uh
where should we what kind of data

168
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
where should we what kind of data
 

169
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,470
where should we what kind of data
structure are we using

170
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
structure are we using
 

171
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,830

to store the unique elements

172
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
to store the unique elements
 

173
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,590

the offset what happens on the offset
what's that offset one

286
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
what's that offset one
 

287
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,350
what's that offset one
go to the left what happened to the

288
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
go to the left what happened to the
 

289
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:17,189
go to the left what happened to the
offset minus

290
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199

 

291
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,550

we go to the right we plus one and

292
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
we go to the right we plus one and
 

293
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,830
we go to the right we plus one and
return what we return return the number

294
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
return what we return return the number
 

295
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,510
return what we return return the number

296
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
of the elements in the set so what
 

297
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,070
of the elements in the set so what
should i do

298
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
should i do
 

299
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,800
should i do
here

300

count how many numbers in that so what

306
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
count how many numbers in that so what
 

307
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,309
count how many numbers in that so what
what's the function to call length

308
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
what's the function to call length
 

309
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,070
what's the function to call length
data data

310

data data
 

311
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,469
data data
you see that's it so if current the left

312
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
you see that's it so if current the left
 

313
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,749
you see that's it so if current the left
we push it to the left

314
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
we push it to the left
 

315
