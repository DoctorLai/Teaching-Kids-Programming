1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,040
go hello

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,920
hello mr mr ryan how are you today good

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,200
okay

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,679
because we have a very great superhero

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,759
okay so today we talk about uh you know

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,640
the

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,640
linear equation linear equation

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,439
linear equation okay so what's linear

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,119
linear

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,240
one unknown even linear equation in

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,240
one unknown

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,360
one unknown for example three times

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,200
three times x

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,719
plus

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,600
three equals six this is one linear

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,600
equation with one unknown right linear

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,239
means the unknown here

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,480
yeah it's only one time linear minor

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,360
yeah remember this linear

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,360
linear single yeah nothing

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,600
all right x

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,760
what's what's causative if it's even

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,320
here it's two it's graduated from here

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,680
remember this is non-linear right or

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,960
cubic

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,479
right so this x to the power of one is

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,040
indeed linear x to the power of 2

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,280
this is projected and x to the power of

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,960
3 that's cubic you know you can have

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,080
more right as long as this unknown has

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,920
one which is x we call it linear linear

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,960
equation and there's only one equa one

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,720
another one here x so what's x here

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,560
what's the value of x three times

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,960
something plus three equals six so

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,799
what's this x can you make a guess

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,439
three times something

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,960
plus three one yeah we're done okay so

39
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,720
how how do we solve this easy we move

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,000
this constant to the right hand side and

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,280
change the sign

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,280
minus three

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,560
so three times x equals three and then

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,520
we can divide it three from both sides

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,479
right so we we got it

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,680
yeah we got it so we go to x equals

47
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,680
one okay easy

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,520
quadratic yeah a x squared plus b bx

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,160
plus c equals zero remember we talked

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,959
about this graduated because this is

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,000
2 2 times 2 x to the power of 2

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,520
a b c are constant and then look we got

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,280
one unknown unknown right on a linear

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,280
equation in two unknowns

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,560
so if we have two unknowns and then if

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,480
we we with one unknown we can have one

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,400
equation and we know how to solve it

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,319
with two unknowns how many questions do

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,319
we need

60
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,660
can we

61
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,360
sorry

62
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,959
[Music]

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,840
one equation solves one unknown right

64
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,800
yes

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,000
can we solve two equations two can we

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,319
solve two unknowns with one equation

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,800
yeah for example a plus b equals ten

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,400
can you solve this a can you solve this

69
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
no because look a and b could be

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,720
hundreds of you know millions of

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,680
possibilities a equals one b equals 9 a

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,360
equals to b equals 8 right

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,239
however if i say a minus b

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,239
equals

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,280
okay four

76
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,120
what are ifs

77
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,120
uh it's gonna be uh

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,319
so look we have two unknowns okay

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,760
it's gonna be uh

80
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,159
it's gonna it's

81
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,319
gonna be can you try it three and seven

82
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,519
where down three and seven look two

83
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,680
unknowns two equations we can solve it

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,920
yeah yeah yeah so let's let's linear

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,440
equation in two unknowns so how can we

86
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,239
solve this how do you know it's three

87
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,040
and uh seven and three it's just guess

88
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,879
blue four thing something yeah yeah

89
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,040
one one one trick look plus b minus b

90
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,799
look

91
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,879
how about look because look these

92
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,799
how about if we add the left side and

93
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,560
add the right side together

94
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,319
ten plus four right

95
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,360
fourteen

96
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:15,599
a plus b plus a minus b

97
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,400
fourteen two a 2a oh sorry so what's a

98
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,840
seven yeah and if a is seven then we can

99
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,520
just plug in the values that would be

100
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,400
three yeah easy huh

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,400
yeah two

102
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,880
for anymore

103
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,720
a seven and b u b is three right three

104
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,360
plus seven eight so why don't they need

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,840
to be seven because look a plus b equals

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,919
ten a minus b equals four it needs to

107
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,199
satisfy these two equations that's what

108
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,919
i'm saying

109
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:48,160
two unknowns needs two equations to to

110
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,160
to be able to be uh solvable right

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,600
okay so

112
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,160
if you know how to solve this linear

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,639
equation into unknowns that we can solve

114
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,199
many many applications like like rugby

115
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,400
and chicken chicken rabbit problem right

116
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,360
right

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,400
home

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,400
repeat and chicken

119
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,240
yeah if i have uh

120
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,199
you know look if i have a cage right i

121
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,360
have a cage and there are some chickens

122
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,120
some chicken i don't know how many i

123
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,639
know some rabbit

124
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,880
yeah

125
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,880
some rabbit

126
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,280
okay so listen to me

127
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,360
i have some chicken and how about if i

128
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,199
tell you that they are

129
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,120
okay listen to me okay

130
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:42,880
okay no no no no no what's that okay

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,120
okay listen if if they are

132
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,360
they are eleven heads

133
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,400
eleven heads

134
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,440
okay you know my head listen okay and

135
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,080
how many legs does the rabbit have four

136
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,520
four legs so already has four legs right

137
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,360
four legs how many chickens does that

138
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,360
how many chickens are there

139
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,840
how many legs does the chicken have

140
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,520
two two

141
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,400
legs okay why are you talking about legs

142
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,560
and talking about heads

143
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,199
so all i know is that there are some

144
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,520
chickens and rabbits in the cage

145
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,600
and they're all over all 11

146
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,240
pets including the chicken and rabbit

147
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,919
and they are why why

148
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,080
why are you talking about legs and then

149
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,919
suddenly talking about heads

150
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,680
because it needs two equations to solve

151
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,639
it okay so look r plus c equals 11 right

152
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,039
okay

153
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,039
i'm

154
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,680
that's what i'm saying okay so let's say

155
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
if if they are

156
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,000
okay

157
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,440
if they are what if they are 32 legs

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,240
so 32 legs together so how many 32 legs

159
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:03,560
all together and how many rabbits how

160
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,560
many chickens so look for legs

161
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,200
[Music]

162
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,840
okay

163
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,000
and one two three four five five rabbits

164
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,720
you've counted but no look six chicken

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,440
yeah

166
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,800
six chicken i'm talking about yeah

167
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,400
six chickens

168
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,680
six chicken how many how many legs two

169
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,080
plus but you yeah yeah yeah i know five

170
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,240
times four what's this

171
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,960
okay it's 32. yeah you're all right yes

172
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,960
yeah that was

173
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,879
10 but

174
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,440
it's still legs

175
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,400
okay so what's i see look 10 heads and

176
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,960
then

177
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,670
all legs this is 10 head

178
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,479
and here is legs

179
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,879
[Music]

180
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,479
okay so what's i see come on how can we

181
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,620
solve this problem

182
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,730
so look how can we say

183
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,730
[Music]

184
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,440
ryan do you understand what i'm talking

185
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,440
about

186
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,440
yeah

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,120
[Music]

188
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,950
so how can can we solve this or not

189
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:46,519
proof of thing can we just solve

190
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,519
[Music]

191
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,640
how do you know it's too late wow so

192
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,279
quick because i breathe

193
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,160
blue falls in your head so quickly

194
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,200
yay

195
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,519
okay okay so one way of doing this okay

196
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,440
you can't prove us for any

197
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,160
every other input right for this because

198
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,959
these two are inputs right yeah but

199
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,279
because if i see something really small

200
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,959
yeah really

201
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,640
yeah because this is more than our

202
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,360
possibility how many possibilities are

203
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,240
those uh i think there's five

204
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,720
five ten that'll be ten because i and c

205
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,600
pair yeah one co 10

206
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,920
no no no that would be there will be 11

207
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,959
11 possibilities the r will be from 0 to

208
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,519
10.

209
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,640
but what if there are it might be five

210
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,839
and c in my v5 and there's no point of

211
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,200
doing

212
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,040
two numbers two letters i mean

213
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,680
yeah yeah yeah look because i could how

214
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,320
many possibilities of ah

215
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,959
10 11 right r would be zero to any

216
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,120
number between zero ten so okay so look

217
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,640
how can we solve this one way of doing

218
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:03,399
it look here what's r r b equals ten

219
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,399
minus c right you can do this yeah

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,720
all right look from here

221
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,320
r equals 10 minus c

222
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,079
all right

223
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:18,240
okay then if we plug in this to here

224
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,800
so what 4 times 10 minus c plus 2c

225
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,079
equals 24. right and look

226
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,839
look what's this error look 40 minus 4c

227
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,760
plus 2c equals 24. okay 4t

228
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:34,079
minus 2c plus

229
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,079
minus 4c plus c equals one

230
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,160
minus four plus two equals one

231
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,920
minus zero

232
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,560
what's this

233
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,160
that is minus one

234
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,079
minus two c equals twenty 24

235
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,160
40 minus

236
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,839
something equals 24.

237
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,880
so 2c will be equals 6x

238
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,360
so c equals 8. so we know

239
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,320
look we plug in the c here

240
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,320
this is a so i is two right another way

241
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,680
of doing it look at this is c this is if

242
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,040
we times two

243
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,240
two r plus two c equals twenty right all

244
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,880
right

245
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,600
if you subtract these from here

246
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,839
four minus 2r to r

247
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,640
2c cancel out right

248
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,600
24 minus 20

249
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
for

250
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,399
r will be equals 2.

251
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,160
got it

252
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,399
right do you understand you're drawing

253
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,959
all the time do you understand

254
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,480
do you understand right

255
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,880
yeah make sense

256
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,839
yeah okay

257
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,839
okay one

258
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,680
i give you one example and then you tell

259
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,640
me if it's a

260
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
two

261
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
uh

262
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,480
linear equation with two unknowns okay

263
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,480
so x plus y equals 10

264
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,680
and i'm looking look at this

265
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:58,079
x times y equals 25 is this

266
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,079
is this the linear equation with 2 and 9

267
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,120
is it you don't need to solve it but if

268
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,120
you can solve it it will be good is it

269
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,600
x plus y equals 10 to two equations of

270
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,920
two equations two

271
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,040
[Music]

272
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,600
yeah it's five

273
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,760
but what's the point of doing two

274
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,200
variables even though they're the same

275
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,120
letter

276
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,360
the same number because i'm not telling

277
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,519
you i'm asking to solve it you need to

278
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,360
find out the value of xy but my question

279
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,399
is that is this a linear equation

280
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,000
is this

281
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,000
linear equation in two unknowns

282
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,079
you don't know okay this is

283
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,240
no okay why is that this time look x

284
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,440
plus y equals 10 and then we can do this

285
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,519
x equals 10 minus y right yeah

286
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,760
yeah if we plug in the value here look

287
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,279
what what do we have look

288
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,240
10 minus y

289
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,440
times y equals 25

290
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,240
10 y

291
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,360
minus y squared equals 25. do you still

292
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,200
think this is the linear

293
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,000
because this yeah this is nonlinear

294
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,160
right

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,519
okay so this is the before okay another

296
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,320
example

297
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,200
another example okay

298
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,920
look yeah look x divided by y is not

299
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,839
also no right it's not 0 because look x

300
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,639
plus y equals 10

301
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,279
x divided by y equals one is this a

302
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,040
linear equation

303
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,519
is a linear equation into unknowns

304
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,519
you say

305
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,880
no yeah because look if

306
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,240
if one this is the same as

307
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,680
x

308
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,079
yeah look

309
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,000
if y is not equal to zero right then we

310
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,360
can do uh maybe we can just do this

311
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,600
again look

312
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,560
x will be 10 minus y right

313
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,800
right and 10 minus y divided by y equals

314
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
1.

315
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,639
is it the equation is it a linear

316
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,639
equation

317
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,639
maybe look

318
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,519
then we can times y on both sides so

319
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,760
it's 10 minus y equals

320
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,959
equals y

321
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
10

322
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,000
equals to y

323
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,880
okay and i'm going to solve for y equals

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,279
five okay so the thing is this one is

325
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,760
very tricky because y cannot be

326
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,800
zero right cannot be z equal to zero

327
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,959
right

328
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,959
so

329
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,680
what

330
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,760
so i'm not sure if this is still called

331
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,639
the linear equation okay maybe not maybe

332
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,680
yes okay i most likely it's not a linear

333
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,560
equation

334
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,800
okay

335
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,800
but okay let's do this um

336
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,920
okay let's do this

337
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,959
okay can you go backseat please please

338
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,079
okay how about this x plus y equals 10

339
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,079
and then 2x plus 2y equals 20 is this

340
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,440
linear equation into

341
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:59,519
linear equation into unknowns i mean

342
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,120
is it can you solve this no why is that

343
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,519
why is that come on

344
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,199
not linear it's linear but you cannot

345
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,440
solve it why is that

346
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,399
because

347
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,440
because if x is one and

348
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,639
that is nine and two of it is

349
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,079
is

350
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,079
two one is it and then

351
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,519
eighteen

352
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,800
yeah

353
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,800
twenty

354
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,480
pluses

355
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,560
can you solve this equation

356
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,320
how many how many rules are how many

357
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,040
possibilities for this

358
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,920
can you solve it no

359
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,920
no no

360
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,839
lots of answers yeah look what because

361
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,360
the first equation is the same as the

362
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,480
second equation right because we just

363
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,480
times two

364
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,720
if we times two it's the same

365
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,519
so even though there are two equations

366
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,320
it's actually one right all right

367
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,839
yeah

368
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,079
okay

369
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,519
okay can we can we go can we focus not

370
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,240
drawing okay come on you throw it up

371
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,839
that sounds good

372
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,199
okay so now today

373
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,120
today we

374
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,519
okay so

375
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,800
okay so no no no no no

376
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,680
what's your

377
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,399
next problem remember

378
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,680
s and a yeah s has

379
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,959
how many numbers

380
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:20,399
three quarters three quarters three

381
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,399
three quarters of s is the same as two

382
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,880
fifths of a

383
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,079
a okay let's and then

384
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,600
a

385
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,600
more than s is what

386
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,920
490 okay so look

387
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,440
how do you come up with these two

388
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,199
equations you just read the problem

389
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,199
statement right and then you just

390
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,480
express the idea

391
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,680
in mathematics right i like look what's

392
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,279
this

393
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,639
two unknowns

394
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,360
two equations

395
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,920
right so we can solve it right

396
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,000
yeah okay so how do we solve it look

397
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,720
how can we solve it one way

398
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,720
one way is what a will be equals s plus

399
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,320
490 right look if we move the s to the

400
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,799
other side we need to change the size

401
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,079
right negative to positive positive to

402
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,679
negative right

403
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,559
and then now look

404
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,760
a we got a if we plug in

405
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,919
here

406
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,679
right so look

407
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:20,559
what do we have 3

408
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:25,760
4 s equals 2 5 and then we substitute

409
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:28,000
substitute a with s with s plus 460 90.

410
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,880
okay look

411
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,440
yeah so look now

412
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,440
we have one equation one unknown i know

413
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,480
we can solve it right

414
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,240
all right

415
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,360
we have one equation one and another and

416
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,200
ryan

417
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,360
can you leave to do that

418
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,480
all right how can we solve this

419
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,640
look here is four here is five so we

420
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,360
want to multiply both sides by a number

421
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,679
which is the least common multiple 20

422
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,799
yes we multiply 20 so that would be five

423
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,760
here

424
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,200
multiply 20 that will be four here right

425
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,480
right

426
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
how many of these

427
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,440
15x

428
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,480
how many of these

429
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,960
a

430
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,080
s plus 490 right

431
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,919
yes

432
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,280
all right

433
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:16,799
okay so what's this a times s

434
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,360
plus a times 490 right

435
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,600
right if we move this to the left side

436
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,799
how many s do we have

437
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:30,160
15x minus a s is 7s

438
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:33,280
equals 8 times 490. so what's s what's s

439
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,039
let's divide the both sides by seven

440
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,440
right

441
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,320
i was this number eight times 490

442
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,320
divided by seven

443
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,679
this is 70.

444
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,760
yeah

445
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,919
so it's 560.

446
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,600
s is 560.

447
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,600
and i'll park in here 560 plus 490

448
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,679
equals

449
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,640
10.50 right

450
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,880
this is how we solve this equation okay

451
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,880
okay

452
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,880
so

453
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,360
look

454
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,480
we coming back to the nothing chicken

455
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,559
problem okay so let's say if we have uh

456
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,440
we want to solve this problem you know

457
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,960
we use heads we have heads and now we

458
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,559
have next

459
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,799
so you need to tell me

460
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,760
the number of the rapid and number of

461
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,480
chicken you know with edge and air right

462
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,880
yeah if it if there's no such answer we

463
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,360
just written none okay so one way how

464
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,600
can computers solve this

465
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
by

466
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,400
looking forward yeah proofreading all

467
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,559
the equations okay look look uh four

468
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,320
times r plus

469
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,120
2 times

470
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,640
c

471
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,039
that's the length right let's select

472
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,400
and then r plus c equals 1 that's the

473
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,760
head

474
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,760
yeah

475
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,919
right

476
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,600
we can solve this equation

477
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,679
and then solve this and then ask

478
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,799
computer just to return this how can we

479
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,000
solve this look

480
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,640
come on all right so r equals h minus c

481
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,919
right and then we plug in here

482
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,799
so four times h minus c plus 2c equals l

483
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,159
look

484
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,480
4 times h minus 4c

485
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,200
plus 2c equals a

486
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,960
this is familiar because for c and l we

487
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,120
already know it

488
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,280
four times h minus four two c equals l

489
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,159
right so two c

490
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,600
equals four times h minus

491
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,440
l right

492
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,760
right if we move this to the right hand

493
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,919
side and move this to the left side

494
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,520
so c equals

495
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,919
4 times h minus l divided by 2

496
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,440
right up

497
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,960
now

498
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,000
so look c will be equal as four times h

499
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,320
minus air divided by two divided divided

500
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,600
by two okay divided by two

501
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,440
divided by two divided by two

502
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,480
right and then air

503
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,000
r

504
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,960
r will be what r will be h minus here h

505
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,960
h is given minus c

506
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,679
okay so there's one before

507
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,159
if this is not uh

508
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,799
if this is not a

509
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,120
even number yeah you divided by two that

510
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,480
will give incorrect answer right

511
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,440
right

512
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,440
so

513
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,240
one way of doing this is what we can

514
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,559
verify these two numbers yeah we got a c

515
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,679
and r now we can just say

516
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,640
if

517
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,520
r plus c equal equals

518
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,880
h

519
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,240
and

520
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,640
yeah

521
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,320
i i don't think we need it because this

522
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,880
r plus h

523
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,559
is always equal right

524
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,720
this is all this condition is always

525
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,000
true the problem is this one

526
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,840
e4 times r plus two times c

527
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,799
equal equal air

528
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,120
then we can return

529
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,120
okay return a top ten okay all

530
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,720
how do you pronounce this word t-u-p-i-e

531
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,640
actually it's tough

532
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,440
because i i google it

533
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,520
it's called temple okay stop him

534
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,159
he said it's people yeah

535
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,159
my mistake okay c and ah

536
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,320
it's tougher okay

537
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,000
we just turn the tupper okay

538
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,080
we return the top of can you not play

539
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,480
with these come on what did that you

540
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
just say

541
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,559
the chicken and rabbit

542
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,960
okay and otherwise we just return okay

543
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,640
oh we don't need we don't by default we

544
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,559
don't need to write it okay we can now

545
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,360
what why is this can you can you explain

546
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,400
to me that if i calculate cnr why do i

547
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,600
need to

548
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,200
do this

549
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,720
check

550
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,120
what did you say what's the prefer of

551
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,120
this one

552
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,400
sorry what's the preference

553
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,799
okay let me repeat one more time right

554
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,120
because four times h minus f could be an

555
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,799
odd number you cannot divide it by two

556
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,280
because for the chicken and rabbit there

557
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,559
is no half right there's no such thing

558
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,320
as half chicken

559
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,880
or half rabbit

560
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,559
yeah good what's that

561
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,120
but if you times it by four that means

562
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,440
it could divide it by two but air the

563
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,360
problem the point is air

564
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,840
why is that why

565
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,880
in what case is the air b these whole

566
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,360
thing can be look four times h is a

567
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,360
even number that's a very good point so

568
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,480
this whole thing when c

569
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,000
when four times h minus air is an odd

570
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,720
number

571
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,799
so

572
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,720
in what cases it could be a odd number

573
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,279
why don't you just steve

574
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,240
sorry let me repeat my question

575
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,120
for

576
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,840
four times h minus air

577
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,799
in what cases this is going to be all

578
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,279
numbers

579
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:56,799
this whole thing is an even number and

580
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,000
at least if it's air what's the air

581
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,360
what's the air

582
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,080
the legs

583
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,559
why

584
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,000
if it's all number of legs can you solve

585
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,480
it no no because chicken two legs rabbit

586
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,679
four legs how come it could be

587
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,360
five

588
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,400
odd number right

589
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,559
all right

590
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,120
okay so one way of doing this that if

591
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,120
you can say if air is odd you know

592
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,760
divided by 2 equals 1 is all that will

593
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,320
be 10 because there's no such solution

594
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,080
or the other way is you you calculate

595
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,080
this number yeah you remember you have

596
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,840
this divided by 2. and then you double

597
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,240
check the legs

598
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,480
yeah double check and then you make sure

599
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,960
we already have we know it's a valid

600
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,480
solution otherwise we just written that

601
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,480
what's the time complexity for this one

602
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,760
oh

603
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,640
that's your that's the one you should

604
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,400
guess one a one why is that because i

605
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,919
like it

606
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,320
why is that because we just use

607
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,799
mathematics to solve this no matter how

608
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,799
big is actually an air

609
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,480
instantly we just solve this equation

610
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,880
instantly the computer just solve it

611
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,840
instantly we don't use any additional

612
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,919
linears

613
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,159
in a space yeah so time and space

614
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,240
complexity is a one

615
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,000
yeah this is the case

616
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,000
one we just solve the mathematic

617
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,240
equation but if you're using the for

618
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,840
loop what's the time complexity

619
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,200
okay okay let's use something for how

620
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,679
can we grow first

621
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,480
how can we perform if we have a head we

622
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,960
can prove us either chicken or rabbit

623
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,960
right we can try right

624
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,480
so how can we prove us that

625
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,760
please let's

626
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,840
let's proof of the weapon okay yeah

627
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,960
all right

628
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,480
so for

629
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,520
rabbit

630
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,440
in

631
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,880
star wars in what in in range

632
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,559
range

633
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,159
range h plus 1 right h plus 1 means the

634
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,880
range this

635
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,000
plane so we are we are guessing we are

636
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,760
trying we are guessing the rapid is from

637
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,080
0 to h inclusive right we have a r so

638
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,400
what's c here if we guess r now what's

639
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,400
the c

640
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,400
c

641
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,600
r plus the c equals h right yeah

642
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,840
so i know ah so what's that what's c i

643
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,640
know r i know h what's c

644
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,709
come on this is easy

645
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,709
[Music]

646
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,039
easy yeah okay so now we want to double

647
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:29,279
check the air the legs

648
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,279
if how many legs of rabbit

649
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,400
rub it what

650
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,600
what

651
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,240
how many how many necks

652
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,679
times four plus how many how many legs

653
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,480
of chicken

654
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,200
two

655
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,799
three times four equal equal

656
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,000
three times four

657
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,440
equals one

658
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,159
because uh

659
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,159
well already

660
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,880
actually we don't need to write it

661
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,200
it will be automatically written now

662
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,200
it just

663
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,760
really what's the time to max t what is

664
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,440
that how would it just return

665
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,760
because when it reached here at this

666
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,679
point it means there is no solution in

667
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,480
here there is no such thing look we are

668
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,840
working

669
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:30,000
doesn't it just do excuse things

670
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,399
excuse me excuse me like screaming oh no

671
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,559
no no no look the computer just saw here

672
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,279
and here this one right and then you

673
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,440
clicked because if you haven't told the

674
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,080
computer what to return at this point so

675
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,120
it's you you will soon return nothing

676
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,120
none

677
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,159
right so what are we doing we are trying

678
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,440
every possibility of r from zero to h

679
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,480
all right and now we calculate the

680
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,880
chicken

681
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,960
and then we check yeah this is to check

682
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,799
if if the next

683
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,640
set is fine then we return we found a

684
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,679
very solution and that's it

685
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,679
blue forcing what's the term complexity

686
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,640
[Music]

687
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,840
what's n how many in the worst case

688
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,640
what's the m how many iterations here

689
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,120
and

690
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,360
what's n

691
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,360
[Music]

692
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,640
in how many iterations we need to check

693
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,000
how many possibilities for the r

694
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,799
for a rabbit

695
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,799
given h hat

696
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,159
yeah

697
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,000
come on

698
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,039
how many iterations of this

699
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,039
yeah

700
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,320
oh h plus one but we dropped the

701
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,960
constant yeah

702
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,200
yeah they're all the possibilities from

703
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,760
zero to h

704
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,600
and that will be h plus one and with o h

705
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,520
so the time time next is o h what's the

706
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,440
space complexity

707
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,080
oh okay yeah that's o

708
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,080
what's a space complexity

709
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,240
so which one is better

710
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,600
the one before

711
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,880
why is that because

712
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,360
because we are

713
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,000
because of the capacity

714
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,039
is quicker yeah it's it's it's

715
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,520
it's not depending on the size of h no

716
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,919
matter if h is a minion

717
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,520
this needs to take a linear iteration

718
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,720
but for the previous one we just do the

719
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,480
calculation yeah with human do the math

720
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,559
calculation and then we translate the

721
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,880
calculation to computer code and the

722
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,520
computer to go and just work it out by

723
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,159
doing some math computation it's linear

724
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,440
it's not it's not in its instant right

725
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,440
correct

726
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,440
today so to sum up

727
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,840
what we have done today

728
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,600
chicken graphic and then linear equation

729
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,799
with two unknowns yeah how do we solve

730
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:00,000
the linear equation with two unknowns we

731
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,720
look if x plus y equals something so we

732
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,480
we plug in the values of one variable

733
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,200
into another equation so then we can

734
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,440
make it one linear equation with one

735
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,760
unknown am right

736
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,399
okay okay that's it for today that's it

737
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,720
for the bye bye

738
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,720
bye bye
