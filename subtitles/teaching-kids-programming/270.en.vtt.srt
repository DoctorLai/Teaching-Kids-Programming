hello mister mr ryan how are you today
good good okay okay so remember we

8
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
good good okay okay so remember we
 

9
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,350
good good okay okay so remember we
talked about graph recently okay what's

10
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
talked about graph recently okay what's
 

11
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,509
talked about graph recently okay what's
graph a graph in the graph which is the

12
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:11,519
graph a graph in the graph which is the
 

13
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,230
graph a graph in the graph which is the
graph which is a tree

14
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
graph which is a tree
 

15
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,070
graph which is a tree
tree it's also a graph yeah data

16
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
tree it's also a graph yeah data
 

17
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,310
tree it's also a graph yeah data
structure and we can use it as a g

18
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
structure and we can use it as a g
 

19
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,429
structure and we can use it as a g
like that

20
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
like that
 

21
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,589
like that
what component does it have the graph

22
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599

 

23
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,310

vertex energies v for vertex and e for

24
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
vertex energies v for vertex and e for
 

25
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,470
vertex energies v for vertex and e for
edges okay and they can have at least a

26
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
edges okay and they can have at least a
 

27
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,950
edges okay and they can have at least a
directional graph d-a-g d-a-g

28
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:32,960
directional graph d-a-g d-a-g
 

29
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,190
directional graph d-a-g d-a-g
directional a cyclic which doesn't have

30
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
directional a cyclic which doesn't have
 

31
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,790
directional a cyclic which doesn't have
cycles and

32
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
cycles and
 

33
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,869
cycles and
directly means that the

34
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
directly means that the
 

35
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,869
directly means that the
from a to b but not especially from b to

36
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
from a to b but not especially from b to
 

37
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,190
from a to b but not especially from b to
any okay so that's that and don't know

38
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
any okay so that's that and don't know
 

39
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,830
any okay so that's that and don't know
essentially yeah let's talk about this

40
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
essentially yeah let's talk about this
 

41
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,150
essentially yeah let's talk about this
directive graph okay so given the direct

42
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,160
directive graph okay so given the direct
 

43
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,670
directive graph okay so given the direct
graph okay uh

44
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
graph okay uh
 

45
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,869
graph okay uh
like look

46
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
like look
 

47
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,990
like look
one

48
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000
one
 

49
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,110
one
and then

50
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
and then
 

51
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,470
and then
uh

52
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
uh
 

53
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,950
uh
two

54
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960

 

55
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,950

three okay and then i have at least four

56
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
three okay and then i have at least four
 

57
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,750
three okay and then i have at least four
and then it's five

58
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
and then it's five
 

59
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,429
and then it's five
and six

60
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
and six
 

61
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,870
and six
okay

62
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
okay
 

63
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,990
okay
yeah

64
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
yeah
 

65
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,870
yeah
uh

66
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
uh
 

67
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,510
uh
so this is direct graph and okay so we

68
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
so this is direct graph and okay so we
 

69
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,070
so this is direct graph and okay so we
can have this weight you know the weight

70
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
can have this weight you know the weight
 

71
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,230
can have this weight you know the weight
w-e-i-g-s-t

72
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
w-e-i-g-s-t
 

73
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,429
w-e-i-g-s-t
weight associated for weight is the

74
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
weight associated for weight is the
 

75
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,789
weight associated for weight is the
association

76
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
association
 

77
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,350
association
line from four to six to eight

78
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
line from four to six to eight
 

79
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,149
line from four to six to eight
nine

80
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
nine
 

81
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,190
nine
not three to fight it'll make a pentagon

82
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
not three to fight it'll make a pentagon
 

83
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,670
not three to fight it'll make a pentagon
okay okay so what wait wait is like i

84
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
okay okay so what wait wait is like i
 

85
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,670
okay okay so what wait wait is like i
can have this i can have a different

86
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
can have this i can have a different
 

87
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,950
can have this i can have a different
weight for each ages i can label the

88
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
weight for each ages i can label the
 

89
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,030
weight for each ages i can label the
the cost for example like this

90
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
the cost for example like this
 

91
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,990
the cost for example like this
three

92
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
three
 

93
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,590
three
four and there is five two one okay so

94
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
four and there is five two one okay so
 

95
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,910
four and there is five two one okay so
what does it mean it means that from one

96
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
what does it mean it means that from one
 

97
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,230
what does it mean it means that from one
to two it takes

98
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
to two it takes
 

99
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,270
to two it takes
three seconds from one to two right yeah

100
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
three seconds from one to two right yeah
 

101
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,109
three seconds from one to two right yeah
maybe three second or three you know it

102
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
maybe three second or three you know it
 

103
00:01:51,119 --> 00:02:06,950
maybe three second or three you know it
costs three three units

104
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960

 

105
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,190

four parts for example or three seconds

106
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
four parts for example or three seconds
 

107
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,949
four parts for example or three seconds
four seconds can you listen to me right

108
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
four seconds can you listen to me right
 

109
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,949
four seconds can you listen to me right
now

110
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
now
 

111
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,869
now
okay second one to five

112
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
okay second one to five
 

113
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,110
okay second one to five
one to four okay one two four five

114
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
one to four okay one two four five
 

115
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,750
one to four okay one two four five
seconds and four to two

116
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
seconds and four to two
 

117
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,949
seconds and four to two
four to five

118
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
four to five
 

119
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,430
four to five
two seconds

120
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
two seconds
 

121
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,990
two seconds
four to six one second okay so you have

122
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
four to six one second okay so you have
 

123
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,910
four to six one second okay so you have
look at this number above the edges is

124
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
look at this number above the edges is
 

125
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,750
look at this number above the edges is
called weight okay you can

126
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
called weight okay you can
 

127
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,150
called weight okay you can
in real world it can mean something like

128
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
in real world it can mean something like
 

129
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,830
in real world it can mean something like
that

130
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
that
 

131
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,990
that
good point yeah yeah it's a tree yeah

132
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
good point yeah yeah it's a tree yeah
 

133
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,630
good point yeah yeah it's a tree yeah
three is kind of the d.i.g right yeah

134
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
three is kind of the d.i.g right yeah
 

135
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,990
three is kind of the d.i.g right yeah
we're talking about graph here yeah

136
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
we're talking about graph here yeah
 

137
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,990
we're talking about graph here yeah
three is kind of graph okay

138
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
three is kind of graph okay
 

139
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,430
three is kind of graph okay
that is a trait cag okay yeah it doesn't

140
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
that is a trait cag okay yeah it doesn't
 

141
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,869
that is a trait cag okay yeah it doesn't
look like this

142
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
look like this
 

143
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:57,150
look like this
it's a tree like root left right

144

right yeah all right ryan can you listen

174
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
right yeah all right ryan can you listen
 

175
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,630
right yeah all right ryan can you listen
to me i'm playing with that okay your

176
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
to me i'm playing with that okay your
 

177
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,430
to me i'm playing with that okay your
own video okay come on

178
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
own video okay come on
 

179
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,390
own video okay come on
yeah yeah

180
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
yeah yeah
 

181
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,670
yeah yeah
yeah so

182
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
yeah so
 

183
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,630
yeah so
in this case what's the answer but one

184
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
in this case what's the answer but one
 

185
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,789
in this case what's the answer but one
we want to find out the distance between

186
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
we want to find out the distance between
 

187
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,550
we want to find out the distance between
the the shortest distance yeah so

188
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
the the shortest distance yeah so
 

189
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,869
the the shortest distance yeah so
let's start this decision for example if

190
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
let's start this decision for example if
 

191
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,229
let's start this decision for example if
i have another one one two three

192
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
i have another one one two three
 

193
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,270
i have another one one two three
let's uh let's a hundred okay that's

194
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
let's uh let's a hundred okay that's
 

195
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,670
let's uh let's a hundred okay that's
impossible no no no i'm talking about

196
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
impossible no no no i'm talking about
 

197
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,630
impossible no no no i'm talking about
100 seconds yeah okay so i'm so what's

198
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
100 seconds yeah okay so i'm so what's
 

199
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,470
100 seconds yeah okay so i'm so what's
the choppy distance between one two

200
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
the choppy distance between one two
 

201
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,070
the choppy distance between one two
three

202
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
three
 

203
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,429
three
um

204
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
um
 

205
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,830
um
go three four where that goes three four

206
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
go three four where that goes three four
 

207
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,909
go three four where that goes three four
this seven is is much faster than a

208
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
this seven is is much faster than a
 

209
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,310
this seven is is much faster than a
hundred no no it's possible in new york

210
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
hundred no no it's possible in new york
 

211
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,469
hundred no no it's possible in new york
i mean for example if there are lots of

212
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
i mean for example if there are lots of
 

213
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,830
i mean for example if there are lots of
traffic in this world right you know

214
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840
traffic in this world right you know
 

215
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,230
traffic in this world right you know
yeah yeah and then the the gps the the

216
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
yeah yeah and then the the gps the the
 

217
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,590
yeah yeah and then the the gps the the
navigator

218
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
navigator
 

219
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,590
navigator
tell us that it's better to travel the

220
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
tell us that it's better to travel the
 

221
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,350
tell us that it's better to travel the
other road which is faster because

222
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
other road which is faster because
 

223
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,830
other road which is faster because
they're less traffic yeah okay

224
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
they're less traffic yeah okay
 

225
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,270
they're less traffic yeah okay
okay so the question

226
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280

 

227
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,030

lights no no is no no no no no

228
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
lights no no is no no no no no
 

229
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,270
lights no no is no no no no no
okay

230
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280

 

231
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,310

listen listen up um one

232
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
listen listen up um one
 

233
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,990
listen listen up um one
so we want to find out the maximum unit

234
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
so we want to find out the maximum unit
 

235
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,670
so we want to find out the maximum unit
okay so the first question is that we

236
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
okay so the first question is that we
 

237
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,350
okay so the first question is that we
want to find out the shortest distance

238
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
want to find out the shortest distance
 

239
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,909
want to find out the shortest distance
between one to each node okay

240
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
between one to each node okay
 

241
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,230
between one to each node okay
yeah or any nodes for example like four

242
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
yeah or any nodes for example like four
 

243
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,350
yeah or any nodes for example like four
to five is two and then if i can have uh

244
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
to five is two and then if i can have uh
 

245
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,670
to five is two and then if i can have uh
another one here

246
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
another one here
 

247
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,749
another one here
like seven here if this is zero

248
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
like seven here if this is zero
 

249
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,310
like seven here if this is zero
and this is zero what's the night time

250
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
and this is zero what's the night time
 

251
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,390
and this is zero what's the night time
oh zero point five zero point five it

252
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
oh zero point five zero point five it
 

253
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,629
oh zero point five zero point five it
takes how much what's the thirties

254
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
takes how much what's the thirties
 

255
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,870
takes how much what's the thirties
yeah

256
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
yeah
 

257
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,990
yeah
zero point

258
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
zero point
 

259
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,430
zero point
zero yeah exactly okay so given the png

260
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
zero yeah exactly okay so given the png
 

261
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,390
zero yeah exactly okay so given the png
a graph graph we also find out the

262
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
a graph graph we also find out the
 

263
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,110
a graph graph we also find out the
shortest distance between any two

264
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
shortest distance between any two
 

265
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,189
shortest distance between any two
any two okay we want to find out the

266
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
any two okay we want to find out the
 

267
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,150
any two okay we want to find out the
shortest pieces between any two uh

268
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
shortest pieces between any two uh
 

269
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,830
shortest pieces between any two uh
notes

270
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
notes
 

271
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,430
notes
so today we'll talk about this problem

272
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
so today we'll talk about this problem
 

273
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,390
so today we'll talk about this problem
right

274
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
right
 

275
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,189
right
yeah

276
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
yeah
 

277
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,749
yeah
because this is important to know that

278
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
because this is important to know that
 

279
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,590
because this is important to know that
if i want to give it a start i want to

280
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
if i want to give it a start i want to
 

281
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,909
if i want to give it a start i want to
find out the maximum you need to travel

282
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
find out the maximum you need to travel
 

283
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,189
find out the maximum you need to travel
all the nodes

284
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
all the nodes
 

285
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,469
all the nodes
from one

286
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
from one
 

287
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,510
from one
right

288
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
right
 

289
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,469
right
yeah

290
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
yeah
 

291
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,870
yeah
and then we can visualize it as the

292
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
and then we can visualize it as the
 

293
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,870
and then we can visualize it as the
shortest distance between one to every

294
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
shortest distance between one to every
 

295
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,150
shortest distance between one to every
other nodes

296
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
other nodes
 

297
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,270
other nodes
yeah and

298
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
yeah and
 

299
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,749
yeah and
you find the maximum right and sometimes

300
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
you find the maximum right and sometimes
 

301
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,070
you find the maximum right and sometimes
look if one doesn't reach seven

302
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
look if one doesn't reach seven
 

303
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,629
look if one doesn't reach seven
uh uh maybe ten here

304
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
uh uh maybe ten here
 

305
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,309
uh uh maybe ten here
right

306
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
right
 

307
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,230
right
i know but there's no path between one

308
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
i know but there's no path between one
 

309
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,950
i know but there's no path between one
to ten right so we return to minus one

310
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
to ten right so we return to minus one
 

311
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,790
to ten right so we return to minus one
okay in this case okay

312
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
okay in this case okay
 

313
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,550
okay in this case okay
10 is only its own so yeah

314
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
10 is only its own so yeah
 

315
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,390
10 is only its own so yeah
what's that

316
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
what's that
 

317
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,550
what's that
you mentioned uh your understanding is

318
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
you mentioned uh your understanding is
 

319
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,790
you mentioned uh your understanding is
that if if a node

320
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
that if if a node
 

321
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,189
that if if a node
one traveled to two

322
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
one traveled to two
 

323
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,990
one traveled to two
right

324
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
right
 

325
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,950
right
we know this cost us cost one

326
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
we know this cost us cost one
 

327
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,270
we know this cost us cost one
and if one travels to another any other

328
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
and if one travels to another any other
 

329
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,629
and if one travels to another any other
laws uh let's uh n

330
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
laws uh let's uh n
 

331
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,070
laws uh let's uh n
yeah if this is c2 and this is c3

332
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
yeah if this is c2 and this is c3
 

333
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,150
yeah if this is c2 and this is c3
right if c1 is smaller

334
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
right if c1 is smaller
 

335
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,510
right if c1 is smaller
if c2

336
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
if c2
 

337
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,830
if c2
plus c3 is smaller than c1

338
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
plus c3 is smaller than c1
 

339
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,309
plus c3 is smaller than c1
right yeah then we update the cost

340
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
right yeah then we update the cost
 

341
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,790
right yeah then we update the cost
from one to two with this update yeah

342
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
from one to two with this update yeah
 

343
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,110
from one to two with this update yeah
because this is not faster right

344
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
because this is not faster right
 

345
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,029
because this is not faster right
yeah we realize that

346
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
yeah we realize that
 

347
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,189
yeah we realize that
one thing no no no because we have a

348
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
one thing no no no because we have a
 

349
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,430
one thing no no no because we have a
weight we have weight you can you can

350
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
weight we have weight you can you can
 

351
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,390
weight we have weight you can you can
consider it as the time the cost

352
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
consider it as the time the cost
 

353
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,710
consider it as the time the cost
correct it's not a you know it's not a

354
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
correct it's not a you know it's not a
 

355
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,270
correct it's not a you know it's not a
geography distance it's the cost with

356
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
geography distance it's the cost with
 

357
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,710
geography distance it's the cost with
the cost okay

358
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
the cost okay
 

359
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,589
the cost okay
so

360
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
so
 

361
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,589
so
so we want to find out basically today's

362
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
so we want to find out basically today's
 

363
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,189
so we want to find out basically today's
project that we want to find out the

364
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
project that we want to find out the
 

365
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,990
project that we want to find out the
shortest distance between any two nodes

366
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
shortest distance between any two nodes
 

367
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,990
shortest distance between any two nodes
any two nodes okay

368
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
any two nodes okay
 

369
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,150
any two nodes okay
so how can we do it how can we do it

370
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
so how can we do it how can we do it
 

371
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,550
so how can we do it how can we do it
based on this if we update it

372
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
based on this if we update it
 

373
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,589
based on this if we update it
if we iterate all the nodes right all

374
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
if we iterate all the nodes right all
 

375
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,870
if we iterate all the nodes right all
the pairs

376
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
the pairs
 

377
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,510
the pairs
if we iterate all the all the pairs and

378
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520

 

379
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,270

and we update the shortest path right

380
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
and we update the shortest path right
 

381
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,390
and we update the shortest path right
this yeah we updated something

382
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
this yeah we updated something
 

383
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,749
this yeah we updated something
if we find that

384
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
if we find that
 

385
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,710
if we find that
if we find a replacement while this is

386
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
if we find a replacement while this is
 

387
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,469
if we find a replacement while this is
working eric look

388
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
working eric look
 

389
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,990
working eric look
okay

okay
 

391
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,550
okay
why this is working i i i explained to

392
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
why this is working i i i explained to
 

393
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,029
why this is working i i i explained to
you okay can you listen to me look if

394
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
you okay can you listen to me look if
 

395
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,029
you okay can you listen to me look if
this is the path right this is the path

396
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
this is the path right this is the path
 

397
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,469
this is the path right this is the path
a question

398
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
a question
 

399
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,469
a question
a2

400

b
 

405
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,270
b
and then here would be c

406
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
and then here would be c
 

407
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,990
and then here would be c
okay so if if there there's another part

408
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
okay so if if there there's another part
 

409
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,189
okay so if if there there's another part
here influence there's a d and then

410
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
here influence there's a d and then
 

411
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,950
here influence there's a d and then
let's say e

412
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
let's say e
 

413
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,909
let's say e
okay

414
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
okay
 

415
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,830
okay
on

416
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
on
 

417
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,390
on
that i'm there all underwear okay

418
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
that i'm there all underwear okay
 

419
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,309
that i'm there all underwear okay
okay so we want to find out the shortest

420
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
okay so we want to find out the shortest
 

421
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,070
okay so we want to find out the shortest
season between d to e

422
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
season between d to e
 

423
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,710
season between d to e
okay if this is like a hundred this is

424
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
okay if this is like a hundred this is
 

425
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,629
okay if this is like a hundred this is
ten this is twenty

426
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
ten this is twenty
 

427
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,550
ten this is twenty
okay

428
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
okay
 

429
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,589
okay
yeah how about the d to a and b to e d

430
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
yeah how about the d to a and b to e d
 

431
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,630
yeah how about the d to a and b to e d
to a no no okay this this may be uh one

432
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
to a no no okay this this may be uh one
 

433
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,709
to a no no okay this this may be uh one
this is one okay

434
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
this is one okay
 

435
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,909
this is one okay
so look

436
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
so look
 

437
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,149
so look
look we can find out we can always

438
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
look we can find out we can always
 

439
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,469
look we can find out we can always
replace replace because a to b a to b it

440
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
replace replace because a to b a to b it
 

441
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,590
replace replace because a to b a to b it
costs the ultimate from 10 plus 20

442
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
costs the ultimate from 10 plus 20
 

443
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,430
costs the ultimate from 10 plus 20
instead of 100 right so we can always

444
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
instead of 100 right so we can always
 

445
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,670
instead of 100 right so we can always
replace the overall plus d to e to w

446
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
replace the overall plus d to e to w
 

447
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,070
replace the overall plus d to e to w
with this bit yeah so the ultimate path

448
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
with this bit yeah so the ultimate path
 

449
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,070
with this bit yeah so the ultimate path
will be d a a c c b e right it's much

450
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
will be d a a c c b e right it's much
 

451
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,990
will be d a a c c b e right it's much
better than d a a b b e all right yeah

452
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
better than d a a b b e all right yeah
 

453
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,470
better than d a a b b e all right yeah
yeah if i replace it with this and even

454
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
yeah if i replace it with this and even
 

455
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,389
yeah if i replace it with this and even
later i found out if there's another

456
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
later i found out if there's another
 

457
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,190
later i found out if there's another
part called the g

458
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
part called the g
 

459
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,230
part called the g
which is 5 5 and then i can update the

460
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
which is 5 5 and then i can update the
 

461
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,470
which is 5 5 and then i can update the
path the whole path with this one right

462
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
path the whole path with this one right
 

463
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,389
path the whole path with this one right
yeah with this one yeah one d a a g g b

464
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
yeah with this one yeah one d a a g g b
 

465
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,870
yeah with this one yeah one d a a g g b
e you see so we keep updating this until

466
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
e you see so we keep updating this until
 

467
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,670
e you see so we keep updating this until
we found the yeah the past the shortest

468
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
we found the yeah the past the shortest
 

469
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,110
we found the yeah the past the shortest
participation

470
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
participation
 

471
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,070
participation
got it yeah so if there are n

472
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
got it yeah so if there are n
 

473
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,150
got it yeah so if there are n
no vertex here we're talking about today

474
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
no vertex here we're talking about today
 

475
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,990
no vertex here we're talking about today
we want to find out the 30 statement

476
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
we want to find out the 30 statement
 

477
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,230
we want to find out the 30 statement
between any two vertex

478
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
between any two vertex
 

479
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,150
between any two vertex
in a graph

480
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
in a graph
 

481
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,590
in a graph
yeah in the graph

482
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
yeah in the graph
 

483
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,870
yeah in the graph
okay so the extension if if we

484
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
okay so the extension if if we
 

485
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,150
okay so the extension if if we
okay let us do this okay define

486
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
okay let us do this okay define
 

487
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,430
okay let us do this okay define
uh shortest distance okay shortest

488
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
uh shortest distance okay shortest
 

489
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,550
uh shortest distance okay shortest
distance

490
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560

 

491
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,590

that's a graph okay and then we have a n

492
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
that's a graph okay and then we have a n
 

493
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,350
that's a graph okay and then we have a n
and any

494
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
and any
 

495
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,430
and any
number of vertices okay

496
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
number of vertices okay
 

497
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,870
number of vertices okay
uh

498
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
uh
 

499
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,870
uh
so first of all we want to have a uh

500
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
so first of all we want to have a uh
 

501
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,230
so first of all we want to have a uh

for what we do in math and we

536
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
for what we do in math and we
 

537
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,030
for what we do in math and we
range and right

538
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
range and right
 

539
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,550
range and right
now this is the least and then four

540
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
now this is the least and then four
 

541
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,870
now this is the least and then four
in range area this is a

542
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
in range area this is a
 

543
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,150
in range area this is a

544
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
uh
 

545
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,590
uh
range n so this is the

546
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
range n so this is the
 

547
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,310
range n so this is the
this gives the this distance

548
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
this gives the this distance
 

549
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,630
this gives the this distance
to the dimensional ray which is which we

550
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
to the dimensional ray which is which we
 

551
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,069
to the dimensional ray which is which we
can visualize it as look the distance

552
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
can visualize it as look the distance
 

553
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,670
can visualize it as look the distance
this one one what does it mean

554
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
this one one what does it mean
 

555
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,670
this one one what does it mean
one two okay so it's the vertex one two

556
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
one two okay so it's the vertex one two
 

557
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,150
one two okay so it's the vertex one two
vertex two

the distance the short resistance okay

560
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
the distance the short resistance okay
 

561
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,069
the distance the short resistance okay
so can you tell me that uh

562
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
so can you tell me that uh
 

563
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:12,949
so can you tell me that uh
if

564
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
if
 

565
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,829
if
if what's the value of this like zero

566
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
if what's the value of this like zero
 

567
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,790
if what's the value of this like zero
zero

568
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
zero
 

569
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,550
zero
what should i give it like one one so

570
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
what should i give it like one one so
 

571
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,550
what should i give it like one one so
this this

572
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
this this
 

573
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,389
this this
a a

574
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
a a
 

575
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,910
a a
what's your should we

576
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
what's your should we
 

577
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,150
what's your should we
assign the values to it but now let's

578
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
assign the values to it but now let's
 

579
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,150
assign the values to it but now let's
see what is the distance between the

580
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
see what is the distance between the
 

581
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,550
see what is the distance between the
node to itself

582
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
node to itself
 

583
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,670
node to itself
okay so zero to one

584
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
okay so zero to one
 

585
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,670
okay so zero to one
okay zero to one this is

586
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
okay zero to one this is
 

587
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,430
okay zero to one this is
one okay and what's the distance between

588
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
one okay and what's the distance between
 

589
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,190
one okay and what's the distance between
zero to zero

590
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
zero to zero
 

591
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,550
zero to zero
come on what's the value what's the

592
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
come on what's the value what's the
 

593
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,790
come on what's the value what's the
what's the value that we should give

594
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:44,800
what's the value that we should give
 

595
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,829
what's the value that we should give
initialize to zero to one one yeah zero

596
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
initialize to zero to one one yeah zero
 

597
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,990
initialize to zero to one one yeah zero
zero yeah because it costs nothing to

598
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
zero yeah because it costs nothing to
 

599
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,509
zero yeah because it costs nothing to
you're already there yeah it costs zero

600
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
you're already there yeah it costs zero
 

601
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,670
you're already there yeah it costs zero
we're done so so

602
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
we're done so so
 

603
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,269
we're done so so
so what should we do

604
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
so what should we do
 

605
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,110
so what should we do
for i

606
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
for i
 

607
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,670
for i
in range

608
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
in range
 

609
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,509
in range
n right

610
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
n right
 

611
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,990
n right
yeah and then what what we do this i i

612
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
yeah and then what what we do this i i
 

613
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,750
yeah and then what what we do this i i
equals one

614
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
equals one
 

615
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,949
equals one
this is

616
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959

 

617
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,870

come on this is from the distance

618
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
come on this is from the distance
 

619
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,389
come on this is from the distance
between eyes and the vertex eye to

620
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:16,399
between eyes and the vertex eye to
 

621
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,509
between eyes and the vertex eye to
vertex i i

622
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
vertex i i
 

623
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,710
vertex i i
you just said it before zero okay

624
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
you just said it before zero okay
 

625
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,750
you just said it before zero okay
okay so this look how this matrix okay

626
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
okay so this look how this matrix okay
 

627
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,509
okay so this look how this matrix okay
this magic will be something like that

628
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
this magic will be something like that
 

629
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,590
this magic will be something like that
if layer look array yeah if there is a

630
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
if layer look array yeah if there is a
 

631
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,509
if layer look array yeah if there is a
two dimensional right if n is like a

632
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
two dimensional right if n is like a
 

633
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,670
two dimensional right if n is like a
four let's do it as four okay if n

634
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680
four let's do it as four okay if n
 

635
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,230
four let's do it as four okay if n
equals four so this is give a magic what

636
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
equals four so this is give a magic what
 

637
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,230
equals four so this is give a magic what
can you feel that magic

638
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240

 

639
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,910

this iii so

640
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
this iii so
 

641
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,110
this iii so
this diagonal will be zero right

642
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
this diagonal will be zero right
 

643
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,190
this diagonal will be zero right
and what's what's other variables

644
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
and what's what's other variables
 

645
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,829
and what's what's other variables
what's other

646
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
what's other
 

647
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,509
what's other
values the other values come on what's

648
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
values the other values come on what's
 

649
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,150
values the other values come on what's
the aloe vera we initialize too

650
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
the aloe vera we initialize too
 

651
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,550
the aloe vera we initialize too
where's one what what do you mean

652
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
where's one what what do you mean
 

653
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,750
where's one what what do you mean
four

654
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
four
 

655
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,990
four
no n equals four so this is four times

656
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
no n equals four so this is four times
 

657
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,190
no n equals four so this is four times
four metric

658
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
four metric
 

659
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,910
four metric
and i i is zero and what's allah's value

660
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
and i i is zero and what's allah's value
 

661
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,870
and i i is zero and what's allah's value
come on

662
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
come on

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
values infinity yeah very big okay you
 

667
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,430
values infinity yeah very big okay you
know how to represent the infinity in

668
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
know how to represent the infinity in
 

669
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,269
know how to represent the infinity in
mathematics

670
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
mathematics
 

671
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,590
mathematics
in mathematics you know how to

672
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
in mathematics you know how to
 

673
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,910
in mathematics you know how to
represent infinity what's the symbol

674
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920

 

675
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,670

yeah yeah yeah look number a by

676
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
yeah yeah yeah look number a by
 

677
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,910
yeah yeah yeah look number a by
horizontal this is infinity yeah ryan

678
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:25,920
horizontal this is infinity yeah ryan
 

679
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,230
horizontal this is infinity yeah ryan
yeah if you look it that way it's a but

680
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
yeah if you look it that way it's a but
 

681
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,470
yeah if you look it that way it's a but
if you put it horizontally means

682
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
if you put it horizontally means
 

683
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,829
if you put it horizontally means
infinity

684
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
infinity
 

685
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,949
infinity
and beyond okay infinity the largest

686
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
and beyond okay infinity the largest
 

687
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,829
and beyond okay infinity the largest
number

688
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
number
 

689
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,230
number
okay is infinity okay infinity

690
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
okay is infinity okay infinity
 

691
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,430

okay
 

693
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,629
okay
okay so we have this the magic right so

694
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
okay so we have this the magic right so
 

695
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,590
okay so we have this the magic right so
this i to i for example what's this

696
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
this i to i for example what's this
 

697
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,790
this i to i for example what's this
value mean

698
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
value mean
 

699
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,550
value mean
what's this environment

700
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,560
what's this environment
 

701
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,509
what's this environment
no no no what's this value if this is uh

702
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
no no no what's this value if this is uh
 

703
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,350
no no no what's this value if this is uh
okay if this is one

704
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
okay if this is one
 

705
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,269
okay if this is one
what does it mean

706
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
what does it mean
 

707
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,350
what does it mean
if this is one what does it mean

708
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
if this is one what does it mean
 

709
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,110
if this is one what does it mean
the second row

710
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
the second row
 

711
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,550
the second row
first column

712
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
first column
 

713
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,870
first column
so how do we lose zen in here is this

714
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
so how do we lose zen in here is this
 

715
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,050
so how do we lose zen in here is this
zero one

716
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,060
zero one
 

717
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,230

what i mean okay another one
what's the if this is two what does it

738
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
what's the if this is two what does it
 

739
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,910
what's the if this is two what does it
mean

740
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
mean
 

741
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,269
mean
this

742

zero one
and what's this zero one two

746
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
and what's this zero one two
 

747
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,990
and what's this zero one two
what does it mean if this is two what

748
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
what does it mean if this is two what
 

749
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,110
what does it mean if this is two what
does it mean

750
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120

 

751
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,350

if this is two what does the mean what

752
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
if this is two what does the mean what
 

753
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,550
if this is two what does the mean what
do we want

754
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
do we want
 

755
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,629
do we want
the distance between which two nouns

756
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639

 

757
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,030

one and two that's it yeah so this time

758
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
one and two that's it yeah so this time
 

759
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,629
one and two that's it yeah so this time
a b means that

760
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
a b means that
 

761
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,389
a b means that
the shortest distance between

762
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
the shortest distance between
 

763
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,670
the shortest distance between
a to b is here right correct that's what

764
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
a to b is here right correct that's what
 

765
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,189
a to b is here right correct that's what
it means

766
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:03,199
it means
 

767
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,590
it means
okay so now given these

768
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
okay so now given these
 

769
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,269
okay so now given these
so

770
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
so
 

771
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,509
so
what else we just need to

772
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:09,519
what else we just need to
 

773
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,430
what else we just need to
do this for k

774
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
do this for k
 

775
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,710
do this for k
in

776
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
in
 

777
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,389

range

778
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399

n
 

781
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,030
n
okay so another another for 4

782
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
okay so another another for 4
 

783
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,990
okay so another another for 4
i

784
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000

range
 

789
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,550
range
and this is easy to understand later

790
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
and this is easy to understand later
 

791
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,150
and this is easy to understand later
okay and then another four j in

792
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
okay and then another four j in
 

793
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,990
okay and then another four j in
range

794
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
range
 

795
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,110
range
and

796
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
and
 

797
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,110
and
so what's the time complexity if we

798
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
so what's the time complexity if we
 

799
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,590
so what's the time complexity if we
drive the three loops

800
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
drive the three loops
 

801
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,110
drive the three loops
what's the time complexity if we write

802
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
what's the time complexity if we write
 

803
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,870
what's the time complexity if we write
the three rows

804
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
the three rows
 

805
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:46,389
the three rows
so

806
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399

 

807
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,230

sorry

808
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240

 

809
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,829

oh

810
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839

 

811
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,550

this is n this is n this is o and three

812
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
this is n this is n this is o and three
 

813
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,710
this is n this is n this is o and three
yeah o and q b

814
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
yeah o and q b
 

815
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,949
yeah o and q b
okay i will keep it okay

816
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
okay i will keep it okay
 

817
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,189
okay i will keep it okay
okay so we we we given this graph okay

818
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
okay so we we we given this graph okay
 

819
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,150
okay so we we we given this graph okay
but we haven't this graph uh

820
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160

 

821
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,670

a to b

822
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
a to b
 

823
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,310
a to b
and then wait okay so first of all we

824
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320
and then wait okay so first of all we
 

825
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,310
and then wait okay so first of all we
need to update this okay

826
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
need to update this okay
 

827
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,509
need to update this okay
so i write here we forgot here

828
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
so i write here we forgot here
 

829
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,629
so i write here we forgot here
okay

830
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
okay
 

831
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,110
okay
is that for

832
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
is that for
 

833
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,990
is that for
a

834
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000

weight in g
 

839
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,310
weight in g
for a b y in g and then we update this

840
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
for a b y in g and then we update this
 

841
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,150
for a b y in g and then we update this
distance

842
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
distance
 

843
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,150

yeah this is the up uh to handling the

850
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
yeah this is the up uh to handling the
 

851
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,910
yeah this is the up uh to handling the
up uh

852
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
up uh
 

853
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,870

uh
 

855
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,910
uh
handling the input all right hey

856
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
handling the input all right hey

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,430
vertex b
cos the w right so we put it in this

864
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
cos the w right so we put it in this
 

865
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,829
cos the w right so we put it in this
magic yeah we put it in this measure a

866
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
magic yeah we put it in this measure a
 

867
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,310
magic yeah we put it in this measure a
to b w okay so now

868
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320
to b w okay so now
 

869
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,069
to b w okay so now
look

870
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
look
 

871
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,509
look
if

872
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
if
 

873
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,630
if
okay so look if the note okay this is i

874
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,640
okay so look if the note okay this is i
 

875
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,110
okay so look if the note okay this is i
node yeah this is i node

876
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
node yeah this is i node
 

877
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,350
node yeah this is i node
and this is j node

878
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360
and this is j node
 

879
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,909
and this is j node
right what's the what's the distance

880
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
right what's the what's the distance
 

881
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,990
right what's the what's the distance
between what's the current distance

882
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
between what's the current distance
 

883
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,350
between what's the current distance
between i to j how can we represent it

884
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
between i to j how can we represent it
 

885
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,150
between i to j how can we represent it
all right how can we represent it

886
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160

 

887
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,630

how can we represent that

888
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
how can we represent that
 

889
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,870
how can we represent that
okay ryan come on what's the distance

890
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
okay ryan come on what's the distance
 

891
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:44,950
okay ryan come on what's the distance
between i to j

892
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960

 

893
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,510

will be the minimum of what if this if

894
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
will be the minimum of what if this if
 

895
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,549
will be the minimum of what if this if
we found another one this i to j okay

896
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
we found another one this i to j okay
 

897
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,909
we found another one this i to j okay
right here

898
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
right here
 

899
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,390
right here
but if we found this k here

900
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
but if we found this k here
 

901
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,350
but if we found this k here
yeah

902
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
yeah
 

903
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,190
yeah
this is k here

904
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
this is k here
 

905
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,510
this is k here
if we found this what's the distance

906
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
if we found this what's the distance
 

907
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,870
if we found this what's the distance
between uh for i to k and k to j

908
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
between uh for i to k and k to j
 

909
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,470
between uh for i to k and k to j
come on

910
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
come on
 

911
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,830
come on
we know the i to j current a i to j is

912
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:11,840
we know the i to j current a i to j is
 

913
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,190
we know the i to j current a i to j is
this

914
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
this
 

915
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,270
this
i say right

916
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
i say right
 

917
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,630
i say right
yeah

918
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640
yeah
 

919
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,870
yeah
what's the distance between i to k

920
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880

 

921
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,510

this i k right

922
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
this i k right
 

923
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,669
this i k right
what's the distance between k to z

924
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:26,679
what's the distance between k to z
 

925
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,669
what's the distance between k to z
okay today yeah this casey

926
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679

 

927
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,470

so

928
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
so
 

929
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,150
so
so how can i write this if this is a

930
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,160
so how can i write this if this is a
 

931
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,350
so how can i write this if this is a
is

932
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
is
 

933
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,830
is
look if this ik

934
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
look if this ik
 

935
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,909
look if this ik
look if this ik plus this kj come on

936
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
look if this ik plus this kj come on
 

937
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,750
look if this ik plus this kj come on
it's smaller than what we have

938
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
it's smaller than what we have
 

939
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,029
it's smaller than what we have
[Music]

940
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:49,039

 

941
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,430

yeah if this bit plus this bit is more

942
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
yeah if this bit plus this bit is more
 

943
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,870
yeah if this bit plus this bit is more
than any speed so we update this bit to

944
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
than any speed so we update this bit to
 

945
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,990
than any speed so we update this bit to
this b plus this b correct

946
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
this b plus this b correct
 

947
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,350
this b plus this b correct
yeah

948
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
yeah
 

949
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,750
yeah
so we can write using the mean so what

950
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:01,760
so we can write using the mean so what
 

951
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,710
so we can write using the mean so what
should i put here is this what

952
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
should i put here is this what
 

953
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,270
should i put here is this what
i k

954
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
i k
 

955
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,630
i k
plus

956
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
plus
 

957
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,150
plus
t square

958
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160

 

959
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,789

j is bigger than

960
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
j is bigger than
 

961
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,390
j is bigger than
i to k and plus k to j so

962
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
i to k and plus k to j so
 

963
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,870
i to k and plus k to j so
j yeah that's it so look we use the mean

964
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:22,880
j yeah that's it so look we use the mean
 

965
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,270
j yeah that's it so look we use the mean
function but it's the same as look is

966
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
function but it's the same as look is
 

967
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,470
function but it's the same as look is
this is similar as one if this

968
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:28,480
this is similar as one if this
 

969
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,270
this is similar as one if this
if this i k plus this k k j is smaller

970
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
if this i k plus this k k j is smaller
 

971
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,230
if this i k plus this k k j is smaller
than this i j what does it mean it means

972
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
than this i j what does it mean it means
 

973
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,110
than this i j what does it mean it means
that we can use this path to replace the

974
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,120
that we can use this path to replace the
 

975
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,430
that we can use this path to replace the
the path between i to j right that's why

976
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
the path between i to j right that's why
 

977
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,669
the path between i to j right that's why
exactly what they mean okay

978
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
exactly what they mean okay
 

979
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,310
exactly what they mean okay
and the distance between

980
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
and the distance between
 

981
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,789
and the distance between
if we given a star the distance the

982
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
if we given a star the distance the
 

983
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,350
if we given a star the distance the
distance between after this the distance

984
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
distance between after this the distance
 

985
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,470
distance between after this the distance
the shortest distance between zero

986
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
the shortest distance between zero
 

987
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,510
the shortest distance between zero
to all the nodes will be in this is in

988
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
to all the nodes will be in this is in
 

989
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,750
to all the nodes will be in this is in
in this this zero okay that's it

990
00:19:59,750 --> 00:19:59,760
in this this zero okay that's it
 

991
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,149
in this this zero okay that's it
zero one zero two zero okay what's the

992
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
zero one zero two zero okay what's the
 

993
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,990
zero one zero two zero okay what's the
time complexity for this one have you

994
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
time complexity for this one have you
 

995
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,310
time complexity for this one have you
mentioned have we mentioned

996
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320

 

997

are we using any space
 

1009
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:29,270
are we using any space
oh are we using any space what's this

1010

this is two dimensional how many if n is

1012
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
this is two dimensional how many if n is
 

1013
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,750
this is two dimensional how many if n is
four nodes how many remember we talked

1014
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:33,760
four nodes how many remember we talked
 

1015
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,230
four nodes how many remember we talked
about this we have this what's that this

1016
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
about this we have this what's that this
 

1017
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,669
about this we have this what's that this
space if n is four you have how many or

1018
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
space if n is four you have how many or
 

1019
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,190
space if n is four you have how many or
one

1020
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,200
one
 

1021
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,830
one
i'm using any space come on what if n is

1022
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
i'm using any space come on what if n is
 

1023
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,470
i'm using any space come on what if n is
four how many units are there how many

1024
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
four how many units are there how many
 

1025
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,350
four how many units are there how many
so what's left it's n square oh n square

1026
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:49,360
so what's left it's n square oh n square
 

1027
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,830
so what's left it's n square oh n square
come on yeah i want the square

1028
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
come on yeah i want the square
 

1029
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,029
come on yeah i want the square
okay

1030
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
okay
 

1031
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,549

yeah
okay i'm going to erase this bit okay

1034
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
okay i'm going to erase this bit okay
 

1035
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,310
okay i'm going to erase this bit okay
y

1036
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320
y
 

1037
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,270
y
that's it

1038

this
 

1047
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,149
this
so this is i

1048
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
so this is i
 

1049
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,390
so this is i
to j we want to up we want to update i

1050
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
to j we want to up we want to update i
 

1051
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,950
to j we want to up we want to update i
to j but now it's a k if there is a path

1052
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
to j but now it's a k if there is a path
 

1053
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,390
to j but now it's a k if there is a path
i to k

1054
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
i to k
 

1055
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,110
i to k
i to k k to j

1056
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
i to k k to j
 

1057
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,070
i to k k to j

00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:30,159

 

1181
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,710

it means that

1182
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:32,720
it means that
 

1183
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,990
it means that
there's

1184
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
there's
 

1185
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,390
there's
is there a path between

1186
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,400
is there a path between
 

1187
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,310
is there a path between
there is no path right if there is no

1188
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
there is no path right if there is no
 

1189
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,789
there is no path right if there is no
path then the value will be still

1190
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
path then the value will be still
 

1191
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,669
path then the value will be still
master infinity because if let's pass

1192
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
master infinity because if let's pass
 

1193
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,750
master infinity because if let's pass
right anything compares to master

1194
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
right anything compares to master
 

1195
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,230
right anything compares to master
infinity will be

1196
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
infinity will be
 

1197
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,470
infinity will be
will be updated right right if it's not

1198
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
will be updated right right if it's not
 

1199
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,950
will be updated right right if it's not
updated if it's not updated because the

1200
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
updated if it's not updated because the
 

1201
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,789
updated if it's not updated because the
the value at the beginning yeah except

1202
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
the value at the beginning yeah except
 

1203
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,310
the value at the beginning yeah except
this time node

1204
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
this time node
 

1205
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,310
this time node
it said this time all other values are

1206
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,320
it said this time all other values are
 

1207
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,149
it said this time all other values are
messed up infinity if this value is not

1208
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:00,159
messed up infinity if this value is not
 

1209
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,669
messed up infinity if this value is not
updated what does it mean there is no

1210
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
updated what does it mean there is no
 

1211
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,029
updated what does it mean there is no
path between

1212
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,039
path between
 

1213
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,350
path between
the two vertex right you can separate

1214
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
the two vertex right you can separate
 

1215
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,590
the two vertex right you can separate
right so you will not be updated so and

1216
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
right so you will not be updated so and
 

1217
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,310
right so you will not be updated so and
lastly will be the master infinity okay

1218
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
lastly will be the master infinity okay
 

1219
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,789
lastly will be the master infinity okay
okay that's it for today good job

1220
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
okay that's it for today good job
 

1221
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,120
okay that's it for today good job
say bye bye
