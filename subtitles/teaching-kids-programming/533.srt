1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:13,080
you have two meetings today right like

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,120
uh from uh today yeah from one to one

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,000
o'clock you didn't really have a meeting

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,260
two o'clock okay and then I have another

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,980
meeting like say I have another meeting

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:28,199
once uh to three o'clock so are these

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,599
two meetings having a comfort so you

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,719
have to do two at a time so you want to

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,600
cook so one o'clock

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,500
ah okay okay so the question is that

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,079
even though two times two events we want

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,360
to find out if they have this conflict

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,420
the conflict saying that at the moment

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,260
that we need to attend the

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,600
United needs to attend to meetings so in

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,199
other words we're asking if there's an

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,379
intersection between these two terms

18
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:04,379
if we go a multitask

19
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:08,280
okay so yes yes look beef with product

20
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,220
on the timeline timeline yeah right look

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,180
one o'clock here one o'clock

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,180
to two o'clock

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,560
and 130 is here 130

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,220
to 3 o'clock

25
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,780
okay so look

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,060
the first bit is this bit the second

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,259
event is here all right so we have a

28
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,600
overlap

29
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,119
so we have an overlap

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,640
then it means that

31
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,640
we have uh conflicts okay

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,500
okay so the question is simple given to

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,720
Time Event

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:58,340
uh yeah well

35
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,340
even zero for example

36
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:07,640
and zero two zero zero star and and E1

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,640
even one is zero one two three

38
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:16,020
o'clock man will return yes there is a

39
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:19,140
conflict otherwise uh we return sauce

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,540
so another special case is that the if

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,239
the second event is from two to three we

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,040
still think it has conflict right

43
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,959
because at two o'clock at the moment of

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,180
two o'clock there are two events

45
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,440
inclusive am I right

46
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,420
okay so what's your thoughts

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,739
um

48
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:42,319
the later one and the the start of the

49
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:46,040
later one

50
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:51,300
which is one the star of the later one

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:54,840
is which is 130 if if it's before the

52
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,780
end of the first one it's it's dead

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,519
overlap but not necessarily okay that's

54
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,220
a very good stuff okay how about look

55
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,739
how about you see this is uh is before

56
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,480
this yeah all right but how about you

57
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,700
for the entire thing moves like

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,900
basically it's still before that

59
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,900
but there's no overlap

60
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,400
it doesn't make sense yeah so how I mean

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,879
[Music]

62
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,580
today change it to the early one

63
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,920
if you remove a hole in shift to the

64
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,739
beginning that makes it the early one

65
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,140
nobody okay yeah that's another thing

66
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,180
okay

67
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,739
so you're seeing the later one so so

68
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,220
first of all the later one what's the

69
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:44,840
later one so let's start

70
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,840
needs to be bigger than this right

71
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,299
the Earth

72
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:00,540
so what how do you define the later one

73
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,500
what's uh what's later what uh it's the

74
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,940
one

75
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,319
the one with

76
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,299
uh

77
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,860
what do you know which one is later what

78
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,860
how do you know which one is better one

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,079
is bigger than that right and this is

80
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:24,120
smaller than that right then then yes

81
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
yes and and you need to do the opposite

82
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,460
as well right because there are two

83
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,680
cases

84
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,020
if this is the later one

85
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,240
so if this is bigger than that and

86
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,520
smaller than that right yeah that could

87
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,000
work okay

88
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,820
yeah that's good okay so how about that

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,340
if we think differently like what's the

90
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:48,380
opposite what's the opposite of overlap

91
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,380
let's conflict what's the opposite

92
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,300
okay so look look

93
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,240
if you look what's the opposite how many

94
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,820
situations of our left look yeah this is

95
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,100
a right and then another one B so it

96
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,440
could be something like that right

97
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,680
this is one case and what's the other

98
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,680
case

99
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,979
this is a what's the other case not

100
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,160
overlapping

101
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:25,400
uh the B to the right okay

102
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,400
okay

103
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,940
so this is the second this is the first

104
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,020
event this is the second if the second

105
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,240
event

106
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,259
if the end of the second event before

107
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:40,500
the start of the first season oh

108
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:43,380
oh evil star of the second event right

109
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,940
is bigger than the end of the first

110
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,580
event then we don't have the overlap

111
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,919
right please cover us all the cases when

112
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,620
the two events no not overlapping not

113
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,300
having a conflict and the opposite

114
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,120
not

115
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,120
or not

116
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,759
not overlapping so what's this

117
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,820
not not of anything that becomes

118
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,039
overlapping yeah okay so yeah very

119
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:12,840
simple okay and given the time we can

120
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:16,680
just do Lisa so uh if a b equals uh easy

121
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:21,360
to give at least time two times uh

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:24,840
uh A1 A2 okay and then B1 B2 okay E1 and

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:31,740
then we can say so this is the A1 this

124
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:33,780
is A2 this is P1 this is P2 A1 A2 B1 B2

125
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,680
then we can say

126
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,139
uh return not okay parenthesis B2

127
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,460
smaller than A1

128
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,460
or

129
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,280
P1 bigger than A2 right and that's it

130
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,560
right so this is one wave and then your

131
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,940
waist is good another way another way is

132
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,759
that we can compare if the maximum look

133
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,819
if the maximum of the starting point

134
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:03,479
right if the maximum of starting point

135
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:06,180
is lower than uh

136
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:09,840
if the maximum of a starting point right

137
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,840
starting point is A1 B1

138
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,580
okay is smaller or equal and the minimum

139
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:20,699
of the ending point which is A2 B2 okay

140
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,639
yeah look nice yeah look at these two

141
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:25,139
the starting the maximum of a starting

142
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,340
point is this one

143
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:29,099
but

144
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,380
minimum of ending point is this one so

145
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:33,180
this is smaller than that it has that

146
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,740
overlap okay let's look at the not

147
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,740
overlapping

148
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,020
the maximum of starting point is least

149
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,539
one the minimum number ending point is

150
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,300
here so it doesn't satisfy so let's not

151
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:47,639
overlapping another one

152
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,280
the maximum of starting point is this

153
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,919
one the minimum ending point is this one

154
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,780
so starting form is bigger than the

155
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,199
ending point so let's not overlapping

156
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:01,680
but if the maximum of starting point is

157
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,479
smaller than the minimum of the smaller

158
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,880
equivalent minimum and important we have

159
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:08,099
overlay okay think the opposite okay

160
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,220
let's look at this another new problem

161
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:14,039
okay given to a rectangle

162
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,660
yeah look given to two rectangular just

163
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:19,199
horizontal rectangle

164
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,879
how do we know if laser overlap come on

165
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,340
look we you know there are four

166
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,500
coordinates you know love coordinates

167
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,620
yeah you know each coordinate how do we

168
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,620
know

169
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:35,839
one of the coordinates must be like in

170
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:40,080
if like

171
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,240
in in the upper rectangle yeah but how

172
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,240
like many many situations look this is

173
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,160
also you know overlapping this is also

174
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,959
uh overlapping there are many many

175
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,360
situations but how do we know how do we

176
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,220
approve us all kinds of situations that

177
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,140
we are sure the two rectangles

178
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,019
overlapping you know just horizontal

179
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:01,200
right horizontal if they hear another

180
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:03,620
rectangle yeah how how do we check what

181
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,620
did I just say

182
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,399
what's the opposite

183
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:14,210
what's the opposite of tool and tankers

184
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:17,379
overlapping two rectangles

185
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,379
[Music]

186
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,440
so what's the opposite so look look

187
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,399
what's the opposite two squares look

188
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,860
here

189
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,660
so this is the first first rectangle

190
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,940
right that's it and what's the second

191
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,279
rectangle that is not overlapping

192
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,800
so what could be you could be here

193
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,440
it could be here okay can you click here

194
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,660
it could be here it could be on Jupiter

195
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,160
okay

196
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,620
there are only 400 situations when they

197
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,440
are not overlapping why look it's a path

198
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,120
at the top so it's it's uh it's

199
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,580
somewhere here right it's somewhere here

200
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,640
so it could be somewhere here right you

201
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,640
know

202
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,640
could be here

203
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:06,000
yeah yeah it could be here right

204
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:08,640
and then below below the bottom bottom

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,320
uh border so you could be here right and

206
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,100
then on the right of the Whiteboard

207
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,920
right yeah so these are the fourth

208
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,339
situation the covers all the cases that

209
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:23,000
the second rectangle

210
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:26,160
overlaps the first one right

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,200
no no no no no I'm saying overlapping

212
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,399
with this one these are just some

213
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,399
examples okay

214
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,080
all right so what's the opposite then

215
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,240
it's overlapping right so we just have

216
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,160
to check because this is easier to check

217
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,440
right I can just check and look at this

218
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,899
this is the y-axis is lower than the

219
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,180
length of up above the left the excess

220
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,820
is on the left or on the right it's

221
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,700
easier to check if these two rectangles

222
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,160
if they don't overlap then the opposite

223
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,620
then that will be overlapping okay yeah

224
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,720
so today's question the two events two

225
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,000
interval yeah this is basically asking

226
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,680
if two interval time overlapping and I

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,540
think we covered that slightly in the

228
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,120
previous lessons right so I'm not even

229
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,040
like two intervals overlapping so the

230
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,540
easiest way would be to check if they

231
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,820
are not overlapping because it's quite

232
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,040
easy to check if you're not overlapping

233
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,740
they're just two cases right so one is

234
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,600
the second one is totally on the left or

235
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,300
totally on the right and we just have to

236
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,339
be negat let's check then we'll be

237
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,540
overlapping them right okay so back to

238
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:31,680
you what have you learned today and

239
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:34,200
that's it oh I learned about oh uh

240
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,279
determining how two events have conflict

241
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:42,120
if if they if two like

242
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:44,880
um meetings meetings like overlap and so

243
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,200
you have the multitask or movies yeah

244
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,200
okay oh yeah

245
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,959
and so

246
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:02,700
the way we do it is for example like

247
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,820
my way is like

248
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,820
um

249
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:13,740
the beginning of uh later one I was like

250
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,880
two um uh to uh no believe one is let's

251
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,880
start over

252
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
approach

253
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:36,380
[Music]

254
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:40,500
you approaches like using the

255
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:42,360
coordinates like the olive that is over

256
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,660
there and that is over there and if

257
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,060
that's over the that one then it's a

258
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,760
month overlap the opposite of not

259
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,260
overlapping okay and it's the same thing

260
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,380
as checking if two like tenders

261
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,660
overlapping so sometimes uh today's key

262
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,660
takeaways sometimes it's easier to check

263
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,399
the opposite

264
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,920
that we can get we can make it Opposite

265
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,980
then double negative means positive all

266
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,600
right right not not overlapping is

267
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,079
overlapping okay Ryan what's your

268
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,079
favorite place

269
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:21,240
um so you have this event yeah it could

270
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,560
be anything yeah like eating apples and

271
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,560
watching movies okay

272
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,019
um

273
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:33,240
Ryan please

274
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,720
so what while we're trying to find out

275
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,720
there

276
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,440
is

277
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,779
overlapping intercession okay and then

278
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,579
how are we doing it how do we check it

279
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,120
what's

280
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:47,639
um

281
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,500
yeah so can you be more specific if they

282
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,440
pass the rectangle

283
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,300
no I'm talking about the events the the

284
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,800
interviews

285
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,680
how do you check if there are two

286
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,540
intervals on the line overlapping not at

287
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,540
least two universe

288
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,420
highlight overlapping if they talk to

289
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,480
each other yeah but how

290
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:13,100
what's the opposite of not overlapping

291
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,620
what's the opposite of overlapping so

292
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:19,260
this is not overlapping this is not

293
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,360
overlapping the only two right

294
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,040
so we can check if they are not

295
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,600
overlapping and we make the opposite

296
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,940
then that's overlapping all right

297
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,600
because there are more situations of

298
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,639
more scenarios of of

299
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,100
overlapping right what's that okay a

300
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,200
caterpillar

301
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,200
okay that's it for today bye bye
