00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,230

yeah okay and then we have released the

176
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
yeah okay and then we have released the
 

177
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,550
yeah okay and then we have released the
first search another defined

178
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
first search another defined
 

179
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,749
first search another defined
do you define it

180
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
do you define it
 

181
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,909
do you define it
what should we pass the the second

182
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
what should we pass the the second
 

183
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,710
what should we pass the the second
parameter

184
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720

 

185
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,110

uh if we want to travel let's go to the

186
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
uh if we want to travel let's go to the
 

187
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,430
uh if we want to travel let's go to the
left which we should what

188
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
left which we should what
 

189
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,550
left which we should what
plus one yeah yeah we should have at

190
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
plus one yeah yeah we should have at
 

191
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,990
plus one yeah yeah we should have at
least x variable two

192
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
least x variable two
 

193
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,189
least x variable two
horizontal variable yeah why is it x or

194
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
horizontal variable yeah why is it x or
 

195
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,390
horizontal variable yeah why is it x or
any variable

196
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
any variable
 

197
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,230
any variable
you can name it oh you could x because

198
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
you can name it oh you could x because
 

199
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,070
you can name it oh you could x because
look usually

200
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
look usually
 

201
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,550
look usually
usually in a mathematic this is x this

202
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
usually in a mathematic this is x this
 

203
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,670
usually in a mathematic this is x this
is y right

204
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
is y right
 

205
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,950
is y right
this is the horizontal y right

206
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
this is the horizontal y right
 

207
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,950
this is the horizontal y right
why is this one horizontal but we're

208
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
why is this one horizontal but we're
 

209
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,070
why is this one horizontal but we're
going to left left left

210
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
going to left left left
 

211
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,590
going to left left left
right this is x right all right

212
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
right this is x right all right
 

213
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,550
right this is x right all right
so in order to do this all right we have

214
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
so in order to do this all right we have
 

215
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,189
so in order to do this all right we have
a

216
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
a
 

217
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,430
a
line to which stored unique data which

218
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
line to which stored unique data which
 

219
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,790
line to which stored unique data which
what's your opinion eagles

220
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
what's your opinion eagles
 

221
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,150
what's your opinion eagles
set said yeah yeah and

222
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
set said yeah yeah and
 

223
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,469
set said yeah yeah and
we want to we want to manipulate the

224
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
we want to we want to manipulate the
 

225
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,230
we want to we want to manipulate the
land inside this fashion so we need to

226
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
land inside this fashion so we need to
 

227
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,270
land inside this fashion so we need to
decorate

228
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
decorate
 

229
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,990
decorate
non-local okay none of the land not like

230
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
non-local okay none of the land not like
 

231
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,590
non-local okay none of the land not like
and then we should do this one if

232
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
and then we should do this one if
 

233
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,150
and then we should do this one if
not if not those

234
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160

 

235
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,670

yeah because if it's empty we don't

236
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
yeah because if it's empty we don't
 

237
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,309
yeah because if it's empty we don't
return and then we need to put the

238
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
return and then we need to put the
 

239
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,909
return and then we need to put the
lines in to add x

240
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
lines in to add x
 

241
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,430
lines in to add x
yeah what does it mean what does that

242
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
yeah what does it mean what does that
 

243
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,110
yeah what does it mean what does that
mean

244
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
mean
 

245
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,230
mean
the x is current horizontal horizontal

246
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
the x is current horizontal horizontal
 

247
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,350
the x is current horizontal horizontal
uh okay the lines uh

248
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
uh okay the lines uh
 

249
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,870
uh okay the lines uh
you know the horizontal yeah i mean

250
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
you know the horizontal yeah i mean
 

251
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,309
you know the horizontal yeah i mean
yeah uh yeah so so look what this is one

252
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
yeah uh yeah so so look what this is one
 

253
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,510
yeah uh yeah so so look what this is one
two three so we push this is zero yeah

254
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
two three so we push this is zero yeah
 

255
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,029
two three so we push this is zero yeah
at the beginning you know push it into

256
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
at the beginning you know push it into
 

257
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,590
at the beginning you know push it into
the lens and then we need to do it

258
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
the lens and then we need to do it
 

259
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,430
the lens and then we need to do it
definitely

260
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
yeah and then we need to return
 

275
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,990
