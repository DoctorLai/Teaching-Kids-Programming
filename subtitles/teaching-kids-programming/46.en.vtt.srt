00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480

 

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,910

yes good job

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
yes good job
 

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,950
yes good job
remember we talk about binary search

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
remember we talk about binary search
 

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,550
remember we talk about binary search
right yeah

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560

 

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,950

what what is what what's that

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960

 

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,390

binary is two yeah so every time you cut

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
binary is two yeah so every time you cut
 

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,070
binary is two yeah so every time you cut
the search space into half

14
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
the search space into half
 

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,110
the search space into half
for example i give you a number i i i'm

16
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
for example i give you a number i i i'm
 

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,590
for example i give you a number i i i'm
i'm thinking of a lumber yeah in my head

18
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
i'm thinking of a lumber yeah in my head
 

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,150
i'm thinking of a lumber yeah in my head
i tell you it's between 0 to 100 okay

20
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
i tell you it's between 0 to 100 okay
 

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,350
i tell you it's between 0 to 100 okay
tell me what it is just pay again 50.

22
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
tell me what it is just pay again 50.
 

23
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,389
tell me what it is just pay again 50.
it's bigger than i what i saw

24
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:46,399

 

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,069

okay so you guys keep guessing

26
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
okay so you guys keep guessing
 

27
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,750
okay so you guys keep guessing
keep guessing ryan says 50. i said it's

28
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
keep guessing ryan says 50. i said it's
 

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,670
keep guessing ryan says 50. i said it's
smaller it's bigger than

30
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
smaller it's bigger than
 

31
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,630
smaller it's bigger than
the number i in my mind so what's that 6

32
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
the number i in my mind so what's that 6
 

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,910
the number i in my mind so what's that 6
22

34
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
22
 

35
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,750
22
22 you guessed 22 yeah it's smaller than

36
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
22 you guessed 22 yeah it's smaller than
 

37
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,550
22 you guessed 22 yeah it's smaller than
what i think three

38
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560

 

39
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,429

small this number is smaller so it is in

40
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
small this number is smaller so it is in
 

41
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,109
small this number is smaller so it is in
this range

42
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119

 

43
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,390

36 36 is smaller

44
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400

 

45
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,429

uh 27

46
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
uh 27
 

47
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,149
uh 27
it's smaller so you need to it's in this

48
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
it's smaller so you need to it's in this
 

49
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:26,550
it's smaller so you need to it's in this
right

50
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
right
 

51
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,830
right
49 five nine it's bigger

52
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:34,840

 

53
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,030

46 46 is bigger

54
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
46 46 is bigger
 

55
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,030
46 46 is bigger
48 46 is bigger so

56
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
48 46 is bigger so
 

57
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,429
48 46 is bigger so
4.85 it's still bigger

58
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
4.85 it's still bigger
 

59
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,950
4.85 it's still bigger
uh 39 yes whether yeah that's the number

60
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
uh 39 yes whether yeah that's the number
 

61
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,590
uh 39 yes whether yeah that's the number
i guess

62
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
i guess
 

63
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,830
i guess
so basically you cut into half so when i

64
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:53,840
so basically you cut into half so when i
 

65
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,190
so basically you cut into half so when i
say 50

66
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
say 50
 

67
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,510
say 50
is bigger than you you know it's in this

68
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
is bigger than you you know it's in this
 

69
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,550
is bigger than you you know it's in this
way right yeah

70
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:58,560
way right yeah
 

71
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,109
way right yeah
then it's it's and every time you cut

72
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
then it's it's and every time you cut
 

73
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,590
then it's it's and every time you cut
into high so the next number is 25

74
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
into high so the next number is 25
 

75
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,069
into high so the next number is 25
yeah and it says it's smaller so you

76
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
yeah and it says it's smaller so you
 

77
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,030
yeah and it says it's smaller so you
know it's between

78
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
know it's between
 

79
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,630
know it's between
24 25 and 50 right and then you search

80
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
24 25 and 50 right and then you search
 

81
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,990
24 25 and 50 right and then you search
in the middle which is

82
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
in the middle which is
 

83
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,830
in the middle which is
i don't know it's it's 38 maybe

84
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
i don't know it's it's 38 maybe
 

85
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,630
i don't know it's it's 38 maybe
yeah yeah 38 roughly yeah in the middle

86
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
yeah yeah 38 roughly yeah in the middle
 

87
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,990
yeah yeah 38 roughly yeah in the middle
i say it's smaller

88
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
i say it's smaller
 

89
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,990
i say it's smaller
then you even know it's between 38 and

90
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
then you even know it's between 38 and
 

91
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,270
then you even know it's between 38 and
50 and then you do this

92
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
50 and then you do this
 

93
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,430
50 and then you do this
every time you you pick a remainder and

94
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
every time you you pick a remainder and
 

95
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,550
every time you you pick a remainder and
you ask me

96
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
you ask me
 

97
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,350
you ask me
yeah if i say bigger then you know it's

98
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
yeah if i say bigger then you know it's
 

99
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,710
yeah if i say bigger then you know it's
in a smaller half

100
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
in a smaller half
 

101
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,550
in a smaller half
if i say smaller you know it's in a

102
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
if i say smaller you know it's in a
 

103
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,830
if i say smaller you know it's in a
bigger half right

104
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
bigger half right
 

105
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,100
bigger half right
so the complexity is usually what

106
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,110
so the complexity is usually what
 

107
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,270
so the complexity is usually what
[Music]

108
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
[Music]
 

109
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,670
[Music]
log n right because if the n i every

110
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
log n right because if the n i every
 

111
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,270
log n right because if the n i every
time i kind of half yeah

112
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
time i kind of half yeah
 

113
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,390
time i kind of half yeah
all right so this is log

114
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
all right so this is log
 

115
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,750
all right so this is log
remember log a b

116
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
remember log a b
 

117
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,949
remember log a b
equals x

118
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
equals x
 

119
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,350
equals x
so what does it mean it means a x to the

120
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
so what does it mean it means a x to the
 

121
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,470
so what does it mean it means a x to the
power x equals b

122
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
power x equals b
 

123
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,390
power x equals b
right normally yeah yes yeah okay

124
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
right normally yeah yes yeah okay
 

125
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,190
right normally yeah yes yeah okay
so this log function it's like that

126
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
so this log function it's like that
 

127
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,390
so this log function it's like that
this is x this is y

128
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
this is x this is y
 

129
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,830
this is x this is y
yeah so look uh

130
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
yeah so look uh
 

131
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,949
yeah so look uh
y equals log if i say

132
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
y equals log if i say
 

133
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,630
y equals log if i say
log 2 base 2 okay log base 2x

134
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
log 2 base 2 okay log base 2x
 

135
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,350
log 2 base 2 okay log base 2x
so what does it mean what does it mean

136
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
so what does it mean what does it mean
 

137
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,830
so what does it mean what does it mean
do you know how hard the function goes

138
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
do you know how hard the function goes
 

139
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,430
do you know how hard the function goes
how the function goes

140
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440

 

141
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,550

if x is x if y

142
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
if x is x if y
 

143
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,910
if x is x if y
is 0 so x is 2

144
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
is 0 so x is 2
 

145
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,270
is 0 so x is 2
2 what power equals

146
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
2 what power equals
 

147
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,949
2 what power equals
0

148
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959

 

149
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,229

no it's the other way so if x

150
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
no it's the other way so if x
 

151
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,509
no it's the other way so if x
is 1 uh

152
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
is 1 uh
 

153
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,990
is 1 uh
how can i do it actually actually this

154
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
how can i do it actually actually this
 

155
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,270
how can i do it actually actually this
is not x right

156
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
is not x right
 

157
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,190
is not x right
log two x equals y

158
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
log two x equals y
 

159
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,630
log two x equals y
so y is zero when y is zero

160
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
so y is zero when y is zero
 

161
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,830
so y is zero when y is zero
okay for using no actually actually this

162
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
okay for using no actually actually this
 

163
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,949
okay for using no actually actually this
is

164
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
is
 

165
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,550
is
listen to the opposite okay this is

166
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
listen to the opposite okay this is
 

167
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,149
listen to the opposite okay this is
alright so x

168
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
alright so x
 

169
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,670
alright so x
equals not y okay so when y

170
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
equals not y okay so when y
 

171
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,190
equals not y okay so when y
is zero and well when y is zero

172
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
is zero and well when y is zero
 

173
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,390
is zero and well when y is zero
uh wait wait wait y can't be

174
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
uh wait wait wait y can't be
 

175
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,349
uh wait wait wait y can't be
zero right two to the power of anything

176
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
zero right two to the power of anything
 

177
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,150
zero right two to the power of anything
can't be

178
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
can't be
 

179
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,270
can't be
zero right yeah so yes i was right at

180
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
zero right yeah so yes i was right at
 

181
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,110
zero right yeah so yes i was right at
the beginning

182
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
the beginning
 

183
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,350
the beginning
okay so 2 to the power of

184
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
okay so 2 to the power of
 

185
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,189
okay so 2 to the power of
0 is

186
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
0 is
 

187
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,629
0 is
1 2 power 0

188
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
1 2 power 0
 

189
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,990
1 2 power 0
equals what's this it's one yeah

190
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
equals what's this it's one yeah
 

191
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,270
equals what's this it's one yeah
yeah yeah so x this is x this is one

192
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
yeah yeah so x this is x this is one
 

193
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,469
yeah yeah so x this is x this is one
two to the power of zero is one so

194
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
two to the power of zero is one so
 

195
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,790
two to the power of zero is one so
if i put the zero here this is one yeah

196
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
if i put the zero here this is one yeah
 

197
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,749
if i put the zero here this is one yeah
y is one

198
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
y is one
 

199
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,430
y is one
and x is zero okay yes so

200
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
and x is zero okay yes so
 

201
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,270
and x is zero okay yes so
2 to the power of 1 equals 2 right

202
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
2 to the power of 1 equals 2 right
 

203
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,790
2 to the power of 1 equals 2 right
right 2 to the power of 1 equals 2

204
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
right 2 to the power of 1 equals 2
 

205
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,310
right 2 to the power of 1 equals 2
so 1 y is 1

206
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
so 1 y is 1
 

207
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,430
so 1 y is 1
the x should be 2 right yeah

208
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
the x should be 2 right yeah
 

209
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,390
the x should be 2 right yeah
1y is 1 so x should be 2 2x should be 2

210
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
1y is 1 so x should be 2 2x should be 2
 

211
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,189
1y is 1 so x should be 2 2x should be 2
here

212
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
here
 

213
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,310
here
so basically it's a function like that

214
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
so basically it's a function like that
 

215
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,430
so basically it's a function like that
yeah this is log x okay this is the

216
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
yeah this is log x okay this is the
 

217
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,189
yeah this is log x okay this is the
function of like so you can this is a

218
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
function of like so you can this is a
 

219
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,670
function of like so you can this is a
curve

220
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
curve
 

221
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,430
curve
so what is mean is that the y

222
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
so what is mean is that the y
 

223
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,629
so what is mean is that the y
can be from negative infinity to

224
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
can be from negative infinity to
 

225
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,909
can be from negative infinity to
log to positive infinity yeah

226
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
log to positive infinity yeah
 

227
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,270
log to positive infinity yeah
but x cannot be negative it's always

228
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
but x cannot be negative it's always
 

229
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,990
but x cannot be negative it's always
strictly bigger than zero

230
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
strictly bigger than zero
 

231
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,390
strictly bigger than zero
so you can't find any value 2 to the

232
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
so you can't find any value 2 to the
 

233
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,550
so you can't find any value 2 to the
power of something

234
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
power of something
 

235
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,990
power of something
equals minus something yeah there's no

236
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
equals minus something yeah there's no
 

237
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,749
equals minus something yeah there's no
such number like 2 to the power of

238
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
such number like 2 to the power of
 

239
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,270
such number like 2 to the power of
something equals minus something

240
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
something equals minus something
 

241
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,230
something equals minus something
yeah so that was this means x is

242
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
yeah so that was this means x is
 

243
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,510
yeah so that was this means x is
straight so how can

244
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
straight so how can
 

245
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,830
straight so how can
look this function is we we call it

246
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
look this function is we we call it
 

247
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,870
look this function is we we call it
montana

248
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
montana
 

249
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,070
montana
more monotone function

250
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
more monotone function
 

251
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,950
more monotone function
monotone increasing function what's

252
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
monotone increasing function what's
 

253
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,350
monotone increasing function what's
monoton

254
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
monoton
 

255
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,830
monoton
what's this what mean monotone

256
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840

 

257
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,670

monotone this molar what does it mean

258
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
monotone this molar what does it mean
 

259
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,270
monotone this molar what does it mean
yeah single sound singular

260
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
yeah single sound singular
 

261
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,990
yeah single sound singular
so it means that when x increase y is

262
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
so it means that when x increase y is
 

263
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,390
so it means that when x increase y is
always

264
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
always
 

265
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,749
always
increased so when x is more

266
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
increased so when x is more
 

267
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,309
increased so when x is more
decrease the y is decreased do you get

268
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
decrease the y is decreased do you get
 

269
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,270
decrease the y is decreased do you get
it

270
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
it
 

271
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,309
it
so look what does it mean look

272
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
so look what does it mean look
 

273
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,950
so look what does it mean look
if like somebody's uh how old they are

274
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
if like somebody's uh how old they are
 

275
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,950
if like somebody's uh how old they are
so if i if you don't know this value if

276
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
so if i if you don't know this value if
 

277
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,150
so if i if you don't know this value if
i give you this

278
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
i give you this
 

279
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,150
i give you this
log to a hundred and log to

280
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
log to a hundred and log to
 

281
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,230
log to a hundred and log to
500 which one is bigger this function

282
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
500 which one is bigger this function
 

283
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,749
500 which one is bigger this function
these two value

284
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
these two value
 

285
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,670
these two value
uh the bottom one yeah this is

286
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
uh the bottom one yeah this is
 

287
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,110
uh the bottom one yeah this is
maternally increasing because

288
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
maternally increasing because
 

289
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,790
maternally increasing because
you you don't need to calculate the

290
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
you you don't need to calculate the
 

291
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,510
you you don't need to calculate the
value right because i tell you 500 is

292
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
value right because i tell you 500 is
 

293
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,390
value right because i tell you 500 is
here yeah yeah somewhere here 100 is

294
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
here yeah yeah somewhere here 100 is
 

295
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,350
here yeah yeah somewhere here 100 is
somewhere here yeah

296
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
somewhere here yeah
 

297
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,150
somewhere here yeah
so you compare like you know it's bigger

298
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
so you compare like you know it's bigger
 

299
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,950
so you compare like you know it's bigger
right

300
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
right
 

301
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,029
right
it's somewhere here this is 500

302
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
it's somewhere here this is 500
 

303
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,589
it's somewhere here this is 500
so 500 is somewhere here and then 100 is

304
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
so 500 is somewhere here and then 100 is
 

305
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,550
so 500 is somewhere here and then 100 is
somewhere here

306
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
somewhere here
 

307
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,029
somewhere here
so you look which one is higher this one

308
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
so you look which one is higher this one
 

309
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,270
so you look which one is higher this one
this one is 500 yeah

310
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
this one is 500 yeah
 

311
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,110
this one is 500 yeah
yeah all right log 500 this is log 100

312
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
yeah all right log 500 this is log 100
 

313
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,950
yeah all right log 500 this is log 100
this is called the maternal

314
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
this is called the maternal
 

315
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,390
this is called the maternal
increasing yeah is x

316
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
increasing yeah is x
 

317
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,830
increasing yeah is x
square maternal increasing y equals x

318
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
square maternal increasing y equals x
 

319
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,469
square maternal increasing y equals x
squared

320
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479

 

321
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,550

x to the power 2

322
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560

 

323
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,029

no because its function is like that

324
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
no because its function is like that
 

325
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,870
no because its function is like that
look when x is 0

326
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
look when x is 0
 

327
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,870
look when x is 0
0 when x is 1 is 2 is 4 but when x

328
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
0 when x is 1 is 2 is 4 but when x
 

329
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,070
0 when x is 1 is 2 is 4 but when x
is minus 2 is also 4 okay

330
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
is minus 2 is also 4 okay
 

331
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,189
is minus 2 is also 4 okay
minus two square equals

332
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
minus two square equals
 

333
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,230
minus two square equals
what minus one square times

334
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
what minus one square times
 

335
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,510
what minus one square times
two squared okay minus one square is one

336
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
two squared okay minus one square is one
 

337
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,469
two squared okay minus one square is one
connect because negative double negative

338
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:56,479
connect because negative double negative
 

339
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,790
connect because negative double negative
makes positive okay so this is

340
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
makes positive okay so this is
 

341
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,150
makes positive okay so this is
non-molecular

342
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
non-molecular
 

343
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,430
non-molecular
molecules increasing look because look

344
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
molecules increasing look because look
 

345
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,070
molecules increasing look because look
this is monitor decreasing here but this

346
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
this is monitor decreasing here but this
 

347
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,909
this is monitor decreasing here but this
is monitor increasing yeah it's mirror

348
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
is monitor increasing yeah it's mirror
 

349
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:08,629
is monitor increasing yeah it's mirror
yeah

350
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
yeah
 

351
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,830
yeah
okay so if it's monitor increasing

352
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
okay so if it's monitor increasing
 

353
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,710
okay so if it's monitor increasing
then we can use the binary search don't

354
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
then we can use the binary search don't
 

355
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,550
then we can use the binary search don't
touch it

356
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
touch it
 

357
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,830
touch it
to solve this problem okay okay

358
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
to solve this problem okay okay
 

359
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,189
to solve this problem okay okay
so

360
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199

 

361
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,990

so we don't know the value but we guess

362
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
so we don't know the value but we guess
 

363
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,550
so we don't know the value but we guess
right

364
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
right
 

365
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,670
right
remember we get this value yeah

366
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
remember we get this value yeah
 

367
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,949
remember we get this value yeah
we let's get given this uh uh

368
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
we let's get given this uh uh
 

369
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,589
we let's get given this uh uh
y equals log to x

370
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
y equals log to x
 

371
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,149
y equals log to x
we we want we are given this x but we

372
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
we we want we are given this x but we
 

373
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,190
we we want we are given this x but we
don't know the y

374
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
don't know the y
 

375
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,949
don't know the y
right so we can guess that we uh

376
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
right so we can guess that we uh
 

377
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,670
right so we can guess that we uh
guess let's check this this part first

378
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
guess let's check this this part first
 

379
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,470
guess let's check this this part first
if x is bigger than one okay

380
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
if x is bigger than one okay
 

381
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,990
if x is bigger than one okay
yeah this part so

382
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
yeah this part so
 

383
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,110
yeah this part so
what's the left about left bound is the

384
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
what's the left about left bound is the
 

385
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,150
what's the left about left bound is the
lowest power which is

386
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
lowest power which is
 

387
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,590
lowest power which is
y equals zero right yeah yeah yes

388
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
y equals zero right yeah yeah yes
 

389
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,550
y equals zero right yeah yeah yes
yes yeah one other bar what's the upper

390
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
yes yeah one other bar what's the upper
 

391
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,110
yes yeah one other bar what's the upper
bar

392
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
bar
 

393
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,430
bar
what's the upper bound upper bound you

394
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
what's the upper bound upper bound you
 

395
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,630
what's the upper bound upper bound you
can pick a very large

396
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
can pick a very large
 

397
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,990
can pick a very large
value or you pick up x why why we can

398
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
value or you pick up x why why we can
 

399
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,310
value or you pick up x why why we can
pick

400
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
pick
 

401
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,389
pick
x because when x is y y bigger than one

402
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
x because when x is y y bigger than one
 

403
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,070
x because when x is y y bigger than one
two x to the power of x is always bigger

404
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
two x to the power of x is always bigger
 

405
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,550
two x to the power of x is always bigger
than

406
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
than
 

407
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,990
than
x y 2 to the power 3

408
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
x y 2 to the power 3
 

409
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,190
x y 2 to the power 3
equals 8 which is bigger than 3 right

410
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
equals 8 which is bigger than 3 right
 

411
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,509
equals 8 which is bigger than 3 right
yes all right so you can pick a value

412
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
yes all right so you can pick a value
 

413
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,030
yes all right so you can pick a value
of the

414
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
of the
 

415
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,470
of the
so you can pick a value of x right okay

416
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
so you can pick a value of x right okay
 

417
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,310
so you can pick a value of x right okay
yes so look we can pick a value and then

418
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
yes so look we can pick a value and then
 

419
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,350
yes so look we can pick a value and then
we every time we

420
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
we every time we
 

421
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,509
we every time we
find the numerator and then we compare

422
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
find the numerator and then we compare
 

423
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,829
find the numerator and then we compare
the compel of a

424
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
the compel of a
 

425
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,310
the compel of a
compeller compare if it's actually power

426
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
compeller compare if it's actually power
 

427
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,630
compeller compare if it's actually power
if

428
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
if
 

429
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,710
if
it's actually 2 to the power of this

430
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
it's actually 2 to the power of this
 

431
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,550
it's actually 2 to the power of this
middle value

432
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
middle value
 

433
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,230
middle value
if it's actually if it's bigger than

434
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
if it's actually if it's bigger than
 

435
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,269
if it's actually if it's bigger than
if it's bigger 2 to the power of meat if

436
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
if it's bigger 2 to the power of meat if
 

437
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:03,590
if it's bigger 2 to the power of meat if
it

438
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
it
 

439
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,630
it
is bigger than the y uh no

440
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
is bigger than the y uh no
 

441
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,990
is bigger than the y uh no
if it's it bigger than x x is the given

442
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
if it's it bigger than x x is the given
 

443
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,030
if it's it bigger than x x is the given
input it means it means

444
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
input it means it means
 

445
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,069
input it means it means
that it's in the lower half right

446
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
that it's in the lower half right
 

447
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,190
that it's in the lower half right
otherwise it's in

448
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
otherwise it's in
 

449
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,230
otherwise it's in
it's in the bigger half correct

450
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
it's in the bigger half correct
 

451
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,350
it's in the bigger half correct
okay so let's do this coding okay maybe

452
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
okay so let's do this coding okay maybe
 

453
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,910
okay so let's do this coding okay maybe
coding

454
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
coding
 

455
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,350
coding
will make it more clear

456
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360

 

457
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,110

turn on that thingy no no no define

458
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
turn on that thingy no no no define
 

459
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,710
turn on that thingy no no no define
log 2 x

460
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
log 2 x
 

461
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,750
log 2 x
okay log2x column

462
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
okay log2x column
 

463
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,110
okay log2x column
if let's first check if x is smaller

464
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
if let's first check if x is smaller
 

465
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,590
if let's first check if x is smaller
than

466
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
than
 

467
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,150
than
or equal 0 there is no such thing right

468
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
or equal 0 there is no such thing right
 

469
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,430
or equal 0 there is no such thing right
what should we return will be 10 no

470
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
what should we return will be 10 no
 

471
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,269
what should we return will be 10 no
we're done depending now we can't find

472
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
we're done depending now we can't find
 

473
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,350
we're done depending now we can't find
this this value okay

474
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
this this value okay
 

475
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,269
this this value okay
okay another thing i forgot is there's a

476
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
okay another thing i forgot is there's a
 

477
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,949
okay another thing i forgot is there's a
formula look remember

478
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
formula look remember
 

479
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,949
formula look remember
we talked about this we talked about

480
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:58,959
we talked about this we talked about
 

481
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,630
we talked about this we talked about
this one yeah

482
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
this one yeah
 

483
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,389
this one yeah
when it's here you you can't find the

484
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
when it's here you you can't find the
 

485
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,710
when it's here you you can't find the
lower bound because it's negative

486
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
lower bound because it's negative
 

487
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,710
lower bound because it's negative
infinity so we can turn it into the

488
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
infinity so we can turn it into the
 

489
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,750
infinity so we can turn it into the
positive

490
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
positive
 

491
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,030
positive
so so so there's a formula

492
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
so so so there's a formula
 

493
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,150
so so so there's a formula
it's log a

494
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
it's log a
 

495
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,350
it's log a
b uh

496
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
b uh
 

497
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,870
b uh
wait log

498
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880

 

499
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,230

2 sorry so a

500
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
2 sorry so a
 

501
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,750
2 sorry so a
divided by b equals log 2

502
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
divided by b equals log 2
 

503
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,550
divided by b equals log 2
a minus log 2 b okay there's a formula

504
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
a minus log 2 b okay there's a formula
 

505
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,190
a minus log 2 b okay there's a formula
of least

506
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
of least
 

507
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,870
of least
and then log 2 a times b

508
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
and then log 2 a times b
 

509
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,069
and then log 2 a times b
equals log 2 a plus

510
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
equals log 2 a plus
 

511
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,350
equals log 2 a plus
log 2 p okay okay this is the formula

512
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
log 2 p okay okay this is the formula
 

513
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,470
log 2 p okay okay this is the formula
yeah and now

514
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
yeah and now
 

515
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,430
yeah and now
if we it's x is smaller than minus one

516
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
if we it's x is smaller than minus one
 

517
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,389
if we it's x is smaller than minus one
so we can

518
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
so we can
 

519
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,509
so we can
do it this way log a look to

520
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
do it this way log a look to
 

521
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,230
do it this way log a look to
x yeah not to x equals log two

522
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
x yeah not to x equals log two
 

523
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,310
x yeah not to x equals log two
and let uh also there's a formula

524
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
and let uh also there's a formula
 

525
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,829
and let uh also there's a formula
log 2 a to the power of b

526
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
log 2 a to the power of b
 

527
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,110
log 2 a to the power of b
equals b times log to a okay we're going

528
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
equals b times log to a okay we're going
 

529
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,389
equals b times log to a okay we're going
to use this one

530
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
to use this one
 

531
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,870
to use this one
log 2 a to the power of b equals and we

532
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
log 2 a to the power of b equals and we
 

533
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,990
log 2 a to the power of b equals and we
can move this b

534
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
can move this b
 

535
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,110
can move this b
to the front okay so now you you don't

536
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
to the front okay so now you you don't
 

537
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,150
to the front okay so now you you don't
need to

538
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
need to
 

539
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,470
need to
remember you just need to know we can

540
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
remember you just need to know we can
 

541
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,590
remember you just need to know we can
ten

542
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
ten
 

543
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,870
ten
we can turn when we continue when x is

544
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
we can turn when we continue when x is
 

545
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,829
we can turn when we continue when x is
smaller than one

546
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
smaller than one
 

547
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,150
smaller than one
we can turn this case into the positive

548
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
we can turn this case into the positive
 

549
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,430
we can turn this case into the positive
case so look

550
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
case so look
 

551
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,870
case so look
this is equals to 1

552
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
this is equals to 1
 

553
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,470
this is equals to 1
divided by 1 divided by x right

554
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
divided by 1 divided by x right
 

555
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,110
divided by 1 divided by x right
yeah x x equals 1 divided by 1 divided

556
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
yeah x x equals 1 divided by 1 divided
 

557
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,230
yeah x x equals 1 divided by 1 divided
by x all right

558
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,240
by x all right
 

559
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,310
by x all right
divided by 1 yeah so this thing

560
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
divided by 1 yeah so this thing
 

561
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,750
divided by 1 yeah so this thing
is x divided by x 1 divided by x

562
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
is x divided by x 1 divided by x
 

563
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,710
is x divided by x 1 divided by x
minus 1. look 2 to the power of -1

564
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
minus 1. look 2 to the power of -1
 

565
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,069
minus 1. look 2 to the power of -1
what does it mean it equals 2 to the

566
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
what does it mean it equals 2 to the
 

567
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,350
what does it mean it equals 2 to the
power of 1 divide

568
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
power of 1 divide
 

569
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,389
power of 1 divide
1 over 2 to the power 1 right

570
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
1 over 2 to the power 1 right
 

571
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,230
1 over 2 to the power 1 right
okay let me let me tell you 2 to the

572
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
okay let me let me tell you 2 to the
 

573
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,590
okay let me let me tell you 2 to the
power of 2 what's what's this value

574
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
power of 2 what's what's this value
 

575
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,110
power of 2 what's what's this value
power minus two yeah minus two

576
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
power minus two yeah minus two
 

577
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,269
power minus two yeah minus two
uh

578
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279

 

579
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,870

equals two to the power of two yeah

580
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:14,880
equals two to the power of two yeah
 

581
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,750
equals two to the power of two yeah
you got it yeah yeah so it's a quarter

582
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
you got it yeah yeah so it's a quarter
 

583
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,310
you got it yeah yeah so it's a quarter
yeah

584
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
yeah
 

585
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,470
yeah
another one two to the power three minus

586
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
another one two to the power three minus
 

587
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,509
another one two to the power three minus
three

588
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
three
 

589
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,550
three
t to the power three what

590
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
t to the power three what
 

591
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,990
t to the power three what
minus three equals one two to the power

592
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000
minus three equals one two to the power
 

593
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,990
minus three equals one two to the power
three

594
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
three
 

595
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,550
three
one over because it's minus you need to

596
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
one over because it's minus you need to
 

597
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,230
one over because it's minus you need to
make it one over right

598
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
make it one over right
 

599
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,150
make it one over right
yeah so this this one one over this is

600
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
yeah so this this one one over this is
 

601
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,910
yeah so this this one one over this is
this minus one yeah

602
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
this minus one yeah
 

603
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,750
this minus one yeah
i minus one look right and this thing

604
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
i minus one look right and this thing
 

605
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,069
i minus one look right and this thing
you can move it to the before so it

606
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
you can move it to the before so it
 

607
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,430
you can move it to the before so it
equals

608
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
equals
 

609
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,150
equals
minus log 2 1 divided by x

610
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
minus log 2 1 divided by x
 

611
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,269
minus log 2 1 divided by x
you see when x is negative

612
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
you see when x is negative
 

613
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,790
you see when x is negative
when x is smaller than 1

614
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
when x is smaller than 1
 

615
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,949
when x is smaller than 1
when x is smaller one bigger than zero

616
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
when x is smaller one bigger than zero
 

617
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,670
when x is smaller one bigger than zero
we can turn it into

618
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
we can turn it into
 

619
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,030
we can turn it into
one minus log of and one divided by x so

620
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
one minus log of and one divided by x so
 

621
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,710
one minus log of and one divided by x so
when x is smaller than one

622
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
when x is smaller than one
 

623
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,069
when x is smaller than one
one divided over by x this value is what

624
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
one divided over by x this value is what
 

625
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,670
one divided over by x this value is what
is larger than one right if x is smaller

626
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
is larger than one right if x is smaller
 

627
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:15,990
is larger than one right if x is smaller
than one

628
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
than one
 

629
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,670
than one
like 0.5 one divided by 0.5 equals what

630
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
like 0.5 one divided by 0.5 equals what
 

631
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,790
like 0.5 one divided by 0.5 equals what
two right okay yeah

632
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
two right okay yeah
 

633
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,990
two right okay yeah
yeah okay so now okay

634
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
yeah okay so now okay
 

635
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,829
yeah okay so now okay
i i just write too much thing here but

636
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839
i i just write too much thing here but
 

637
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,509
i i just write too much thing here but
here

638
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
here
 

639
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,910
here
so if x is smaller than one

640
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
so if x is smaller than one
 

641
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,150
so if x is smaller than one
yeah yeah yeah return

642
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
yeah yeah yeah return
 

643
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,990
yeah yeah yeah return
the formula we just said minus log2

644
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
the formula we just said minus log2
 

645
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,509
the formula we just said minus log2
1 divided by x right

646
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
1 divided by x right
 

647
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,790
1 divided by x right
yeah now we just need to focus the case

648
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
yeah now we just need to focus the case
 

649
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,990
yeah now we just need to focus the case
when x is bigger than one right so let's

650
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
when x is bigger than one right so let's
 

651
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,230
when x is bigger than one right so let's
say lower bound

652
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
say lower bound
 

653
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,110
say lower bound
upper bound lower high equals lower

654
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
upper bound lower high equals lower
 

655
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,069
upper bound lower high equals lower
bound is what

656
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
bound is what
 

657
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,310
bound is what
lower bar is zero right because what

658
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
lower bar is zero right because what
 

659
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,949
lower bar is zero right because what
look look at this

660
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
look look at this
 

661
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,310
look look at this
when x one x is here y is

662
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
when x one x is here y is
 

663
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,949
when x one x is here y is
bigger than zero right yeah when x is in

664
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:10,959
bigger than zero right yeah when x is in
 

665
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,069
bigger than zero right yeah when x is in
this range the y

666
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
this range the y
 

667
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,910
this range the y
is b bigger than zero the lower bound is

668
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
is b bigger than zero the lower bound is
 

669
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,230
is b bigger than zero the lower bound is
zero higher bound is what

670
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
zero higher bound is what
 

671
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,069
zero higher bound is what
we can give a very big number or we can

672
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
we can give a very big number or we can
 

673
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,310
we can give a very big number or we can
just put the x right

674
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
just put the x right
 

675
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,430
just put the x right
uh yes because 2 to the power x 2 to the

676
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
uh yes because 2 to the power x 2 to the
 

677
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,829
uh yes because 2 to the power x 2 to the
power x is

678
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839
power x is
 

679
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,990
power x is
always is bigger than x right

680
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
always is bigger than x right
 

681
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,189
always is bigger than x right
yeah so so we can use this now look

682
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
yeah so so we can use this now look
 

683
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,710
yeah so so we can use this now look
why and we can get some initial value

684
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
why and we can get some initial value
 

685
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,790
why and we can get some initial value
current value is zero okay let's just

686
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
current value is zero okay let's just
 

687
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,030
current value is zero okay let's just
guess the value we don't know yet yeah

688
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
guess the value we don't know yet yeah
 

689
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,310
guess the value we don't know yet yeah
but we need to say why the

690
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
but we need to say why the
 

691
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,829
but we need to say why the
abs do we still remember abs yeah

692
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:45,839
abs do we still remember abs yeah
 

693
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,710
abs do we still remember abs yeah
abs absolute value yeah yeah when the

694
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
abs absolute value yeah yeah when the
 

695
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,670
abs absolute value yeah yeah when the
absolute value

696
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680

this is the current value we are uh

704
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
this is the current value we are uh
 

705
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,509
this is the current value we are uh
uh the answer we are looking for

706
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
uh the answer we are looking for
 

707
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,189

okay
 

729
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,110
okay
this error we can define it as

730
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,120

 

731
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,550

0.0001 or we can do this
 

733
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,910

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,350
one two three four five one e minus five
okay

738
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
okay
 

739
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,550
okay
one e column yeah e

740
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,560
one e column yeah e
 

741
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,670
one e column yeah e
what what's e

742
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680

 

743
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,350

e is this it's a good question it's a

744
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
e is this it's a good question it's a
 

745
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,909
e is this it's a good question it's a
scientific notification yeah

746
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
scientific notification yeah
 

747
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,549
scientific notification yeah
just remember we can one e minus five

748
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
just remember we can one e minus five
 

749
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,110
just remember we can one e minus five
equals

750
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
equals
 

751
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,870
equals
zero one e minus one zero point one

752
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
zero one e minus one zero point one
 

753
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,599
zero one e minus one zero point one
y minus two is zero point zero one okay

754
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:17,609
y minus two is zero point zero one okay
 

755
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:21,590
y minus two is zero point zero one okay
[Music]

756
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
[Music]
 

757
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,470
[Music]
okay so it's basically means that uh

758
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
okay so it's basically means that uh
 

759
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,309
okay so it's basically means that uh
where is the thought

760
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
where is the thought
 

761
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,350
where is the thought
so we finished no you know you're quite

762
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
so we finished no you know you're quite
 

763
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,070
so we finished no you know you're quite
quite close

764
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
quite close
 

765
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,350
quite close
quite close okay so this is yours

766
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
quite close okay so this is yours
 

767
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,789
quite close okay so this is yours
yeah so wherever we uh so the value is

768
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
yeah so wherever we uh so the value is
 

769
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,230
yeah so wherever we uh so the value is
that then we need to turn

770
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
that then we need to turn
 

771
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,470
that then we need to turn
uh

772
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480

 

773
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,230

oh actually actually no if current

774
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
oh actually actually no if current
 

775
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,750
oh actually actually no if current
we we if current minus

776
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
we we if current minus
 

777
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,230
we we if current minus
x is bigger than one then we we need to

778
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
x is bigger than one then we we need to
 

779
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,990
x is bigger than one then we we need to
calculate meter meter equals

780
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
calculate meter meter equals
 

781
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,270
calculate meter meter equals
low plus high divided by two

782
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280
low plus high divided by two
 

783
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,150
low plus high divided by two
okay and then current equals power

784
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
okay and then current equals power
 

785
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,230
okay and then current equals power
2 to the power of k meat

786
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
2 to the power of k meat
 

787
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,430
2 to the power of k meat
okay then if current

788
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
okay then if current
 

789
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,390
okay then if current
if current is bigger than x

790
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
if current is bigger than x
 

791
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,070
if current is bigger than x
if carbon is bigger than x we mean

792
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
if carbon is bigger than x we mean
 

793
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,390
if carbon is bigger than x we mean
it means that it's in the lower lower

794
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
it means that it's in the lower lower
 

795
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,390
it means that it's in the lower lower
half right it's in the lower half lower

796
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
half right it's in the lower half lower
 

797
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,430
half right it's in the lower half lower
half so

798
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
half so
 

799
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,029
half so
high equals mid as

800
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,039
high equals mid as
 

801
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,789
high equals mid as
low low equals meat

802
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799
low low equals meat
 

803
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,510
low low equals meat
right and then i only this finish will

804
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
right and then i only this finish will
 

805
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:33,990
right and then i only this finish will
be 10

806
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
be 10
 

807
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,029
be 10
meter yeah we return the meat

808
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:39,039

 

809
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,150

done i think so

810
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
done i think so
 

811
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,110
done i think so
but here we need because we return the

812
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
but here we need because we return the
 

813
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,470
but here we need because we return the
mid we need to put it

814
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
mid we need to put it
 

815
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,590
mid we need to put it
low plus high divided by two

816
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
low plus high divided by two
 

817
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,950
low plus high divided by two
in case okay

818
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
in case okay
 

819
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,270
in case okay
so let's do the coding let's go ahead to

820
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
so let's do the coding let's go ahead to
 

821
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,750
so let's do the coding let's go ahead to
see maybe coding is more clear this this

822
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
see maybe coding is more clear this this
 

823
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,750
see maybe coding is more clear this this
this lesson is a bit difficult okay but

824
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
this lesson is a bit difficult okay but
 

825
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,350
this lesson is a bit difficult okay but
don't worry let's do it

826
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
don't worry let's do it
 

827
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,870
don't worry let's do it
together thank you

828
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:04,880
together thank you
 

829
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,950
together thank you
thank you yes

830
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
thank you yes
 

831
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,110
thank you yes
wait is it what please

832
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,120

 

833
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,190

so let's let's do uh it's clear yeah

834
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,200
so let's let's do uh it's clear yeah
 

835
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,950
so let's let's do uh it's clear yeah
it's very clear okay don't shake okay

836
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
it's very clear okay don't shake okay
 

837
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,150
it's very clear okay don't shake okay
it's very clear

838
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
it's very clear
 

839
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,990
it's very clear
look at that screen look and swing hey

840
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
look at that screen look and swing hey
 

841
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,549
look at that screen look and swing hey
can you see it clear okay yeah yeah

842
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
can you see it clear okay yeah yeah
 

843
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,230
can you see it clear okay yeah yeah
why okay let's do this

844
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
why okay let's do this
 

845
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,350
why okay let's do this
define log2 x

846
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
define log2 x
 

847
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,470
define log2 x
so look if x is smaller than zero

848
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,480
so look if x is smaller than zero
 

849
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,669
so look if x is smaller than zero
or equal to zero we know now we know

850
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
or equal to zero we know now we know
 

851
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,350
or equal to zero we know now we know
there's no such thing

852
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
there's no such thing
 

853
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,029
there's no such thing
if x then is equal smaller than one

854
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
if x then is equal smaller than one
 

855
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,070
if x then is equal smaller than one
we return uh minus

856
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,080
we return uh minus
 

857
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,470
we return uh minus
log2 look this is recursively calling

858
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
log2 look this is recursively calling
 

859
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,230
log2 look this is recursively calling
yeah when it's

860
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:50,240
yeah when it's
 

861
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,630
yeah when it's
smaller than that we recursively calling

862
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
smaller than that we recursively calling
 

863
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,430
smaller than that we recursively calling
uh

864
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:53,440
uh
 

865
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,310
uh
oh wait wait wait wait

866
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320

 

867
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,070

is it clear is it clear can you see it

868
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
is it clear is it clear can you see it
 

869
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,430
is it clear is it clear can you see it
here yeah yeah

870
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440
here yeah yeah
 

871
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,149
here yeah yeah
yeah i'll be cute

872
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159

 

873
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,310

yeah yeah yeah i think this is fine okay

874
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
yeah yeah yeah i think this is fine okay
 

875
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,430
yeah yeah yeah i think this is fine okay
so look look two one one point zero

876
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
so look look two one one point zero
 

877
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,310
so look look two one one point zero
divided by x

878
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
divided by x
 

879
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,549
divided by x
right okay so now low

880
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
right okay so now low
 

881
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,310
right okay so now low
high equals zero

882
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,320
high equals zero
 

883
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,390
high equals zero
and x current equals low

884
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
and x current equals low
 

885
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,830
and x current equals low
low plus height divided by two

886
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:32,840
low plus height divided by two
 

887
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,230
low plus height divided by two
y why the

888
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
y why the
 

889
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,430
y why the
um

890
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440

 

891
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,870

because the current value is the

892
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880

 

893
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,190

wait power 2 to the power of this

894
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
wait power 2 to the power of this
 

895
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,350
wait power 2 to the power of this
we're guessing we're guessing this this

896
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
we're guessing we're guessing this this
 

897
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,029
we're guessing we're guessing this this
value

898
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
value
 

899
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,390
value
y current abs current minus

900
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
y current abs current minus
 

901
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,070
y current abs current minus
x is big still bigger than 1 e

902
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,080
x is big still bigger than 1 e
 

903
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,390
x is big still bigger than 1 e
minus 5 okay this is what i mean look

904
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
minus 5 okay this is what i mean look
 

905
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,549
minus 5 okay this is what i mean look
all right one e minus five is zero point

906
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
all right one e minus five is zero point
 

907
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,430
all right one e minus five is zero point
zero zero zero zero one okay

908
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
zero zero zero zero one okay
 

909
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,789
zero zero zero zero one okay
and then we need the meter equals low

910
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
and then we need the meter equals low
 

911
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,909
and then we need the meter equals low
plus high divided by two high

912
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
plus high divided by two high
 

913
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,510
plus high divided by two high
carbon we update the current two plus i

914
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
carbon we update the current two plus i
 

915
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,669
carbon we update the current two plus i
mean high if

916
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
mean high if
 

917
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,190
mean high if
the high high

918
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200

 

919
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,510

if if now we need to check if this

920
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
if if now we need to check if this
 

921
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,710
if if now we need to check if this
current value

922
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720
current value
 

923
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,909
current value
is bigger than x

924
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:31,919
is bigger than x
 

925
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,710
is bigger than x
right it's bigger than x it means that

926
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
right it's bigger than x it means that
 

927
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,669
right it's bigger than x it means that
the

928
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
the
 

929
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,029
the
uh the the value is in the lower half

930
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
uh the the value is in the lower half
 

931
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,149
uh the the value is in the lower half
so the lower uh the lower power so we

932
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
so the lower uh the lower power so we
 

933
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,110
so the lower uh the lower power so we
change this to the middle as we change

934
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
change this to the middle as we change
 

935
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,710
change this to the middle as we change
this to the

936
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
this to the
 

937
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,350
this to the
middle to the lower bar we can please

938
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
middle to the lower bar we can please
 

939
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,830
middle to the lower bar we can please
equal

940
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:49,840
equal
 

941
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,149
equal
and then return

942
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:54,159

 

943
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,590

yeah let's return 10 right and then 32
 

961
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,150
yeah let's return 10 right and then 32
let's try if it works okay i'm not sure

962
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,160
let's try if it works okay i'm not sure

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
because if you're not declaring the
 

989
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,789
because if you're not declaring the
computer don't know okay

990
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799

 

991
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,549

for example you want to use the arabic

992
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559
for example you want to use the arabic
 

993
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,909
for example you want to use the arabic
value and then

994
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919
value and then
 

995
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,470
value and then
the computer don't know what's the area

996
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
the computer don't know what's the area
 

997
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,350
the computer don't know what's the area
why

998
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
why
 

999
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,270
why
so you need to define it define it

1000
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
so you need to define it define it
 

1001
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,870
so you need to define it define it
before you use it good job

1002
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
before you use it good job
 

1003
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,870
before you use it good job
why

1004
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880

 

1005
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,510

the first value is very small so you can

1006
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
the first value is very small so you can
 

1007
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,549
the first value is very small so you can
pretend

1008
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
pretend
 

1009
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,549
pretend
because it's close to zero so the

1010
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559
because it's close to zero so the
 

1011
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,750
because it's close to zero so the
computer the floating

1012
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760

 

1013
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,470

numbers can be displayed something very

1014
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480
numbers can be displayed something very
 

1015
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,470
numbers can be displayed something very
strange but it's very close to zero

1016
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
strange but it's very close to zero
 

1017
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,230
strange but it's very close to zero
so the second value one point zero ten

1018
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,240
so the second value one point zero ten
 

1019
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,070
so the second value one point zero ten
point zero five point zero okay let's

1020
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
point zero five point zero okay let's
 

1021
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,789
point zero five point zero okay let's
see

1022
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
see
 

1023
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,149
see
if it's yeah two to the power log two

1024
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:48,159
if it's yeah two to the power log two
 

1025
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,990
if it's yeah two to the power log two
two is one point zero log two

1026
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
two is one point zero log two
 

1027
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,430
two is one point zero log two
uh so log two this is this if you

1028
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
uh so log two this is this if you
 

1029
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,750
uh so log two this is this if you
put the uh let's you put in one yeah

1030
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
put the uh let's you put in one yeah
 

1031
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,630
put the uh let's you put in one yeah
this should bring this you put in the

1032
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
this should bring this you put in the
 

1033
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,110
this should bring this you put in the
ten

1034
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,120
ten
 

1035
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:11,880
ten
unless you bring five right

1036
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:11,890

 

1037

1039
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,430

okay so uh let's try some numbers

1040
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,440
okay so uh let's try some numbers
 

1041
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,350
okay so uh let's try some numbers
try the neg the number between

1042
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360
try the neg the number between
 

1043
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,230
try the neg the number between
between zero and one so what is log two

1044
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,240
between zero and one so what is log two
 

1045
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,510
between zero and one so what is log two
zero point one

1046
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,520
zero point one
 

1047
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,149
zero point one
return you should return something

1048
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
return you should return something
 

1049
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,029
return you should return something
negative right yeah

1050
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
negative right yeah
 

1051
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,190
negative right yeah
yes exactly it returns something

1052
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
yes exactly it returns something
 

1053
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,310
yes exactly it returns something
negative you see

1054
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
negative you see
 

1055
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,950
negative you see
so we use the binary search and let's

1056
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
so we use the binary search and let's
 

1057
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,669
so we use the binary search and let's
just do it

1058
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
just do it
 

1059
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,470
just do it
what about zero 0.2

1060
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,480
what about zero 0.2
 

1061
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,669
what about zero 0.2
what would that do so it should be okay

1062
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:49,679
what would that do so it should be okay
 

1063
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,390
what would that do so it should be okay
good question

1064
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
good question
 

1065
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,029
good question
so what's the number is it it should be

1066
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
so what's the number is it it should be
 

1067
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,149
so what's the number is it it should be
bigger than

1068
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,159
bigger than
 

1069
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,909
bigger than
and blocked to 0.1 or no

1070
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
and blocked to 0.1 or no
 

1071
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,230
and blocked to 0.1 or no
what's the value is it bigger than look

1072
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,240
what's the value is it bigger than look
 

1073
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,230
what's the value is it bigger than look
look to 0.1 yeah

1074
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
look to 0.1 yeah
 

1075
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,590
look to 0.1 yeah
yeah yeah

1076
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600

 

1077
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,190

yeah minus 2.3 is bigger than minus 3.3

1078
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200
yeah minus 2.3 is bigger than minus 3.3
 

1079
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,470
yeah minus 2.3 is bigger than minus 3.3
i'm alright

1080
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,480
i'm alright
 

1081
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,590
i'm alright
yes yeah

1082
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600

 

1083
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,830

so let's let's let's review this code a

1084
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
so let's let's let's review this code a
 

1085
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,190
so let's let's let's review this code a
little bit more okay

1086
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
little bit more okay
 

1087
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,549
little bit more okay
so if x is smaller than zero uh we can't

1088
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
so if x is smaller than zero uh we can't
 

1089
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,070
so if x is smaller than zero uh we can't
find such value okay

1090
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,080
find such value okay
 

1091
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:30,850
find such value okay
let's let's let's oh i forgot

1092
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:30,860

1099
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,230

no what i want is that i want to put

1100
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,240
no what i want is that i want to put
 

1101
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,710
no what i want is that i want to put
this

1102
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
this
 

1103
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,870
this
uh graph so you can have a look better

1104
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
uh graph so you can have a look better
 

1105
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,149
uh graph so you can have a look better
this is x this is y and then log 2 x is

1106
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:52,159
this is x this is y and then log 2 x is
 

1107
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,430
this is x this is y and then log 2 x is
this yeah

1108
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
this yeah
 

1109
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,029
this yeah
log 2 y equals not to x

1110
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
log 2 y equals not to x
 

1111
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,149
log 2 y equals not to x
this is one this is one and it's

1112
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159
this is one this is one and it's
 

1113
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,269
this is one this is one and it's
from the value of y is from negative to

1114
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
from the value of y is from negative to
 

1115
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,870
from the value of y is from negative to
positive yeah you see

1116
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:06,880
positive yeah you see
 

1117
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,310
positive yeah you see
yeah negative two positive

1118
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
yeah negative two positive
 

1119
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,549
yeah negative two positive
okay so look if x is smaller than zero

1120
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
okay so look if x is smaller than zero
 

1121
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,350
okay so look if x is smaller than zero
you can find such

1122
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:13,360
you can find such
 

1123
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,269
you can find such
value in the graph in the mathematical

1124
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
value in the graph in the mathematical
 

1125
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,990
value in the graph in the mathematical
yeah if x is smaller than one and bigger

1126
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,000
yeah if x is smaller than one and bigger
 

1127
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,990
yeah if x is smaller than one and bigger
than zero we turn it into

1128
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
than zero we turn it into
 

1129
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,470
than zero we turn it into
the bigger case which is bigger than one

1130
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:22,480
the bigger case which is bigger than one
 

1131
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,149
the bigger case which is bigger than one
otherwise we find the meter

1132
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:24,159
otherwise we find the meter
 

1133
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,909
otherwise we find the meter
we define the range upper power and

1134
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
we define the range upper power and
 

1135
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,350
we define the range upper power and
lower bound

1136
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,360
lower bound
 

1137
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,669
lower bound
the upper bound at lower every array

1138
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
the upper bound at lower every array
 

1139
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,710
the upper bound at lower every array
please

1140
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:30,720
please
 

1141
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,870
please
and then we calculate the value two to

1142
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
and then we calculate the value two to
 

1143
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,470
and then we calculate the value two to
the mean power of mean

1144
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:34,480
the mean power of mean
 

1145
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,230
the mean power of mean
yeah when the current e and then x

1146
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,240
yeah when the current e and then x
 

1147
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,190
yeah when the current e and then x
if current is the same as x we we know

1148
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,200
if current is the same as x we we know
 

1149
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,390
if current is the same as x we we know
the value is mid

1150
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,400
the value is mid
 

1151
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,310
the value is mid
right yes yes meter and then

1152
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320
right yes yes meter and then
 

1153
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,470
right yes yes meter and then
current and if it's bigger than x we

1154
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
current and if it's bigger than x we
 

1155
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,430
current and if it's bigger than x we
find it

1156
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:49,440
find it
 

1157
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,630
find it
because when x look

1158
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:52,640
because when x look
 

1159
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,190
because when x look
if this is the final result if we find

1160
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,200
if this is the final result if we find
 

1161
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,630
if this is the final result if we find
this value

1162
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
this value
 

1163
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,190
this value
if if we find this value is bigger we

1164
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
if if we find this value is bigger we
 

1165
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,710
if if we find this value is bigger we
have a lower bound

1166
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,720
have a lower bound
 

1167
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,310
have a lower bound
we have a lower bound here for example

1168
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,320
we have a lower bound here for example
 

1169
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,310
we have a lower bound here for example
and upper bound here and we find this

1170
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
and upper bound here and we find this
 

1171
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,710
and upper bound here and we find this
value

1172
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
value
 

1173
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,310
value
down yeah if this value x if we're given

1174
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,320
down yeah if this value x if we're given
 

1175
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,750
down yeah if this value x if we're given
this value x here

1176
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:09,760
this value x here
 

1177
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,029
this value x here
is here it will give you x here but this

1178
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
is here it will give you x here but this
 

1179
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,510
is here it will give you x here but this
value is bigger than this value so we

1180
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,520
value is bigger than this value so we
 

1181
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,870
value is bigger than this value so we
know

1182
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:16,880
know
 

1183
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,190
know
it's in the lower half right so we

1184
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
it's in the lower half right so we
 

1185
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,149
it's in the lower half right so we
continue

1186
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
continue
 

1187
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,070
continue
search in this half otherwise we search

1188
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,080
search in this half otherwise we search
 

1189
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,269
search in this half otherwise we search
in this half

1190
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:23,279
in this half
 

1191
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,510
in this half
okay so this is what i mean even bigger

1192
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:25,520
okay so this is what i mean even bigger
 

1193
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,350
okay so this is what i mean even bigger
than the value then we search in the

1194
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,360
than the value then we search in the
 

1195
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,510
than the value then we search in the
lower half otherwise in the middle half

1196
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520
lower half otherwise in the middle half
 

1197
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,830
lower half otherwise in the middle half
when this value when is the difference

1198
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:31,840
when this value when is the difference
 

1199
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,590
when this value when is the difference
is smaller than

1200
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:33,600
is smaller than
 

1201
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,070
is smaller than
smaller than these then we find a value

1202
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,080
smaller than these then we find a value
 

1203
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,669
smaller than these then we find a value
which is very close to the

1204
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:37,679
which is very close to the
 

1205
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,950
which is very close to the
what value we want okay put it yes

1206
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:40,960
what value we want okay put it yes
 

1207
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,350
what value we want okay put it yes
okay okay okay so good job today okay

1208
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
okay okay okay so good job today okay
 

1209
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,430
okay okay okay so good job today okay
this is a bit tricky okay

1210
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,440
this is a bit tricky okay
 

1211
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,960
this is a bit tricky okay
