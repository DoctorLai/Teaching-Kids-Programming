1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,880
one two three zero

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,080
positive integers

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,939
okay so I'm going to write the output

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,619
you tell me what what is that okay two

5
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:28,439
three five five one two three Fields

6
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,260
okay just written all the digits

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,460
separate yeah separate the digit yes

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:38,399
separated okay how to do it

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,420
split how do we split the digit how do

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,780
we get the 35 into 3 and 5.

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,559
how do we split

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,020
yeah with the split word

13
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,260
is for the string so we need to convert

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,260
it is

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,000
yeah that's one way so we can combine

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,440
these into three we will flip we'll slip

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,440
on the banana split okay

18
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,459
[Music]

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,619
Okay so

20
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,259
convert it to string and then split okay

21
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,119
actually cover the string because the

22
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,280
bridge we need at the diminutive okay

23
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,159
but for this one we are not using

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,140
display we're using the list so what's a

25
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,500
spray okay now let's take an example if

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,900
this is one two three if this is a you

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,380
can say a does split

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:50,820
straight and give a delimiter right and

29
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,320
then it will give us a list of one

30
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,780
two

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,259
three right this is what the split is

32
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,799
and the opposite way is

33
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:04,860
join yeah so if we can say this the joy

34
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:08,099
you know turn at least one two

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:11,039
it has to be string right one two three

36
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,180
and then it will give us this thing but

37
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,280
for

38
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,500
this kind of thing one two three how can

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,280
we split into digits we can use this

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,760
this we just use the list we we split

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,760
list

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,440
but there's no space the thing is

43
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,480
there's no space so we use this this is

44
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,520
a special case use a list we turn

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,459
basically we turn a string into a list

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,520
so you give us one two three even simple

47
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,959
okay

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,140
that's one way convert into the string

49
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,140
yeah

50
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,319
which one is it already it's the

51
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,459
original one

52
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,980
divided 123 and zero this is a number

53
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,959
okay

54
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,360
but we want to get this so basically we

55
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,120
want to iterate over the digit each

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,040
digit and we converted a string and then

57
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,140
we turn into a list

58
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,780
and we convert it back to the numbers

59
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,760
and we push it back right okay the other

60
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,700
way how do we get the numbers one two

61
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,980
three four with modulus 10 divided by 10

62
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,040
right but that will give us

63
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,319
four three two one it's in the reverse

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,360
order right it's in reverse order if we

65
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,580
get this uh multiple ten divided by 10

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,620
model 10 right

67
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,480
in Reverse also then we can reverse it

68
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,440
right the first approach by converting

69
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,959
to a string okay Define f uh we're given

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,959
this that is if this is a

71
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,260
all right I learned it means to return a

72
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:45,659
list of integer right this topic array

73
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:47,760
equals empty for I in we go to each

74
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,319
numbers right and then we want to

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,200
convert it to string right

76
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,799
so if this is I right convert it to

77
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,659
string Str I

78
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,180
this is converted to the string and I

79
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:03,299
will use the list

80
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,420
list this turns into a way of strings

81
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:10,519
but we need to turn each one into

82
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,519
integer so we can use this map thing

83
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,819
basically that means that we want to

84
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,100
apply this integer function to every

85
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,440
element in the list okay so then each

86
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,260
one is that and then we need to

87
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,320
then we need to append all the elements

88
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,419
here to the AR right look if this is ARR

89
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,300
is one two three

90
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:33,780
okay and if this is a equals four and

91
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:38,280
five how can we append 4 inside into ARR

92
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:41,820
so we use the function a r r dot extent

93
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,199
okay so that will push four and five

94
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,560
into

95
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,139
the back of the AR okay yeah when it

96
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,600
says extend we can do the other way push

97
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,780
every element in the a to a r so a

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,020
stupid way is for I in a

99
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,180
and then a a pen

100
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,280
a pen all right

101
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,680
this is the same thing as this one okay

102
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,139
these two are the same thing

103
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,320
for you to the first combine into the

104
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:12,540
string we turn it into a list we map it

105
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,639
back to our integer and then we need to

106
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,820
arr.x10

107
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,820
foreign

108
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,139
this is the

109
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,259
Simple Solution Phantom black State we

110
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,780
go through the a if like an element here

111
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,240
and then if each digit on average is

112
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,039
three okay so the time difference is o n

113
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
times t

114
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,060
right because we converted the string

115
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,759
let's face complexity obviously we need

116
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,060
to convert it to a list here if we're

117
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,639
not treating the output array as a space

118
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,520
so we just consider being released list

119
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,220
so let's face complexes I will see we

120
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,460
need additional array to store the

121
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,620
digits let's do another way which is to

122
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,960
convert it to a digit extract that

123
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,780
digits by modulus 10 divide by 10 right

124
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,199
so instead of this I will decorate the

125
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:07,680
space though he said it has to have a

126
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,259
space in color how does it how does it

127
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,940
create space allocating the space yeah

128
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,539
how does it create the space in between

129
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,759
the digit yes oh another space not a

130
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,160
space I mean the space complexity okay

131
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,199
the second approach yeah the second

132
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,500
approach let's do this

133
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,300
for I go through each digit each number

134
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,580
and let's pull this current in the

135
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,419
current right so then we go through this

136
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:36,419
we try to teach y i bigger than zero

137
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:38,940
carbon dot a pen

138
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:41,220
I modulus 10 right this is the least

139
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,440
significant digit but this is on once

140
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,479
and then we need to get rid of it I

141
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,300
divided divided by a ten now this

142
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,520
current is the reverse so one two three

143
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,620
will be three two one right so

144
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,139
how can we

145
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,000
how can we reverse it right how do we

146
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:01,620
reverse this one three two one we want

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,620
to make it reverse to one two three yeah

148
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,960
in price on this is a common B comma C

149
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:16,199
right and you can omit it right if it is

150
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,120
a I mean it it will be by default zero

151
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,340
if B omitted it will be the length of

152
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,259
the array

153
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,220
if C I'll make it there will be one

154
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:28,380
right

155
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,780
so is that from A to B step C so from a

156
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,479
to length step minus one which is the

157
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:37,139
opposite so we want to get it Opposite

158
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:40,800
so a r r dot extend

159
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,240
extend currently normal management

160
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,520
why you mentioned a good point two

161
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,979
points I think so how do we do for that

162
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,919
one two three four

163
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:52,919
two point one and four swap

164
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,919
answer

165
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,740
I model sense I divide the button what

166
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,039
does it mean

167
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,039
if

168
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,800
the number 12.3 one two three we ought

169
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,500
to get the number three

170
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,300
this is modulus 10 right

171
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,800
and then

172
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:28,740
I want to make 123 one two

173
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:32,339
123 divided divided by 10. yeah module

174
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,740
is 10 3 divided by 10.

175
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,659
integer divide get rid of the last

176
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,599
stitches okay and then keep repeating

177
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:42,240
until all the digits have been extracted

178
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,520
okay if we don't reverse it how do we do

179
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,440
it look okay so look this digit we get a

180
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,339
three two this Stitch we get a five

181
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,140
three this Stitch we get a three two one

182
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:53,519
zero so what's the answer here this is

183
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,899
two three

184
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,820
five

185
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,399
one two three

186
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,120
and zero right this is the array we want

187
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:06,540
to get and if we reverse each Bit Zero

188
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,680
three two one

189
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:13,260
five three two three okay so if we go

190
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,480
from the back if we iterate from the

191
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,339
back reverse the first number is zero

192
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,899
zero that's zero this number one two

193
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,519
three right because we reverse it

194
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,920
already yeah we don't need to reverse

195
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,160
here so we do it first it will be three

196
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,019
to one okay and then it's three five

197
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,540
with the reverse it would be five three

198
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,680
and then two three we reverse it will be

199
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,040
three two

200
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,380
what's the the relation between please

201
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,380
two two three five one two three zero

202
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,640
and zero three two one five three three

203
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,160
two

204
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,440
what's the relation between these two

205
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,540
this is reverse right

206
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,380
and then we can just reverse this bit a

207
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,160
little bit so we go song

208
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,440
minus one

209
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,920
I know we don't need to reverse it we

210
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,560
need to reverse it here one one two one

211
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,279
two three okay these three numbers we go

212
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,200
from the last one which is three two one

213
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,740
we're gonna set a camera which is two

214
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,800
what we're gonna first one with this one

215
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,440
three two one two one one okay the

216
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,140
answer is one one two

217
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,180
one two three right it's the reverse

218
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,680
come complexity for these two I think

219
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,899
it's the same right because we go into

220
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,000
each digit for each Stitch we need to

221
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,220
extract the digits of the number and

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,519
let's face complexity we still need to

223
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,620
use the additional array to hold the

224
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,080
digit of a particular number right

225
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,740
before we push it using the extent the

226
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,720
Fourth Way return to single line

227
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:47,519
Integrity for

228
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,019
this is a okay so for number l in a for

229
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,640
t

230
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,660
in

231
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,399
each one s t r n

232
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,880
okay

233
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,579
so we're going through the array this n

234
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,160
is this is the number and then we

235
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:07,380
convert it to string and we iterate over

236
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,019
the digit and this T we need to convert

237
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,300
it back to the integer okay so that's it

238
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,820
actually the solution is this one a

239
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,240
little Integrity because we want to uh

240
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:21,720
integer path and the digit

241
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,940
and then this tea is Str converting to n

242
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,899
to the string N is a number and what's

243
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:32,040
an N is the digit each number in each

244
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:35,279
number 23 35 okay so here and

245
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:39,000
this is n right this is an n

246
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,880
we converted n to Star and we iterate D

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,860
each digit but it's a string type we

248
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,660
need to convert it to integer type so

249
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,959
these are the four methods okay so which

250
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,740
one is the best which one you like

251
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,660
um

252
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:56,880
what have you learned today

253
00:11:51,660 --> 00:12:03,320
um we learned how to split number digits

254
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,320
into regular numbers one digit numbers

255
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,040
okay Eric we're having a

256
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,130
one

257
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,090
um

258
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,090
[Music]

259
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,680
we're trying to split them into one this

260
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,140
year we have numbers and we've splitting

261
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,140
them into one digit number and then we

262
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,500
need to append them to the result right

263
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:33,320
yeah so how can we do it how many ways

264
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,320
yes so reverse yeah

265
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:40,610
oh the first one which is the first one

266
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:44,299
okay three four Solutions

267
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,299
[Music]

268
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:51,600
then we divide 10 we get one digit and

269
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,880
then we keep on repeating until we yeah

270
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,279
but the thing is that this one is the in

271
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,800
the reverse order we need to yeah we

272
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,860
need to reverse it right yes okay that's

273
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,420
it for today bye-bye goodbye bye bye

274
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,139
hello

275
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,139
foreign
