00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,190
oh hey hello miss terry hello mr ryan
how are you today

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:05,200
how are you today
 

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,590
how are you today
good good okay so today we talk about

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
good good okay so today we talk about
 

7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,030
good good okay so today we talk about
something very interesting which is

8
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,040
something very interesting which is
 

9
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,589
something very interesting which is
called

10
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
called
 

11
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,830
called
the arrangement can you guess what these

12
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:11,840
the arrangement can you guess what these
 

13
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,190
the arrangement can you guess what these
mean

14
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
mean
 

15
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:24,390
mean
the rendering

16
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400

 

17
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,670

putting things in order derangement is

18
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,680
putting things in order derangement is
 

19
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,790
putting things in order derangement is
not in order okay so but this is uh

20
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
not in order okay so but this is uh
 

21
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,590
not in order okay so but this is uh
has a special meaning which is group uh

22
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
has a special meaning which is group uh
 

23
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,830
has a special meaning which is group uh
look if there are three numbers yes

24
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840
look if there are three numbers yes
 

25
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,030
look if there are three numbers yes
what arrangement in order you'll be one

26
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
what arrangement in order you'll be one
 

27
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,310
what arrangement in order you'll be one
two three right yes

28
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
two three right yes
 

29
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,670
two three right yes
let's ignore the that's because the

30
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
let's ignore the that's because the
 

31
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,430
let's ignore the that's because the
first number it's

32
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
first number it's
 

33
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,549
first number it's
in the first place the second number

34
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
in the first place the second number
 

35
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,189
in the first place the second number
is in the second place the third number

36
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
is in the second place the third number
 

37
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,029
is in the second place the third number
is in the third place okay

38
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
is in the third place okay
 

39
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,189
is in the third place okay
yes so the arrangement means that

40
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
yes so the arrangement means that
 

41
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,830
yes so the arrangement means that
the one cannot be in its position

42
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
the one cannot be in its position
 

43
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,350
the one cannot be in its position
so it can be here or here two cannot be

44
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
so it can be here or here two cannot be
 

45
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,149
so it can be here or here two cannot be
in

46
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
in
 

47
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,109
in
second place because it's not you know i

48
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
second place because it's not you know i
 

49
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:09,510
second place because it's not you know i
just

50
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
just
 

51
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,469
just
want it to be in other places three one

52
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
want it to be in other places three one
 

53
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,030
want it to be in other places three one
two

54
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
two
 

55
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,350
two
yeah one two okay so let's do right one

56
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
yeah one two okay so let's do right one
 

57
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,469
yeah one two okay so let's do right one
that's the the

58
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
that's the the
 

59
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,510
that's the the
arrangement for example like three one

60
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
arrangement for example like three one
 

61
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,429
arrangement for example like three one
two this is what one of the degreement

62
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
two this is what one of the degreement
 

63
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,350
two this is what one of the degreement
sequence permutation yeah so

64
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
sequence permutation yeah so
 

65
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,870
sequence permutation yeah so
how many look just remind me how many

66
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
how many look just remind me how many
 

67
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,350
how many look just remind me how many
total solutions if there are n numbers

68
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
total solutions if there are n numbers
 

69
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,109
total solutions if there are n numbers
and how many permutations

70
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
and how many permutations
 

71
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,069
and how many permutations
remember we talked about is

72
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:37,079
remember we talked about is
 

73
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,350
remember we talked about is
communication yeah

74
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
communication yeah
 

75
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,389
communication yeah
what's permutation one two three

76
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:42,399
what's permutation one two three
 

77
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,630
what's permutation one two three
is that if you're using three numbers

78
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
is that if you're using three numbers
 

79
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,270
is that if you're using three numbers
how many permutations you can get

80
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280

 

81
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,510

remember how many plays how many

82
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
remember how many plays how many
 

83
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,310
remember how many plays how many
possible

84
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
possible
 

85
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,830
possible
numbers can the first number be

86
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
numbers can the first number be
 

87
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,950
numbers can the first number be
three how many for the second number two

88
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
three how many for the second number two
 

89
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,429
three how many for the second number two
how many for the third number one so

90
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
how many for the third number one so
 

91
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,550
how many for the third number one so
what's the total

92
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
what's the total
 

93
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,709
what's the total
six yeah three times two times one so

94
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
six yeah three times two times one so
 

95
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,830
six yeah three times two times one so
that permutation for n numbers

96
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
that permutation for n numbers
 

97
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,469
that permutation for n numbers
is n factorial am right

98
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
is n factorial am right
 

99
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,309
is n factorial am right
yes okay so now

100
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
yes okay so now
 

101
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,830
yes okay so now
obviously yes obviously

102
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
obviously yes obviously
 

103
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,949
obviously yes obviously
the total number of derangement is less

104
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
the total number of derangement is less
 

105
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,670
the total number of derangement is less
than the

106
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
than the
 

107
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,910
than the
n factorial right because that's the

108
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
n factorial right because that's the
 

109
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,510
n factorial right because that's the
possible total number of possible

110
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
possible total number of possible
 

111
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,790
possible total number of possible
permutation right

112
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
permutation right
 

113
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,710
permutation right
which includes the derangement right yes

114
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
which includes the derangement right yes
 

115
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,910
which includes the derangement right yes
yeah and so

116
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
yeah and so
 

117
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,190
yeah and so
the question is how given the number n

118
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
the question is how given the number n
 

119
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,670
the question is how given the number n
given number and every y we want to find

120
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
given number and every y we want to find
 

121
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,869
given number and every y we want to find
out how many different

122
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
out how many different
 

123
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,150
out how many different
arrangements per mutation it can be

124
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
arrangements per mutation it can be
 

125
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,790
arrangements per mutation it can be
they are okay so for example given

126
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
they are okay so for example given
 

127
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,150
they are okay so for example given
number

128
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
number
 

129
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,589
number
one okay for for example given what

130
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
one okay for for example given what
 

131
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,589
one okay for for example given what
number how many different arrangement

132
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
number how many different arrangement
 

133
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,030
number how many different arrangement
sequence is just one number

134
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
sequence is just one number
 

135
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,630
sequence is just one number
one no zero because look

136
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
one no zero because look
 

137
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,670
one no zero because look
one is in its place so it can't be

138
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
one is in its place so it can't be
 

139
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,949
one is in its place so it can't be
it's not true so it's different

140
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
it's not true so it's different
 

141
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,229
it's not true so it's different
there's none arrangement okay how about

142
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
there's none arrangement okay how about
 

143
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:10,790
there's none arrangement okay how about
two

144
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
two
 

145
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,790
two
two numbers how many one two how many

146
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
two numbers how many one two how many
 

147
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,350
two numbers how many one two how many
one yeah because it can only be two one

148
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
one yeah because it can only be two one
 

149
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,710
one yeah because it can only be two one
right it cannot be

150
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
right it cannot be
 

151
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,630
right it cannot be
one two okay so look so that's easy yeah

152
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
one two okay so look so that's easy yeah
 

153
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,910
one two okay so look so that's easy yeah
you call the concept let's say f is the

154
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
you call the concept let's say f is the
 

155
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,270
you call the concept let's say f is the
function we are going to

156
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
function we are going to
 

157
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,550
function we are going to
look at f zero um obviously there's no

158
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
look at f zero um obviously there's no
 

159
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,550
look at f zero um obviously there's no
zero so let's do f1

160
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
zero so let's do f1
 

161
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,390
zero so let's do f1
equals zero right f2

162
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
equals zero right f2
 

163
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,589
equals zero right f2
equals one right

164
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599

 

165
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,270

equals one yeah because they can only be

166
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
equals one yeah because they can only be
 

167
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,990
equals one yeah because they can only be
two one right

168
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
two one right
 

169
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,190
two one right
two numbers you can only place into one

170
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
two numbers you can only place into one
 

171
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,750
two numbers you can only place into one
that means the requirement which is each

172
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
that means the requirement which is each
 

173
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,990
that means the requirement which is each
number is not in its original

174
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
number is not in its original
 

175
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,030
number is not in its original
position got it

176
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
position got it
 

177
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,789
position got it
okay so now how can we calculate fn

178
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
okay so now how can we calculate fn
 

179
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,869
okay so now how can we calculate fn
the question is how can we calculate fn

180
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
the question is how can we calculate fn
 

181
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,990
the question is how can we calculate fn
okay

182
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
okay
 

183
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,750

are
 

193
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,469
are
n minus n numbers here yeah

194
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
n minus n numbers here yeah
 

195
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,909
n minus n numbers here yeah
yeah and i want to put the n number n

196
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
yeah and i want to put the n number n
 

197
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,430
yeah and i want to put the n number n
here

198
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
here
 

199
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,629
here
these are from number one to n minus one

200
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
these are from number one to n minus one
 

201
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,510
these are from number one to n minus one
right

202
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
right
 

203
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,110
right
and i want to put number n here right

204
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
and i want to put number n here right
 

205
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,230
and i want to put number n here right
so i want to put the number n so how how

206
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
so i want to put the number n so how how
 

207
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,390
so i want to put the number n so how how
i cannot put it here right because this

208
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
i cannot put it here right because this
 

209
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,350
i cannot put it here right because this
is not

210
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
is not
 

211
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,670
is not
n will be original position will be here

212
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
n will be original position will be here
 

213
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,390
n will be original position will be here
right

214
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
right
 

215
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,830
right
yes so how many positions i can put

216
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
yes so how many positions i can put
 

217
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,070
yes so how many positions i can put
in there's no fight i mean how many

218
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
in there's no fight i mean how many
 

219
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,030
in there's no fight i mean how many
positions

220
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
positions
 

221
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,629
positions
six no i'm not talking about the number

222
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
six no i'm not talking about the number
 

223
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,749
six no i'm not talking about the number
i'm talking about this is

224
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
i'm talking about this is
 

225
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,110
i'm talking about this is
n and n minus one yes

226
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
n and n minus one yes
 

227
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,590
n and n minus one yes
so look i put n i can only put in n

228
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
so look i put n i can only put in n
 

229
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,270
so look i put n i can only put in n
minus one position yeah

230
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
minus one position yeah
 

231
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,390
minus one position yeah
yes okay good job

232
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
yes okay good job
 

233
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,150
yes okay good job
okay now if i put it in this number k

234
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
okay now if i put it in this number k
 

235
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,310
okay now if i put it in this number k
for example any number okay yeah

236
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
for example any number okay yeah
 

237
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,150
for example any number okay yeah
yes and the k can be put here right

238
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
yes and the k can be put here right
 

239
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,189
yes and the k can be put here right
let's see four people yeah yeah

240
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
let's see four people yeah yeah
 

241
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,870
let's see four people yeah yeah
all right yeah because because the

242
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
all right yeah because because the
 

243
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,990
all right yeah because because the
the n this position belongs to

244
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
the n this position belongs to
 

245
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,870
the n this position belongs to
n right all right the last partition

246
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
n right all right the last partition
 

247
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,390
n right all right the last partition
belongs to n

248
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
belongs to n
 

249
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,270
belongs to n
if i don't take if n is placed in the

250
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
if i don't take if n is placed in the
 

251
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,830
if i don't take if n is placed in the
first n minus y so any number i swap it

252
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
first n minus y so any number i swap it
 

253
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,670
first n minus y so any number i swap it
can be directly put in the last

254
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
can be directly put in the last
 

255
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,710
can be directly put in the last
number right yes yeah because

256
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
number right yes yeah because
 

257
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,390
number right yes yeah because
because this this ndk can just put it in

258
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
because this this ndk can just put it in
 

259
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,350
because this this ndk can just put it in
a

260
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
a
 

261
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,510
a
in the last position because this this

262
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
in the last position because this this
 

263
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,550
in the last position because this this
[ __ ]

264
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
[ __ ]
 

265
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,749
[ __ ]
is not does not belongs to this n

266
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
is not does not belongs to this n
 

267
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,230
is not does not belongs to this n
minus one any of these n minus one right

268
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
minus one any of these n minus one right
 

269
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,510
minus one any of these n minus one right
yes

270
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
yes
 

271
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,029
yes
so there are if i put it here if i can

272
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
so there are if i put it here if i can
 

273
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:57,990
so there are if i put it here if i can
put it here

274
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
put it here
 

275
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,110
put it here
so how many positions how many numbers

276
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
so how many positions how many numbers
 

277
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,430
so how many positions how many numbers
can

278
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
can
 

279
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,469
can
how many solutions are these kind of

280
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
how many solutions are these kind of
 

281
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,270
how many solutions are these kind of
solutions

282
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
solutions
 

283
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,629
solutions
how many so look if i put an n here and

284
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
how many so look if i put an n here and
 

285
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,029
how many so look if i put an n here and
i

286
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
i
 

287
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,390
i
put a k here so they are m minus two

288
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
put a k here so they are m minus two
 

289
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,430
put a k here so they are m minus two
possibility am right yes

290
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
possibility am right yes
 

291
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,870
possibility am right yes
f n minus two

292
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880

 

293
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,550

right yeah look can you imagine if i put

294
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
right yeah look can you imagine if i put
 

295
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,110
right yeah look can you imagine if i put
the k

296
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
the k
 

297
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,230
the k
at the last yeah and put an n

298
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
at the last yeah and put an n
 

299
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,790
at the last yeah and put an n
so basically i picked one of the n minus

300
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
so basically i picked one of the n minus
 

301
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,749
so basically i picked one of the n minus
one number

302
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
one number
 

303
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,990
one number
yeah the first and then and i swapped it

304
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
yeah the first and then and i swapped it
 

305
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,350
yeah the first and then and i swapped it
with n

306
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
with n
 

307
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,070
with n
yeah i swap it so the rest will be n

308
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
yeah i swap it so the rest will be n
 

309
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,830
yeah i swap it so the rest will be n
minus two right

310
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
minus two right
 

311
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,110
minus two right
yeah so i can just times it a minus two

312
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
yeah so i can just times it a minus two
 

313
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,070
yeah so i can just times it a minus two
yeah times it

314
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
yeah times it
 

315
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,469
yeah times it
yeah this is and how about if i don't

316
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
yeah this is and how about if i don't
 

317
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,270
yeah this is and how about if i don't
put enough

318
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
put enough
 

319
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,870
put enough
put the k in the last if i don't put ok

320
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
put the k in the last if i don't put ok
 

321
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,189
put the k in the last if i don't put ok
in the last

322
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
in the last
 

323
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,990
in the last
it means that it means what

324
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000

 

325
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,670

sorry if

327
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,189

if i don't put a number k

328
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
if i don't put a number k
 

329
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,749
if i don't put a number k
in the last position then how many

330
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
in the last position then how many
 

331
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,469
in the last position then how many
positions

332
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
positions
 

333
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:15,670
positions
can i put

334
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680

 

335
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,430

how many positions can i put is

336
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
how many positions can i put is
 

337
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,749
how many positions can i put is
okay so lazy will be because of this n

338
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
okay so lazy will be because of this n
 

339
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,589
okay so lazy will be because of this n
plus one i need to put it outside yeah

340
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
plus one i need to put it outside yeah
 

341
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:23,990
plus one i need to put it outside yeah
because

342
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
because
 

343
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,029
because
those together will be n minus one uh i

344
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
those together will be n minus one uh i
 

345
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:27,589
those together will be n minus one uh i
choose n

346
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
choose n
 

347
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,390
choose n
minus one positivities so that would be

348
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
minus one positivities so that would be
 

349
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:30,950
minus one positivities so that would be
plus

350
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
plus
 

351
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,790
plus
f what can you guess

352
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
f what can you guess
 

353
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,230
f what can you guess
okay no no there's no cages n

354
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
okay no no there's no cages n
 

355
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,589
okay no no there's no cages n
n minus one if i put it if i put the

356
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
n minus one if i put it if i put the
 

357
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,589
n minus one if i put it if i put the
number

358
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
number
 

359
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,830
number
if i i want to put that number n in the

360
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
if i i want to put that number n in the
 

361
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,589
if i i want to put that number n in the
first n minus one there's

362
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
first n minus one there's
 

363
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,670
first n minus one there's
n minus one i pick a number k and then k

364
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
n minus one i pick a number k and then k
 

365
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,670
n minus one i pick a number k and then k
can be put and the last

366
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
can be put and the last
 

367
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,230
can be put and the last
k can be put in the last and if okay put

368
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
k can be put in the last and if okay put
 

369
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,589
k can be put in the last and if okay put
it in the last that will be f

370
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
it in the last that will be f
 

371
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,589
it in the last that will be f
and minus two positions

372
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
and minus two positions
 

373
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,790
and minus two positions
yeah and then if i

374
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
yeah and then if i
 

375
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,589
yeah and then if i
if i don't put it in the k minus uh in

376
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
if i don't put it in the k minus uh in
 

377
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,830
if i don't put it in the k minus uh in
the last position that would be

378
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
the last position that would be
 

379
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,110
the last position that would be
something minus one n minus one i why is

380
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
something minus one n minus one i why is
 

381
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,510
something minus one n minus one i why is
it a minus one

382
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520

 

383
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,550

why is it a minus one so look if i don't

384
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
why is it a minus one so look if i don't
 

385
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,869
why is it a minus one so look if i don't
put it in

386
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
put it in
 

387
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,230
put it in
so if i don't put it in uh

388
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
so if i don't put it in uh
 

389
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,869
so if i don't put it in uh
well if i don't i don't put the k here

390
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
well if i don't i don't put the k here
 

391
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,870
well if i don't i don't put the k here
so how many positions can we put

392
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880

 

393
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,389

so it means that it means it means there

394
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
so it means that it means it means there
 

395
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:36,870
so it means that it means it means there
are n

396
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
are n
 

397
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,230
are n
minus one numbers can permute permutate

398
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
minus one numbers can permute permutate
 

399
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,909
minus one numbers can permute permutate
right do you get it

400
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
right do you get it
 

401
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,829
right do you get it
do you get it yep let's see let's see

402
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
do you get it yep let's see let's see
 

403
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,310
do you get it yep let's see let's see
if this is true okay f n minus 1 f minus

404
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
if this is true okay f n minus 1 f minus
 

405
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,389
if this is true okay f n minus 1 f minus
f n minus one okay so this is a bit

406
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
f n minus one okay so this is a bit
 

407
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,670
f n minus one okay so this is a bit
tricky to understand

408
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
tricky to understand
 

409
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,949
tricky to understand
so if i don't put i don't put the last

410
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
so if i don't put i don't put the last
 

411
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,550
so if i don't put i don't put the last
pull of k in the last number

412
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
pull of k in the last number
 

413
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,710
pull of k in the last number
if i don't put the number k in the last

414
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
if i don't put the number k in the last
 

415
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,829
if i don't put the number k in the last
number

416
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
number
 

417
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,870
number
so i have m minus 1

418
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
so i have m minus 1
 

419
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,389
so i have m minus 1
this is the the solution of n minus 1

420
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
this is the the solution of n minus 1
 

421
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,590
this is the the solution of n minus 1
right yeah is the solution of n

422
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
right yeah is the solution of n
 

423
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,389
right yeah is the solution of n
minus 1.

424
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399

 

425
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,710

okay so let's try let's see this let's

426
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
okay so let's try let's see this let's
 

427
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,670
okay so let's try let's see this let's
see this is

428
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
see this is
 

429
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,710
see this is
if it works okay so f

430
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
if it works okay so f
 

431
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,070
if it works okay so f
3 let's see f n equals

432
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
3 let's see f n equals
 

433
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,350
3 let's see f n equals
n minus 1 times

434
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
n minus 1 times
 

435
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:43,190
n minus 1 times
f n minus 2 plus f minus 1 right

436
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200

 

437
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,310

so let's see s3 equals 1

438
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320
so let's see s3 equals 1
 

439
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,670
so let's see s3 equals 1
equals 2 times 3 minus one two

440
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
equals 2 times 3 minus one two
 

441
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,870
equals 2 times 3 minus one two
two times f one

442
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
two times f one
 

443
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,269
two times f one
plus f two f one is zero f two is one

444
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
plus f two f one is zero f two is one
 

445
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,710
plus f two f one is zero f two is one
so that would be one so f will be two

446
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
so that would be one so f will be two
 

447
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,230
so that would be one so f will be two
so that is equal to way

448
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
so that is equal to way
 

449
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,430
so that is equal to way
two one no two three

450
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
two one no two three
 

451
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,550
two one no two three
one right okay this is one solution

452
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
one right okay this is one solution
 

453
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,389
one right okay this is one solution
how about three one two yeah

454
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
how about three one two yeah
 

455
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,150
how about three one two yeah
all right okay so that's the only two

456
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
all right okay so that's the only two
 

457
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,110
all right okay so that's the only two
solutions

458
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
solutions
 

459
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,350
solutions
yes can we look uh if i want to put the

460
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360

 

461
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,949

so look if i want to put the number

462
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
so look if i want to put the number
 

463
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,750
so look if i want to put the number
n the three so i can put it in if i want

464
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
n the three so i can put it in if i want
 

465
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,430
n the three so i can put it in if i want
to put a number three so i can put it

466
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
to put a number three so i can put it
 

467
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,430
to put a number three so i can put it
here and put it here that will be

468
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
here and put it here that will be
 

469
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,389
here and put it here that will be
two position yeah two every right look

470
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
two position yeah two every right look
 

471
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,590
two position yeah two every right look
it will be two

472
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
it will be two
 

473
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,870
it will be two
right when i put it here and then i can

474
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
right when i put it here and then i can
 

475
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,190
right when i put it here and then i can
swap it with two number two

476
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
swap it with two number two
 

477
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,949
swap it with two number two
so that would be f

478
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959

 

479
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,990

f one right that would be f one because

480
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
f one right that would be f one because
 

481
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,910
f one right that would be f one because
there's only one and then

482
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920

 

483
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,350

if if i uh

484
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
if if i uh
 

485
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,190
if if i uh
three i put it if i put it in a

486
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
three i put it if i put it in a
 

487
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,949
three i put it if i put it in a
k and k don't swap it with the last

488
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
k and k don't swap it with the last
 

489
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,110
k and k don't swap it with the last
position

490
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
position
 

491
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,870
position
don't swap it with the last position and

492
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
don't swap it with the last position and
 

493
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,150
don't swap it with the last position and
it will be

494
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
it will be
 

495
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,030
it will be
you'll be f what it'll be only one

496
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
you'll be f what it'll be only one
 

497
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,670
you'll be f what it'll be only one
positive

498
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
positive
 

499
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,509
positive
positivity right if f3 uh

500
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
positivity right if f3 uh
 

501
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,269
positivity right if f3 uh
this is the original place will be

502
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
this is the original place will be
 

503
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,949
this is the original place will be
number two

504
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
number two
 

505
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,269
number two
number two is here number two is here

506
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
number two is here number two is here
 

507
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,389
number two is here number two is here
and then if i

508
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
and then if i
 

509
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,750
and then if i
i'll put it here and then two can go

510
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
i'll put it here and then two can go
 

511
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,430
i'll put it here and then two can go
from if you go from the last one you'll

512
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
from if you go from the last one you'll
 

513
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,990
from if you go from the last one you'll
be here

514
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
be here
 

515
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,670
be here
right right if you go from

516
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
right right if you go from
 

517
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,030
right right if you go from
not the last one it will be it will be

518
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
not the last one it will be it will be
 

519
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,030
not the last one it will be it will be
in the f these two numbers

520
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
in the f these two numbers
 

521
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,829
in the f these two numbers
that would be two one right so that

522
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
that would be two one right so that
 

523
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,670
that would be two one right so that
would be a minus one

524
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
would be a minus one
 

525
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,590
would be a minus one
right will be n minus one you see

526
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
right will be n minus one you see
 

527
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,629
right will be n minus one you see
memorization because look if i if these

528
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
memorization because look if i if these
 

529
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,550
memorization because look if i if these
two doesn't go into the last position

530
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
two doesn't go into the last position
 

531
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,430
two doesn't go into the last position
look i pick a three here right

532
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
look i pick a three here right
 

533
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,190
look i pick a three here right
three i'm going to put this three i

534
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
three i'm going to put this three i
 

535
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,190
three i'm going to put this three i
choose any number of the first n i

536
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
choose any number of the first n i
 

537
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,190
choose any number of the first n i
for example i choose the number two

538
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
for example i choose the number two
 

539
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,430
for example i choose the number two
right so if i two

540
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
right so if i two
 

541
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,389
right so if i two
goes from the last one right goes from

542
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
goes from the last one right goes from
 

543
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,949
goes from the last one right goes from
the last one

544
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
the last one
 

545
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,550
the last one
then we don't have a solution because

546
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
then we don't have a solution because
 

547
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,430
then we don't have a solution because
look 3 2 and then the first one is 1

548
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
look 3 2 and then the first one is 1
 

549
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,629
look 3 2 and then the first one is 1
so that would be if it swapped with the

550
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
so that would be if it swapped with the
 

551
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,030
so that would be if it swapped with the
2

552
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
2
 

553
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,629
2
then the first the the solution would be

554
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
then the first the the solution would be
 

555
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,069
then the first the the solution would be
f three minus two would be f one right

556
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
f three minus two would be f one right
 

557
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,430
f three minus two would be f one right
f one would be zero right yes look

558
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
f one would be zero right yes look
 

559
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,550
f one would be zero right yes look
you see three i put a three i swap it

560
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
you see three i put a three i swap it
 

561
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,990
you see three i put a three i swap it
with two right

562
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
with two right
 

563
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,949
with two right
yeah and 2 can go to the last yeah slope

564
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
yeah and 2 can go to the last yeah slope
 

565
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,470
yeah and 2 can go to the last yeah slope
will be 3 yeah

566
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
will be 3 yeah
 

567
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,590
will be 3 yeah
yeah if i solve with 2

568
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
yeah if i solve with 2
 

569
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,590
yeah if i solve with 2
then the last the solution will be f 1

570
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
then the last the solution will be f 1
 

571
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,829
then the last the solution will be f 1
right you'll be only this one number f

572
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:51,839
right you'll be only this one number f
 

573
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,590
right you'll be only this one number f
one is zero because i can't put a one

574
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
one is zero because i can't put a one
 

575
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,310
one is zero because i can't put a one
here

576
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
here
 

577
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,550
here
in the first place all right if it

578
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
in the first place all right if it
 

579
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,310
in the first place all right if it
doesn't work with the number one then

580
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
doesn't work with the number one then
 

581
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,990
doesn't work with the number one then
they will be n minus two

582
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
they will be n minus two
 

583
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,550
they will be n minus two
because they are n minus two numbers or

584
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
because they are n minus two numbers or
 

585
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,870
because they are n minus two numbers or
n minus one numbers

586
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
n minus one numbers
 

587
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,790
n minus one numbers
for the n right yeah got it

588
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
for the n right yeah got it
 

589
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,230
for the n right yeah got it
look why why this is a minus one i just

590
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
look why why this is a minus one i just
 

591
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,150
look why why this is a minus one i just
look you understand this part yeah it's

592
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
look you understand this part yeah it's
 

593
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,430
look you understand this part yeah it's
a minus two yeah

594
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
a minus two yeah
 

595
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,629
a minus two yeah
yeah and what's this n minus one look

596
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
yeah and what's this n minus one look
 

597
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,389
yeah and what's this n minus one look
if i pick the number three put it in

598
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
if i pick the number three put it in
 

599
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,670
if i pick the number three put it in
here and two

600
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,680
here and two
 

601
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,190
here and two
doesn't go into the last then they are n

602
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
doesn't go into the last then they are n
 

603
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,470
doesn't go into the last then they are n
minus one right look

604
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
minus one right look
 

605
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,949
minus one right look
they are minus one which is two numbers

606
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
they are minus one which is two numbers
 

607
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,150
they are minus one which is two numbers
yeah

608
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
yeah
 

609
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,269
yeah
all right got it yeah okay so this is

610
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
all right got it yeah okay so this is
 

611
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,230
all right got it yeah okay so this is
what we call this is what do we call

612
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
what we call this is what do we call
 

613
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,509
what we call this is what do we call
dynamic programming transition function

614
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
dynamic programming transition function
 

615
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,670
dynamic programming transition function
or transition equation what's transition

616
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
or transition equation what's transition
 

617
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,949
or transition equation what's transition
from a state to another state because i

618
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
from a state to another state because i
 

619
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:53,910
from a state to another state because i
want to calculate f

620
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
want to calculate f
 

621
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,629
want to calculate f
n then i can calculate f of minimizer

622
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
n then i can calculate f of minimizer
 

623
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,150
n then i can calculate f of minimizer
look what's the difference between this

624
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
look what's the difference between this
 

625
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,069
look what's the difference between this
and fibonacci number

626
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
and fibonacci number
 

627
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,750
and fibonacci number
uh what's the difference

628
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
uh what's the difference
 

629
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,949
uh what's the difference
what's fibonacci number it's without

630
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
what's fibonacci number it's without
 

631
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,110
what's fibonacci number it's without
speed yeah

632
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
speed yeah
 

633
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,350
speed yeah
all right the difference between this

634
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
all right the difference between this
 

635
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,350
all right the difference between this
equation and a fibonacci number is

636
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
equation and a fibonacci number is
 

637
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,389
equation and a fibonacci number is
this bit correct

638
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
this bit correct
 

639
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,269
this bit correct
okay so look if we we don't know this

640
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
okay so look if we we don't know this
 

641
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,189
okay so look if we we don't know this
equation if we want to compute

642
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
equation if we want to compute
 

643
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,509
equation if we want to compute
if you want to try to find out how many

644
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
if you want to try to find out how many
 

645
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,670
if you want to try to find out how many
what's your proof of search remember

646
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
what's your proof of search remember
 

647
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,790
what's your proof of search remember
first try every possibility

648
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
first try every possibility
 

649
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,269
first try every possibility
right yeah and what's the how many

650
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
right yeah and what's the how many
 

651
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,430
right yeah and what's the how many
possibilities are they

652
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440

 

653
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,389

and what what's the complexity of the

654
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
and what what's the complexity of the
 

655
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,069
and what what's the complexity of the
proof force if i want to

656
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
proof force if i want to
 

657
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,910
proof force if i want to
try every possibilities and then check

658
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
try every possibilities and then check
 

659
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,230
try every possibilities and then check
and check if each one is a diff uh

660
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
and check if each one is a diff uh
 

661
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,389
and check if each one is a diff uh
derangement

662
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399

how many possibilities if the elements

664
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
how many possibilities if the elements
 

665
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,829
how many possibilities if the elements
the permutation third permutation

666
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839

 

667
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,670

n minus

668
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680

 

669
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,470

three numbers how many permutations

670
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
three numbers how many permutations
 

671
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,990
three numbers how many permutations
what's the possibility of the first

672
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
what's the possibility of the first
 

673
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,550
what's the possibility of the first
number

674
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
number
 

675
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,710
number
what's the possibility of second number

676
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
what's the possibility of second number
 

677
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,590
what's the possibility of second number
yeah so what's that

678
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
yeah so what's that
 

679
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,870
yeah so what's that
three times two times one what's that

680
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
three times two times one what's that
 

681
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,629
three times two times one what's that
three what three factors

682
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
three what three factors
 

683
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,550
three what three factors
yeah yeah so how many ends are totally

684
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
yeah yeah so how many ends are totally
 

685
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,710
yeah yeah so how many ends are totally
yes so n factorial

686
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720

 

687
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,470

for blue forcing all permutation right

688
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
for blue forcing all permutation right
 

689
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,310
for blue forcing all permutation right
and how to check if this one's

690
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
and how to check if this one's
 

691
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,990
and how to check if this one's
permutation is uh

692
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
permutation is uh
 

693
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,590
permutation is uh
different the arrangement or not

694
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
different the arrangement or not
 

695
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,590
different the arrangement or not
well you need to go through this

696
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:41,600
well you need to go through this
 

697
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,189
well you need to go through this
permutation once

698
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
permutation once
 

699
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,670
permutation once
to see if the original value is in the

700
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
to see if the original value is in the
 

701
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,110
to see if the original value is in the
original place right

702
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
original place right
 

703
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,430
original place right
if if it's a then it's not a valid

704
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
if if it's a then it's not a valid
 

705
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,949
if if it's a then it's not a valid
arrangement right

706
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
arrangement right
 

707
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,500
arrangement right
so what's the complexity of that

708
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:55,510
so what's the complexity of that
 

709
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,870
so what's the complexity of that
[Music]

710
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880

 

711
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,870

over all complexities all n factorial

712
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
over all complexities all n factorial
 

713
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,990
over all complexities all n factorial
times n this is huge this is too complex

714
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
times n this is huge this is too complex
 

715
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,030
times n this is huge this is too complex
it's not feasible for n equals 10 that

716
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
it's not feasible for n equals 10 that
 

717
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,069
it's not feasible for n equals 10 that
would be a lot

718
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
would be a lot
 

719
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,430
would be a lot
i mean right it's not feasible all right

720
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
i mean right it's not feasible all right
 

721
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,949
i mean right it's not feasible all right
so we can do this using dynamic

722
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
so we can do this using dynamic
 

723
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,990
so we can do this using dynamic
programming we just

724
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
programming we just
 

725
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,829
programming we just
prove an equation and we can just do

726
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
prove an equation and we can just do
 

727
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,230
prove an equation and we can just do
this can you tell me okay f

728
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
this can you tell me okay f
 

729
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,230
this can you tell me okay f
n column yeah if n equals 1

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,550
return y 0 yeah if
n equals 2

734
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560

 

735
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,590

yeah this is quite similar yeah we tend

736
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
yeah this is quite similar yeah we tend
 

737
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,430
yeah this is quite similar yeah we tend
n minus one yeah times

738
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440

what's missing here

744
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
what's missing here
 

745
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,030
what's missing here
it's not column okay what's amazing from

746
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
it's not column okay what's amazing from
 

747
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,150
it's not column okay what's amazing from
a cash

748
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
a cash
 

749
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,629
a cash
cash because if you know using the cash

750
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
cash because if you know using the cash
 

751
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,350
cash because if you know using the cash
what happened

752
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360
what happened
 

753
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,670
what happened
if at least intermediate numbers like

754
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
if at least intermediate numbers like
 

755
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,949
if at least intermediate numbers like
fibonacci number

756
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
fibonacci number
 

757
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,030
fibonacci number
will be calculated over and over again

758
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
will be calculated over and over again
 

759
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,350
will be calculated over and over again
and the time complexity because a

760
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
and the time complexity because a
 

761
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,669
and the time complexity because a
at each round is is exposed to

762
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
at each round is is exposed to
 

763
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,549
at each round is is exposed to
paths right the complexity will be o to

764
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
paths right the complexity will be o to
 

765
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,590
paths right the complexity will be o to
the power n right

766
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
the power n right
 

767
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,949
the power n right
this is still huge right yeah so we want

768
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
this is still huge right yeah so we want
 

769
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,870
this is still huge right yeah so we want
to add the cache

770
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:18,880
to add the cache
 

771
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,630
to add the cache
or the notebook yeah remember the

772
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
or the notebook yeah remember the
 

773
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,470
or the notebook yeah remember the
notebook without least

774
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
notebook without least
 

775
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,630
notebook without least
we with this the compiler the commuter

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
we with this the compiler the commuter
 

777
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,669
we with this the compiler the commuter
knows

778
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
knows
 

779
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,390
knows
if a computer calculates f 10 for

780
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
if a computer calculates f 10 for
 

781
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,029
if a computer calculates f 10 for
example

782
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
example
 

783
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,350
example
yeah the next time you can you are

784
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
yeah the next time you can you are
 

785
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,789
yeah the next time you can you are
asking for f10

786
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
asking for f10
 

787
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,150
asking for f10
you will return the value without

788
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160
you will return the value without
 

789
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,830
you will return the value without
calculating it right

790
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
calculating it right
 

791
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,950
calculating it right
yes so without the look with the

792
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
yes so without the look with the
 

793
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,669
yes so without the look with the
notebook

794
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
notebook
 

795
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,590
notebook
how do you do this a notebook yeah

796
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
how do you do this a notebook yeah
 

797
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,630
how do you do this a notebook yeah
and then you can just do this here yeah

798
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
and then you can just do this here yeah
 

799
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,830
and then you can just do this here yeah
uh you can just edit if and

800
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
uh you can just edit if and
 

801
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,270
uh you can just edit if and
in notebook yeah return

802
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
in notebook yeah return
 

803
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,950
in notebook yeah return
return what notebook end right and then

804
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
return what notebook end right and then
 

805
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,990
return what notebook end right and then
before you return you store this number

806
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
before you return you store this number
 

807
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,350
before you return you store this number
in a value all right in a value and then

808
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
in a value all right in a value and then
 

809
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,430
in a value all right in a value and then
you put it in the notebook yeah okay

810
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
you put it in the notebook yeah okay
 

811
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,909
you put it in the notebook yeah okay
and then return what reason what

812
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
and then return what reason what
 

813
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,830
and then return what reason what
i came to the value i put it in level

814
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:13,840
i came to the value i put it in level
 

815
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,150
i came to the value i put it in level
everything

816
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
everything
 

817
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,590
everything
no value yes okay

818
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
no value yes okay
 

819
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,909
no value yes okay
let's see minimization okay and how

820
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
let's see minimization okay and how
 

821
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,549
let's see minimization okay and how
about

822
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559

 

823
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,230

how about we're doing uh this is called

824
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
how about we're doing uh this is called
 

825
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,990
how about we're doing uh this is called
top-down dynamic programming how about

826
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
top-down dynamic programming how about
 

827
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,430
top-down dynamic programming how about
we're doing this bottom-up

828
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
we're doing this bottom-up
 

829
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,710
we're doing this bottom-up
mini programming okay all right look

830
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
mini programming okay all right look
 

831
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,789
mini programming okay all right look
it's been quick okay look 18 minutes

832
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
it's been quick okay look 18 minutes
 

833
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,669
it's been quick okay look 18 minutes
yeah yeah that's okay that's the same

834
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
yeah yeah that's okay that's the same
 

835
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,669
yeah yeah that's okay that's the same
yeah look let's do the same

836
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
yeah look let's do the same
 

837
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,150
yeah look let's do the same
return yellow e and equals to

838
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
return yellow e and equals to
 

839
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,590
return yellow e and equals to
return one okay

840
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:51,600
return one okay
 

841
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,230
return one okay
otherwise look otherwise look we have a

842
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
otherwise look otherwise look we have a
 

843
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,070
otherwise look otherwise look we have a
value dp value all right remember

844
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
value dp value all right remember
 

845
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,110
value dp value all right remember
this ddb alright look dt equals let's

846
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
this ddb alright look dt equals let's
 

847
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,830
this ddb alright look dt equals let's
say

848
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
say
 

849
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,750
say
zero times n minus n plus one okay

850
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
zero times n minus n plus one okay
 

851
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,750
zero times n minus n plus one okay
okay 19 minutes okay look look

852
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
okay 19 minutes okay look look
 

853
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,110
okay 19 minutes okay look look
look all right and then i need to set

854
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,120
look all right and then i need to set
 

855
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,230
look all right and then i need to set
the dp

856
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
the dp
 

857
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,390
the dp
two equals one okay and then i can do

858
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
two equals one okay and then i can do
 

859
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,350
two equals one okay and then i can do
this for

860
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
this for
 

861
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,870
this for
i let's say for i in

862
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
i let's say for i in
 

863
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,029
i let's say for i in
when start from the number three to end

864
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
when start from the number three to end
 

865
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,870
when start from the number three to end
my n plus one right

866
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:22,880
my n plus one right
 

867
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,950
my n plus one right
after n plus one then i can do this dp

868
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:26,960
after n plus one then i can do this dp
 

869
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,590
after n plus one then i can do this dp
i equals i minus one times

870
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
i equals i minus one times
 

871
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,950
i equals i minus one times
fbp i minus one

872
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:34,960
fbp i minus one
 

873
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,310
fbp i minus one
plus dp i minus two right yeah

874
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
plus dp i minus two right yeah
 

875
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,390
plus dp i minus two right yeah
this is basically we start from the tt

876
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
this is basically we start from the tt
 

877
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,909
this is basically we start from the tt
the number two

878
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:41,919
the number two
 

879
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,510
the number two
and calculate number three number four

880
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
and calculate number three number four
 

881
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,350
and calculate number three number four
number five until number n yeah

882
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,360
number five until number n yeah
 

883
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,029
number five until number n yeah
and then return the last value which is

884
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:47,039
and then return the last value which is
 

885
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,789
and then return the last value which is
tp1

886
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
tp1
 

887
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,549
tp1
db1 the last value of the array

888
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:53,559
db1 the last value of the array
 

889
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,029
db1 the last value of the array
minus one minus one last value always

890
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
minus one minus one last value always
 

891
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,909
minus one minus one last value always
okay

892
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
okay
 

893
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,669
okay
so look what's the time complexity

894
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
so look what's the time complexity
 

895
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,430
so look what's the time complexity
our n yeah because each value will only

896
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
our n yeah because each value will only
 

897
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,350
our n yeah because each value will only
calculate what's the space

898
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
calculate what's the space
 

899
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,669
calculate what's the space
n o n right because we're using the

900
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
n o n right because we're using the
 

901
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,549
n o n right because we're using the
right can we

902
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
right can we
 

903
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,750
right can we
do it without a array

904
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760
do it without a array
 

905
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,510
do it without a array
like fibonacci number we are not using

906
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
like fibonacci number we are not using
 

907
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,430
like fibonacci number we are not using
array right we can use the way but we're

908
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
array right we can use the way but we're
 

909
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,710
array right we can use the way but we're
not using array

910
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
not using array
 

911
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,590
not using array
all right look we can because look every

912
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
all right look we can because look every
 

913
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,350
all right look we can because look every
time we're calculating dpi

914
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,360
time we're calculating dpi
 

915
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,310
time we're calculating dpi
we only need how many values do we need

916
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,320
we only need how many values do we need
 

917
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,350
we only need how many values do we need
to calculate for

918
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
to calculate for
 

919
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,549
to calculate for
if we want to carry the value i

920
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:28,559
if we want to carry the value i
 

921
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,070
if we want to carry the value i
how many values do we need to calculate

922
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,080
how many values do we need to calculate
 

923
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,110
how many values do we need to calculate
i minus b p i minus one and d p my i

924
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
i minus b p i minus one and d p my i
 

925
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,710
i minus b p i minus one and d p my i
minus two so that's a value like the one

926
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
minus two so that's a value like the one
 

927
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,830
minus two so that's a value like the one
lasting number you can't give like a

928
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:37,840
lasting number you can't give like a
 

929
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,270
lasting number you can't give like a
fibonacci number like

930
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
fibonacci number like
 

931
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,270
fibonacci number like
uh the first two item is uh for example

932
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
uh the first two item is uh for example
 

933
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,669
uh the first two item is uh for example
there are two fibonacci numbers three

934
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
there are two fibonacci numbers three
 

935
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,630
there are two fibonacci numbers three
and four and what's in the next value

936
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640

 

937
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,950

what's the next value what's the

938
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
what's the next value what's the
 

939
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,350
what's the next value what's the
negative huh

940
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,360
negative huh
 

941
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,110
negative huh
what's the fibonacci number if the first

942
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
what's the fibonacci number if the first
 

943
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,590
what's the fibonacci number if the first
two item is three and four

944
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
two item is three and four
 

945
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,510
two item is three and four
the next two items next one item

946
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:03,520
the next two items next one item
 

947
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,430
the next two items next one item
seven yes you only need the three and

948
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:05,440
seven yes you only need the three and
 

949
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,750
seven yes you only need the three and
four you don't need you don't need to

950
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
four you don't need you don't need to
 

951
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,669
four you don't need you don't need to
take consideration of the previous yeah

952
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
take consideration of the previous yeah
 

953
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,669
take consideration of the previous yeah
up a preview to three yeah

954
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
up a preview to three yeah
 

955
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,510
up a preview to three yeah
yeah okay so for this is simple look

956
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
yeah okay so for this is simple look
 

957
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,870
yeah okay so for this is simple look
yeah so let's say a b equals

958
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
yeah so let's say a b equals
 

959
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,590
yeah so let's say a b equals
zero one right because we know the the

960
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
zero one right because we know the the
 

961
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,750
zero one right because we know the the
first item is zero the second number is

962
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:23,760
first item is zero the second number is
 

963
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,990
first item is zero the second number is
item is one and now we just need to do

964
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
item is one and now we just need to do
 

965
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,590
item is one and now we just need to do
this look

966
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
this look
 

967
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,630
this look
i three to n and a b

968
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
i three to n and a b
 

969
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,590
i three to n and a b
what's what's a what's the new a what's

970
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
what's what's a what's the new a what's
 

971
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,669
what's what's a what's the new a what's
the new a

972
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
the new a
 

973
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,470
the new a
you'll be the b right yeah exact simple

974
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,480
you'll be the b right yeah exact simple
 

975
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,950
you'll be the b right yeah exact simple
number

976
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:38,960
number
 

977
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,750
number
and what's the new b you'll be like

978
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
and what's the new b you'll be like
 

979
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,870
and what's the new b you'll be like
equation yeah

980
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:42,880
equation yeah
 

981
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,470
equation yeah
which is i minus 1 times

982
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
which is i minus 1 times
 

983
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,430
which is i minus 1 times
what times a plus b yeah look is it

984
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
what times a plus b yeah look is it
 

985
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,310
what times a plus b yeah look is it
exactly the same

986
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
exactly the same
 

987
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,230
exactly the same
except this yeah it's like a fibonacci

988
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,240
except this yeah it's like a fibonacci
 

989
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,430
except this yeah it's like a fibonacci
number except like i have

990
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
number except like i have
 

991
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,149
number except like i have
minus 1 here right remember the equation

992
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
minus 1 here right remember the equation
 

993
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:56,950
minus 1 here right remember the equation
yeah

994
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
yeah
 

995
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,230
yeah
and i can just return b yeah okay

996
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
and i can just return b yeah okay
 

997
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,310
and i can just return b yeah okay
what's the what's the station complexity

what's the time complexity how many

1008
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
what's the time complexity how many
 

1009
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,830
what's the time complexity how many
iterations do i need to go here

1010
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
iterations do i need to go here
 

1011
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,549

n and o n what's the space complexity

1012
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559

 

1013
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,870

this is a hard question what did i what

1014
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
this is a hard question what did i what
 

1015
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,470
this is a hard question what did i what
was that before i using the dp

1016
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
was that before i using the dp
 

1017
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,630
was that before i using the dp
all right that's one and i remove it

1018
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
all right that's one and i remove it
 

1019
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,789
all right that's one and i remove it
what's the complexity time complex

1020
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:30,799
what's the complexity time complex
 

1021
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,230
what's the complexity time complex
a one because there's no there is no

1022
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
a one because there's no there is no
 

1023
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,029
a one because there's no there is no
additional storage except those constant

1024
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
additional storage except those constant
 

1025
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,149
additional storage except those constant
variables i need

1026
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:38,159
variables i need
 

1027
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,870
variables i need
right i remove the storage right i don't

1028
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880
right i remove the storage right i don't
 

1029
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,430
right i remove the storage right i don't
really

1030
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,440
really
 

1031
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,590
really
know so this is very highly efficient

1032
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
know so this is very highly efficient
 

1033
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,950
know so this is very highly efficient
because it's very

1034
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
because it's very
 

1035
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,510
because it's very
fast yeah it does not have a recursion

1036
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
fast yeah it does not have a recursion
 

1037
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,710
fast yeah it does not have a recursion
it does not use the

1038
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
it does not use the
 

1039
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,750
it does not use the
remember when you use the cash

1040
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:51,760
remember when you use the cash
 

1041
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,789
remember when you use the cash
as long as you use the cash the notebook

1042
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
as long as you use the cash the notebook
 

1043
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,830
as long as you use the cash the notebook
what's the space complexity

1044
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:57,840
what's the space complexity
 

1045
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,270
what's the space complexity
if you're using the notebook what's the

1046
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,280
if you're using the notebook what's the
 

1047
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,350
if you're using the notebook what's the
spacing on yeah because right now we are

1048
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,360
spacing on yeah because right now we are
 

1049
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,870
spacing on yeah because right now we are
not using any

1050
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
not using any
 

1051
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,350
not using any
uh notebook thing so the space

1052
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:05,360
uh notebook thing so the space
 

1053
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,909
uh notebook thing so the space
complexity is one which is optimal the

1054
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
complexity is one which is optimal the
 

1055
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,230
complexity is one which is optimal the
constant and the time complexity is just

1056
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
constant and the time complexity is just
 

1057
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,029
constant and the time complexity is just
a loop for

1058
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,039
a loop for
 

1059
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,669
a loop for
o n so that's the optimum solution okay

1060
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
o n so that's the optimum solution okay
 

1061
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,830
o n so that's the optimum solution okay
yes uh

1062
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
yes uh
 

1063
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,909
yes uh
eric any questions do you understand

1064
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:21,919
eric any questions do you understand
 

1065
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,110
eric any questions do you understand
this problem

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
this problem
 

1067
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,990
this problem
the arrangement yeah okay let me give

1068
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,000
the arrangement yeah okay let me give
 

1069
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,630
the arrangement yeah okay let me give
you an example three two

1070
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:28,640
you an example three two
 

1071
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,470
you an example three two
uh one for is this a derangement

1072
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:32,480
uh one for is this a derangement
 

1073
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:41,750
uh one for is this a derangement
yeah what is

1074
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:41,760

 

1075

1077
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,430

it's not because four is in the original

1078
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
it's not because four is in the original
 

1079
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,149
it's not because four is in the original
place

1080
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:48,159
place
 

1081
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,269
place
how about this two days

1082
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:51,279
how about this two days
 

1083
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,029
how about this two days
yeah two is how about three two four

1084
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
yeah two is how about three two four
 

1085
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,310
yeah two is how about three two four
three two one

1086
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
three two one
 

1087
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,070
three two one
let's see it

1088
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080

 

1089

1091
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,669

this is because none of them are you

1092
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:03,679
this is because none of them are you
 

1093
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,350
this is because none of them are you
know original how about five numbers

1094
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
know original how about five numbers
 

1095
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,070
know original how about five numbers
like five

1096
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080
like five
 

1097
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,630
like five
four three two one say the arrangement

1098
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
four three two one say the arrangement
 

1099
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,590
four three two one say the arrangement
three is

1100
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
three is
 

1101
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,669
three is
three three is in so it's not a

1102
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
three three is in so it's not a
 

1103
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,350
three three is in so it's not a
derangement okay

1104
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
derangement okay
 

1105
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,590
derangement okay
so okay four five four number five five
