5 7 yeah
so what's the difference between this

32
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
so what's the difference between this
 

33
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,990
so what's the difference between this
group of number and this school for now

34
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000
group of number and this school for now
 

35
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,670
group of number and this school for now
no i mean these numbers belongs to

36
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
no i mean these numbers belongs to
 

37
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,709
no i mean these numbers belongs to
something and these numbers are on

38
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
something and these numbers are on
 

39
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,510
something and these numbers are on
other you know different group can you

40
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
other you know different group can you
 

41
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,950
other you know different group can you
make can you find the difference

42
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
make can you find the difference
 

43
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,430
make can you find the difference
uh that's the same thing similar thing

44
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
uh that's the same thing similar thing
 

45
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,869
uh that's the same thing similar thing
same police and

46
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
same police and
 

47
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,230
same police and

same police think about it
 

49
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,070
same police think about it
it has to be something to do with if you

50
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
it has to be something to do with if you
 

51
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,750
it has to be something to do with if you
can't you can turn the numbers

52
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
can't you can turn the numbers
 

53
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,830
can't you can turn the numbers
around

54
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840

 

55
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,030

okay and in this group these two these

56
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
okay and in this group these two these
 

57
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,870
okay and in this group these two these
three are belongs to the same

58
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
three are belongs to the same
 

59
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,149
three are belongs to the same
but not these two

60
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
but not these two
 

61
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,749
but not these two
make a guess that's weird

62
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
make a guess that's weird
 

63
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,950
make a guess that's weird
whatever yeah if you look numbers

64
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
whatever yeah if you look numbers
 

65
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,670
whatever yeah if you look numbers
upside down what happened

66
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680

 

67
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,390

if you look at the numbers upside down

68
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
if you look at the numbers upside down
 

69
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,950
if you look at the numbers upside down
so what

70
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
so what
 

71
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,149
so what
what which one still be the same eight

72
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
what which one still be the same eight
 

73
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,950
what which one still be the same eight
very one we're down but six nine will

74
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
very one we're down but six nine will
 

75
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,950
very one we're down but six nine will
become 96 yes

76
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
become 96 yes
 

77
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,870
become 96 yes
but how about you look the numbers

78
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
but how about you look the numbers
 

79
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,389
but how about you look the numbers
upside down

80
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
upside down
 

81
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,389
upside down
it doesn't make sense right this number

82
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
it doesn't make sense right this number
 

83
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,830
it doesn't make sense right this number
doesn't matter okay so that

84
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
doesn't matter okay so that
 

85
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,749
doesn't matter okay so that
that's the difference so for all those

86
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
that's the difference so for all those
 

87
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,030
that's the difference so for all those
five numbers

88
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
five numbers
 

89
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,030
five numbers
you can look it upside down it will

90
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
you can look it upside down it will
 

91
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,469
you can look it upside down it will
become a different number

92
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
become a different number
 

93
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,469
become a different number
but at least confusing digit i would say

94
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
but at least confusing digit i would say
 

95
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,910
but at least confusing digit i would say
please are invalid numbers so a number

96
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
please are invalid numbers so a number
 

97
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,190
please are invalid numbers so a number
is if it's a confusing number if

98
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
is if it's a confusing number if
 

99
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,390
is if it's a confusing number if
it's if you look it upside down

100
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
it's if you look it upside down
 

101
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,510
it's if you look it upside down
it's a valid number right like 89 if you

102
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
it's a valid number right like 89 if you
 

103
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,350
it's a valid number right like 89 if you
look it upside down you become

104
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
look it upside down you become
 

105
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,470
look it upside down you become
86 68 68 yes

106
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
86 68 68 yes
 

107
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,270
86 68 68 yes
what look you're looking this way 60

108
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
what look you're looking this way 60
 

109
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,150
what look you're looking this way 60
yeah yeah

110
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
yeah yeah
 

111
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,390
yeah yeah
you have to it's like these are 10

112
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
you have to it's like these are 10
 

113
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,710
you have to it's like these are 10
around 180 degrees right

114
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
around 180 degrees right
 

115
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,030
around 180 degrees right
so look if you turn around it's still a

116
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
so look if you turn around it's still a
 

117
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,150
so look if you turn around it's still a
very number

118
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
very number
 

119
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,550
very number
and it's not the same as origin number

120
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
and it's not the same as origin number
 

121
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,910
and it's not the same as origin number
it's a confusion number

122
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
it's a confusion number
 

123
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,430
it's a confusion number
so look if it's one i'm not confusing

124
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
so look if it's one i'm not confusing
 

125
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,470
so look if it's one i'm not confusing
i'm an understanding number look if you

126
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
i'm an understanding number look if you
 

127
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:46,869
i'm an understanding number look if you
want

128
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
want
 

129
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,150
want
turn around what will happen it is tier

130
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
turn around what will happen it is tier
 

131
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,110
turn around what will happen it is tier
one right

132
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
one right
 

133
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,509
one right
and then this is not confusing okay and

134
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
and then this is not confusing okay and
 

135
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,790
and then this is not confusing okay and
how about this

136
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
how about this
 

137
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,830
how about this
23 23

138
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
23 23
 

139
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,110
23 23
when you make turn around it comes like

140
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
when you make turn around it comes like
 

141
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,470
when you make turn around it comes like
five no no no it's invalid because

142
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
five no no no it's invalid because
 

143
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,030
five no no no it's invalid because
one three and two turn around it doesn't

144
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
one three and two turn around it doesn't
 

145
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,949
one three and two turn around it doesn't
make sense it's not red number so this

146
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
make sense it's not red number so this
 

147
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,830
make sense it's not red number so this
is not confusing

148
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
is not confusing
 

149
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,949
is not confusing
also to sum up a confusing number is

150
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
also to sum up a confusing number is
 

151
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,949
also to sum up a confusing number is
when you look it up right now it's still

152
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
when you look it up right now it's still
 

153
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,589
when you look it up right now it's still
a ready number but it's different than

154
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
a ready number but it's different than
 

155
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,949
a ready number but it's different than
the original number like we call it

156
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
the original number like we call it
 

157
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,149
the original number like we call it
confusing okay

158
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
confusing okay
 

159
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,149
confusing okay
confusing yeah does it make sense

160
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
confusing yeah does it make sense
 

161
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,190
confusing yeah does it make sense
yes yes so how are we doing this

162
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
yes yes so how are we doing this
 

163
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,910
yes yes so how are we doing this
default definitely so first of all we

164
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
default definitely so first of all we
 

165
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,910
default definitely so first of all we
need the functions to tell if the number

166
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
need the functions to tell if the number
 

167
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,630
need the functions to tell if the number
can be looked

168
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
can be looked
 

169
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,110
can be looked
up strong upside down right and if we

170
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
up strong upside down right and if we
 

171
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,670
up strong upside down right and if we
can

172
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
can
 

173
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,750
can
now we can turn it if not we can turn

174
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
now we can turn it if not we can turn
 

175
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,750
now we can turn it if not we can turn
back to something like minus one right

176
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
back to something like minus one right
 

177
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:57,350
back to something like minus one right
all right okay i'm not a confused

178
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360

 

179
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,910

maybe maybe just just make it just say

180
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
maybe maybe just just make it just say
 

181
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,630
maybe maybe just just make it just say
10 okay

182
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
10 okay
 

183
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,390
10 okay
10 x

184
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
10 x
 

185
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,350
10 x
all right okay y if you should be

186
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
all right okay y if you should be
 

187
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,550
all right okay y if you should be
confusing number

188
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
confusing number
 

189
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,470
confusing number
wait this is the hyper function we're

190
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
wait this is the hyper function we're
 

191
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,070
wait this is the hyper function we're
going to make okay if

192
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
going to make okay if
 

193
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,750
going to make okay if
if x equals 1 or

194
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
if x equals 1 or
 

195
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,870
if x equals 1 or
x equals 0 or x

196
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
x equals 0 or x
 

197
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,230
x equals 0 or x
equals a what should we return what

198
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
equals a what should we return what
 

199
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,350
equals a what should we return what
if x equals 1 or x equals 0 or x equals

200
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
if x equals 1 or x equals 0 or x equals
 

201
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,150
if x equals 1 or x equals 0 or x equals
a because

202
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
a because
 

203
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,150
a because
x yeah we're done because when you look

204
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
x yeah we're done because when you look
 

205
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,310
x yeah we're done because when you look
upside down it's the same yeah

206
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
upside down it's the same yeah
 

207
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,590
upside down it's the same yeah
yeah okay so if x equals

208
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
yeah okay so if x equals
 

209
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,950
yeah okay so if x equals
six what will be ten

210
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
six what will be ten
 

211
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,830
six what will be ten
nine we're done and if x equals nine

212
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
nine we're done and if x equals nine
 

213
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,510
nine we're done and if x equals nine
six

214
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520

 

215
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,430

we return a minus one to say it's in

216
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
we return a minus one to say it's in
 

217
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,030
we return a minus one to say it's in
value yeah if it's all

218
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
value yeah if it's all
 

219
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,629
value yeah if it's all
other numbers like two three five seven

220
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
other numbers like two three five seven
 

221
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,990
other numbers like two three five seven
yeah and what what uh what whatever four

222
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
yeah and what what uh what whatever four
 

223
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,790
yeah and what what uh what whatever four
two three four five seven then three

224
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
two three four five seven then three
 

225
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,430
two three four five seven then three
here is

226
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
here is
 

227
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,629
here is
two three four five

228
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
two three four five
 

229
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,310
two three four five
seven yeah these five numbers will

230
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
seven yeah these five numbers will
 

231
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,390
seven yeah these five numbers will
determine minus one because it's invalid

232
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
determine minus one because it's invalid
 

233
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,510
determine minus one because it's invalid
i'm right

234
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
i'm right
 

235
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,029
i'm right
yes okay so now now we got this turn

236
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
yes okay so now now we got this turn
 

237
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,430
yes okay so now now we got this turn
okay

238
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
okay
 

239
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,390
okay
make sure we we we remember that and

240
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
make sure we we we remember that and
 

241
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,390
make sure we we we remember that and
then

242
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
then
 

243
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,670
then
define love so let's say if

244
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
define love so let's say if
 

245
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,189
define love so let's say if
uh confusing let's confusion we return

246
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
uh confusing let's confusion we return
 

247
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,070
uh confusing let's confusion we return
true or false okay

248
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
true or false okay
 

249
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,830
true or false okay
let's say n okay

250
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840

 

251
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,150

okay so what we need this is the number

252
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
okay so what we need this is the number
 

253
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,990
okay so what we need this is the number
we need to take we need to

254
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
we need to take we need to
 

255
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,110
we need to take we need to
convert it into string to be able to

256
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
convert it into string to be able to
 

257
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,830
convert it into string to be able to
extract hcg

258
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
extract hcg
 

259
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,990
extract hcg
we can divide by 10 and get a remainder

260
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
we can divide by 10 and get a remainder
 

261
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,870
we can divide by 10 and get a remainder
yeah

262
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
yeah
 

263
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,670
yeah
yeah okay so let's do this let's do the

264
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
yeah okay so let's do this let's do the
 

265
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:43,909
yeah okay so let's do this let's do the
n

266
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
n
 

267
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,749
n
equal str

268
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759

 

269
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,029

and so now we turn this number into a

270
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
and so now we turn this number into a
 

271
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,189
and so now we turn this number into a
string yeah start me streaming

272
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
string yeah start me streaming
 

273
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,390
string yeah start me streaming
man yeah okay now

274
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
man yeah okay now
 

275
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,749
man yeah okay now
now let's go let's confirm uh conver

276
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
now let's go let's confirm uh conver
 

277
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,870
now let's go let's confirm uh conver
stories these into uh

278
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
stories these into uh
 

279
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,990
stories these into uh
the new new com let's

280
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
the new new com let's
 

281
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,629
the new new com let's
uh store the upside down value in a

282
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
uh store the upside down value in a
 

283
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,990
uh store the upside down value in a
string into this okay

284
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
string into this okay
 

285
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,350
string into this okay
answer and then let's say four

286
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
answer and then let's say four
 

287
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,870
answer and then let's say four
i in n okay so now we are getting each

288
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
i in n okay so now we are getting each
 

289
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,629
i in n okay so now we are getting each
digit for example one

290
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
digit for example one
 

291
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,870
digit for example one
a nine okay one eight nine yeah yeah

292
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
a nine okay one eight nine yeah yeah
 

293
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,670
a nine okay one eight nine yeah yeah
i'll be

294
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
i'll be
 

295
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,189
i'll be
six okay one now let's say x

296
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
six okay one now let's say x
 

297
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,710
six okay one now let's say x
equals ten yeah yeah we're turning this

298
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
equals ten yeah yeah we're turning this
 

299
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,510
equals ten yeah yeah we're turning this
yeah

300
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
yeah
 

301
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,029
yeah
but this is this is uh accepting this

302
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
but this is this is uh accepting this
 

303
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,629
but this is this is uh accepting this
number so we need to convert it back

304
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
number so we need to convert it back
 

305
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,550
number so we need to convert it back
integer i

306
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
integer i
 

307
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,670
integer i
i so now look

308
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
i so now look
 

309
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,189
i so now look
if x equal equals minus one what should

310
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
if x equal equals minus one what should
 

311
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,700
if x equal equals minus one what should
we do

312
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:44,710
we do
 

313
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,469
we do
[Music]

314
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
[Music]
 

315
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:57,510
[Music]
pretend

316
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520

 

317
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,510

this one a9 is bigger and yeah when we

318
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
this one a9 is bigger and yeah when we
 

319
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,110
this one a9 is bigger and yeah when we
do this strn

320
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
do this strn
 

321
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,110
do this strn
it becomes this smaller lowercase and

322
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
it becomes this smaller lowercase and
 

323
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,710
it becomes this smaller lowercase and
you become a string yeah

324
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
you become a string yeah
 

325
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,029
you become a string yeah
and then we're going to do this for i in

326
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
and then we're going to do this for i in
 

327
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,390
and then we're going to do this for i in
n then we get each

328
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
n then we get each
 

329
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,469
n then we get each
each digit will be 1 a

330
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:12,479
each digit will be 1 a
 

331
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,670
each digit will be 1 a
9 yeah and then we pass it into these

332
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
9 yeah and then we pass it into these
 

333
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,110
9 yeah and then we pass it into these
because then we need to convert this

334
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
because then we need to convert this
 

335
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,510
because then we need to convert this
string to numbers

336
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
string to numbers
 

337
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,390
string to numbers
yeah using this in function yeah in the

338
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
yeah using this in function yeah in the
 

339
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,430
yeah using this in function yeah in the
function

340
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
function
 

341
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,749
function
and then if it returns minus one then we

342
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
and then if it returns minus one then we
 

343
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,870
and then if it returns minus one then we
can make it

344
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
can make it
 

345
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,990
can make it
yeah nan alternatively

346
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
yeah nan alternatively
 

347
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,790
yeah nan alternatively
yeah alternating to you if we as we

348
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
yeah alternating to you if we as we
 

349
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,550
yeah alternating to you if we as we
changing this to

350
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
changing this to
 

351
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,550
changing this to
accepting string then we can do this

352
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
accepting string then we can do this
 

353
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,710
accepting string then we can do this
look we need to put this chord yeah

354
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
look we need to put this chord yeah
 

355
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,350
look we need to put this chord yeah
all right look if we place okay and then

356
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
all right look if we place okay and then
 

357
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,909
all right look if we place okay and then
it will be

358
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
it will be
 

359
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,629
it will be
become easier right yeah because

360
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
become easier right yeah because
 

361
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,869
become easier right yeah because
everything is in string yeah

362
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
everything is in string yeah
 

363
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,990
everything is in string yeah
okay yes and then now

364
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000

 

365
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,589

we don't need to convert it to an

366
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
we don't need to convert it to an
 

367
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,909
we don't need to convert it to an
integer we just pass this i because it's

368
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
integer we just pass this i because it's
 

369
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,869
integer we just pass this i because it's
already integer

370
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
already integer
 

371
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,270
already integer
and if we add into minus one we put a

372
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
and if we add into minus one we put a
 

373
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,790
and if we add into minus one we put a
curve left because this is

374
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
curve left because this is
 

375
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,749
curve left because this is
string type return false otherwise

376
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
string type return false otherwise
 

377
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,869
string type return false otherwise
answer

378
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
answer
 

379
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,790
answer
equals x plus answer yeah so we put this

380
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
equals x plus answer yeah so we put this
 

381
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,070
equals x plus answer yeah so we put this
new number before

382
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
new number before
 

383
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,469
new number before
in the front so you will be opposite

384
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
in the front so you will be opposite
 

385
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,110
in the front so you will be opposite
yeah

386
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
yeah
 

387
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,309
yeah
and then after that return

388
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
and then after that return
 

389
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,150
and then after that return
answer equal or not equal

390
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
answer equal or not equal
 

391
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,909
answer equal or not equal
n what's your what's your input here

392
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
n what's your what's your input here
 

393
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,990
n what's your what's your input here
equal or not equal

394
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
equal or not equal
 

395
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,869
equal or not equal
if it's a valid number uh if it's a

396
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
if it's a valid number uh if it's a
 

397
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,469
if it's a valid number uh if it's a
confusing number it's

398
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
confusing number it's
 

399
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,709
confusing number it's
true equal or not equal

400
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
true equal or not equal
 

401
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,630
true equal or not equal
not equal yeah because it's confusing

402
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
not equal yeah because it's confusing
 

403
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,990
not equal yeah because it's confusing
yeah not equal

404
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
yeah not equal
 

405
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,110
yeah not equal
so does that make sense yes

406
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
so does that make sense yes
 

407
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,190
so does that make sense yes
yes what's the term complexity if there

408
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
yes what's the term complexity if there
 

409
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,110
yes what's the term complexity if there
are n numbers and digits in the

410
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
are n numbers and digits in the
 

411
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,310
are n numbers and digits in the
n something oh and yeah if if

412
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
n something oh and yeah if if
 

413
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,110
n something oh and yeah if if
n is the number of digits in there in a

414
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
n is the number of digits in there in a
 

415
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,710
n is the number of digits in there in a
string

416
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
string
 

417
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,389
string
number yeah okay so

418
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
number yeah okay so
 

419
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,509
number yeah okay so
uh what what's the time context

420
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
uh what what's the time context
 

421
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,310
uh what what's the time context
you always know i just told you well

422
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
you always know i just told you well
 

423
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,630
you always know i just told you well
yeah space complexity do we are we using

424
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
yeah space complexity do we are we using
 

425
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,990
yeah space complexity do we are we using
any space complex

426
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
any space complex
 

427
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,150
any space complex
space here

428
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160

 

429
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,870

this could be a space yes we convert

430
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
this could be a space yes we convert
 

431
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,269
this could be a space yes we convert
into

432
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
into
 

433
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,790
into
string

434
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800

 

435
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,550

we are using that yeah yeah okay so

436
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
we are using that yeah yeah okay so

you don't need an inner because i
 

467
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,670
you don't need an inner because i
already changed here okay x equals 10

468

yeah
so what do we do answer equals what

490
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
so what do we do answer equals what
 

491
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,630
so what do we do answer equals what
what are we doing here

492
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
what are we doing here
 

493
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,750
what are we doing here
this x thing if it's counting yeah

494
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
this x thing if it's counting yeah
 

495
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,110
this x thing if it's counting yeah
x squared x y minus

496
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
x squared x y minus
 

497
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,230
x squared x y minus
where's y equals equals we need to put

498
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
where's y equals equals we need to put
 

499
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,630
where's y equals equals we need to put
it a pen so what's the append

500
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
it a pen so what's the append
 

501
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,350
it a pen so what's the append
