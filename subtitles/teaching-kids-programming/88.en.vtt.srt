in the number in in the list
 

39
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,910
in the number in in the list
three no four five no

40
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
three no four five no
 

41
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,029
three no four five no
seven no so yes two yeah yeah i said two

42
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
seven no so yes two yeah yeah i said two
 

43
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,950
seven no so yes two yeah yeah i said two
yeah got it do you do you understand so

44
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
yeah got it do you do you understand so
 

45
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,470
yeah got it do you do you understand so
this is what you want to count

46
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
this is what you want to count
 

47
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,310
this is what you want to count
doesn't have to be an order no it

48
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
doesn't have to be an order no it
 

49
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,590
doesn't have to be an order no it
doesn't have a connex

50
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
doesn't have a connex
 

51
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,869
doesn't have a connex
number of context elements so basically

52
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
number of context elements so basically
 

53
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,710
number of context elements so basically
we want to find out how many numbers in

54
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
we want to find out how many numbers in
 

55
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,830
we want to find out how many numbers in
the array

56
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
the array
 

57
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,030
the array
[Music]

58
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
[Music]
 

59
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,270
[Music]
how many numbers in the array that it's

60
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
how many numbers in the array that it's
 

61
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,070
how many numbers in the array that it's
next it's plus one it's also an array

62
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
next it's plus one it's also an array
 

63
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,270
next it's plus one it's also an array
okay any ideas

64
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
okay any ideas
 

65
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,350
okay any ideas
how we can do it we we do the first

66
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
how we can do it we we do the first
 

67
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,230
how we can do it we we do the first
number

68
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
number
 

69
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,510
number
then we go through the rate and see

70
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
then we go through the rate and see
 

71
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,550
then we go through the rate and see
if it's any number plus one do that

72
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
if it's any number plus one do that
 

73
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,109
if it's any number plus one do that
number

74
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
number
 

75
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,590
number
yeah that's a good pro approach uh in

76
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
yeah that's a good pro approach uh in
 

77
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,270
yeah that's a good pro approach uh in
the beginning this is called blue fox

78
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
the beginning this is called blue fox
 

79
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,830
the beginning this is called blue fox
yeah

80
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
yeah
 

81
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,910
yeah
blue four brute force

82
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
blue four brute force
 

83
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,429
blue four brute force
so very intuitively like we iterate this

84
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
so very intuitively like we iterate this
 

85
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,550
so very intuitively like we iterate this
number yeah

86
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
number yeah
 

87
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,950
number yeah
and then we iterate again to find out if

88
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
and then we iterate again to find out if
 

89
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,990
and then we iterate again to find out if
next one is

90
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
next one is
 

91
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,109
next one is
is in a array right yes so

92
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
is in a array right yes so
 

93
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,830
is in a array right yes so
let's do this define okay let's say

94
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840

 

95
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,860

okay

96
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:56,870

yeah four look

102
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
yeah four look
 

103
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,790
yeah four look
we go through this number once yeah and

104
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
we go through this number once yeah and
 

105
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,030
we go through this number once yeah and
then we need to go through it again yeah

106
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
then we need to go through it again yeah
 

107
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,470
then we need to go through it again yeah
anonymous look if

108
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
anonymous look if
 

109
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,150
anonymous look if
they yeah

110
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,160
they yeah

113
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,030

is equals to i plus one

114
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040

 

115
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,150

answer one add

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
one answer add one yeah yeah
 

119
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,509
one answer add one yeah yeah
return answer right yeah

120
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519

 

121
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,550

will that work will i work

122
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
will that work will i work
 

123
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,350
will that work will i work
look let's try i will be one and then i

124
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
look let's try i will be one and then i
 

125
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,390
look let's try i will be one and then i
try

126
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
try
 

127
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,430
try
one two okay i plus one yeah you know

128
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
one two okay i plus one yeah you know
 

129
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,910
one two okay i plus one yeah you know
i plus one because j is equal to i one

130
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
i plus one because j is equal to i one
 

131
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,350
i plus one because j is equal to i one
yeah now i'm here i

132
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
yeah now i'm here i
 

133
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,430
yeah now i'm here i
yeah j j star from i yeah

134
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
yeah j j star from i yeah
 

135
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,830
yeah j j star from i yeah
it doesn't equal it doesn't this

136
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
it doesn't equal it doesn't this
 

137
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,869
it doesn't equal it doesn't this
condition is not

138
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
condition is not
 

139
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,149
condition is not
met because j is equal to i right

140
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
met because j is equal to i right
 

141
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,630
met because j is equal to i right
j will be here two equals one plus one

142
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
j will be here two equals one plus one
 

143
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,270
j will be here two equals one plus one
yeah

144
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
yeah
 

145
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,470
yeah
so answer is one and then it doesn't

146
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
so answer is one and then it doesn't
 

147
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,910
so answer is one and then it doesn't
meet okay and then i

148
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
meet okay and then i
 

149
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,070
meet okay and then i
too right three here yeah

150
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
too right three here yeah
 

151
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,830
too right three here yeah
no okay here three plus one

152
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
no okay here three plus one
 

153
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,550
no okay here three plus one
two okay three one

154
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560

 

155
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,350

so yeah it will work how about if we can

156
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
so yeah it will work how about if we can
 

157
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,430
so yeah it will work how about if we can
have these duplicate numbers

158
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
have these duplicate numbers
 

159
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,910
have these duplicate numbers
like if we have uh another two here does

160
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
like if we have uh another two here does
 

161
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,110
like if we have uh another two here does
it work

162
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
it work
 

163
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,350
it work
one one two two so you pass two two

164
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
one one two two so you pass two two
 

165
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,830
one one two two so you pass two two
times

166
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
times
 

167
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,630
times
okay and then two

168
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
okay and then two
 

169
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,550
okay and then two
two

170
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560

 

171
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,429

for one yeah and then yeah yeah it will

172
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
for one yeah and then yeah yeah it will
 

173
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:55,750
for one yeah and then yeah yeah it will
work

174
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
work
 

175
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,190
work
okay so basically you'll find these

176
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
okay so basically you'll find these
 

177
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,949
okay so basically you'll find these
pairs i and j

178
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
pairs i and j
 

179
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,990
pairs i and j
you will find this pair i and j yeah and

180
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
you will find this pair i and j yeah and
 

181
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,429
you will find this pair i and j yeah and
if i

182
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
if i
 

183
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,789
if i
j is i i plus one so i basically i

184
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
j is i i plus one so i basically i
 

185
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,910
j is i i plus one so i basically i
i plus one this pair in the

186
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
i plus one this pair in the
 

187
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:26,550
i plus one this pair in the
array so what's the time complexity i

188
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560

 

189
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,629

i hit that look this is look

190
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
i hit that look this is look
 

191
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,189
i hit that look this is look
n times yeah i go to this end for each n

192
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
n times yeah i go to this end for each n
 

193
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,030
n times yeah i go to this end for each n
i need to go through n times again right

194
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
i need to go through n times again right
 

195
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,430
i need to go through n times again right
yeah

196
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
yeah
 

197
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,629
yeah
can we do better uh

198
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
can we do better uh
 

199
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,790
can we do better uh
n times then no it's not look

200
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
n times then no it's not look
 

201
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,430
n times then no it's not look
remember the n times n is like that yeah

202
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
remember the n times n is like that yeah
 

203
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,070
remember the n times n is like that yeah
n times

204
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
n times
 

205
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,350
n times
n is this graph look and what

206
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
n is this graph look and what
 

207
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,990
n is this graph look and what
yeah look this is n and then this n

208
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
yeah look this is n and then this n
 

209
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,270
yeah look this is n and then this n
times n yeah

210
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
times n yeah
 

211
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,310
times n yeah
so look when n is a hundred and then the

212
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
so look when n is a hundred and then the
 

213
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,070
so look when n is a hundred and then the
n times n would be

214
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
n times n would be
 

215
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,189
n times n would be
what what's this number ten thousand ten

216
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
what what's this number ten thousand ten
 

217
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,230
what what's this number ten thousand ten
thousand and when

218
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
thousand and when
 

219
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,350
thousand and when
n is a thousand that will be another

220
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
n is a thousand that will be another
 

221
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,310
n is a thousand that will be another
three zero yeah

222
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
three zero yeah
 

223
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,870
three zero yeah
so that would be what's this number a

224
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
so that would be what's this number a
 

225
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,150
so that would be what's this number a
minion yeah

226
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
minion yeah
 

227
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,270
minion yeah
yeah so look when n is a thousand it's

228
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
yeah so look when n is a thousand it's
 

229
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,270
yeah so look when n is a thousand it's
already a million so it's a lot so n

230
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
already a million so it's a lot so n
 

231
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,469
already a million so it's a lot so n
square is not very good

232
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
square is not very good
 

233
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,310
square is not very good
right look n square this is square this

234
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
right look n square this is square this
 

235
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,870
right look n square this is square this
is n it's very slow do you get it

236
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
is n it's very slow do you get it
 

237
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,070
is n it's very slow do you get it
right okay so how how

238
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
right okay so how how
 

239
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,430
right okay so how how
can we do better i'll give you a hint

240
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
can we do better i'll give you a hint
 

241
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,710
can we do better i'll give you a hint
the notebook yeah

242
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
the notebook yeah
 

243
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,189
the notebook yeah
the third one in the network so because

244
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
the third one in the network so because
 

245
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:33,830
the third one in the network so because
look

246
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
look
 

247
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,469
look
we can do this we can go through these

248
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
we can do this we can go through these
 

249
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,510
we can do this we can go through these
numbers

250
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
numbers
 

251
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,510
numbers
and then put it in a notebook yeah and

252
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
and then put it in a notebook yeah and
 

253
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,029
and then put it in a notebook yeah and
then we can just check

254
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
then we can just check
 

255
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,790
then we can just check
check if the next number is in the old

256
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
check if the next number is in the old
 

257
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,390
check if the next number is in the old
book notebook and that

258
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
book notebook and that
 

259
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,510
book notebook and that
only costs you all one constant right

260
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
only costs you all one constant right
 

261
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,390
only costs you all one constant right
previously we use another for loop this

262
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
previously we use another for loop this
 

263
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,270
previously we use another for loop this
is takes o

264
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
is takes o
 

265
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,469
is takes o
n time right yeah am i right yeah

266
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
n time right yeah am i right yeah
 

267
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,590
n time right yeah am i right yeah
do you realize the difference so look i

268
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
do you realize the difference so look i
 

269
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,390
do you realize the difference so look i
show you look

270
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
show you look
 

271
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,990
show you look
define f launch

272
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
define f launch
 

273
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,270
define f launch
a notebook column okay let's call it d

274
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
a notebook column okay let's call it d
 

275
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,550
a notebook column okay let's call it d
equal set remember set yes

276
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
equal set remember set yes
 

277
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,830
equal set remember set yes
yes okay so now

278
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
yes okay so now
 

279
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,629
yes okay so now
actually we we can just set and we can

280
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
actually we we can just set and we can
 

281
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,990
actually we we can just set and we can
take the parameter numbers

282
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
take the parameter numbers
 

283
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,070
take the parameter numbers
so we put the numbers in the set so we

284
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
so we put the numbers in the set so we
 

285
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,990
so we put the numbers in the set so we
put all the numbers in in the notebook

286
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
put all the numbers in in the notebook
 

287
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,029
put all the numbers in in the notebook
right yeah then four

288
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
right yeah then four
 

289
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,550
right yeah then four
i in num

290
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
i in num
 

291
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,830
i in num
if i plus one right we want to check if

292
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
if i plus one right we want to check if
 

293
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,270
if i plus one right we want to check if
the next number right

294
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
the next number right
 

295
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,469
the next number right
right in

296
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
right in
 

297
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,670
right in
t answer plus

298
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
t answer plus
 

299
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,909
t answer plus
equals one right answer equals zero

300
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
equals one right answer equals zero
 

301
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,309
equals one right answer equals zero
and return answer correct

302
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
and return answer correct
 

303
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,990
and return answer correct
yeah what's the term complexity

304
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
yeah what's the term complexity
 

305
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,710
yeah what's the term complexity
what's the hapticity sorry um

306
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
what's the hapticity sorry um
 

307
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,230
what's the hapticity sorry um
look our n comes in

308
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
look our n comes in
 

309
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,589
look our n comes in
just o n what compare previously the

310
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
just o n what compare previously the
 

311
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:01,990
just o n what compare previously the
previous

312
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
previous
 

313
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,070
previous
method has this for loop as well but

314
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
method has this for loop as well but
 

315
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,469
method has this for loop as well but
another in order to check if the number

316
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
another in order to check if the number
 

317
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,150
another in order to check if the number
the plus one is in the in in the array

318
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,160
the plus one is in the in in the array
 

319
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,870
the plus one is in the in in the array
the previous method used another for

320
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
the previous method used another for
 

321
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,830
the previous method used another for
loop right

322
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
loop right
 

323
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,029
loop right
this is times n but now if i plus one in

324
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
this is times n but now if i plus one in
 

325
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:17,350
this is times n but now if i plus one in
d

326
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
d
 

327
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,550
d
this is a one so that will be all n

328
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
this is a one so that will be all n
 

329
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,550
this is a one so that will be all n
times this one will be o n n times one

330
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
times this one will be o n n times one
 

331
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,749
times this one will be o n n times one
yeah got it so do you see look

332
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
yeah got it so do you see look
 

333
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,629
yeah got it so do you see look
i plus one in d yeah this is called we

334
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
i plus one in d yeah this is called we
 

335
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,710
i plus one in d yeah this is called we
putting all the numbers in the notebook

336
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
putting all the numbers in the notebook
 

337
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,550
putting all the numbers in the notebook
in the notebook intercept and then we

338
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
in the notebook intercept and then we
 

339
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,150
in the notebook intercept and then we
just want to check if

340
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
just want to check if
 

341
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,070
just want to check if
i plus 1 is in the notebook we can do

342
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
i plus 1 is in the notebook we can do
 

343
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,830
i plus 1 is in the notebook we can do
this i plus 1 in d

344
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840
this i plus 1 in d
 

345
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,350
this i plus 1 in d
and that only costs you how many times

346
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
and that only costs you how many times
 

347
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,230
and that only costs you how many times
how much

348
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
how much
 

349
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,990
how much
complexity oh one this is a one yeah

350
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
complexity oh one this is a one yeah
 

351
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,430
complexity oh one this is a one yeah
correct yeah and we can also use the

352
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
correct yeah and we can also use the
 

353
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,469
correct yeah and we can also use the
counter remember we use the counter

354
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
counter remember we use the counter
 

355
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,390
counter remember we use the counter
look another one t equals counter

356
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
look another one t equals counter
 

357
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,230
look another one t equals counter
capital c how the numbers so

358
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
capital c how the numbers so
 

359
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,869
capital c how the numbers so
can you can you give give me example

360
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
can you can you give give me example
 

361
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,150
can you can you give give me example
what what's d now

362
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
what what's d now
 

363
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,110
what what's d now
b equals countless numbers what does it

364
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
b equals countless numbers what does it
 

365
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,830
b equals countless numbers what does it
what what's the

366
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
what what's the
 

367
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,869
what what's the
counter what what's counter mean

368
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
counter what what's counter mean
 

369
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,670
counter what what's counter mean
it's like a pointer no it calls the

370
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
it's like a pointer no it calls the
 

371
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,670
it's like a pointer no it calls the
numbers and how many times they appear

372
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
numbers and how many times they appear
 

373
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,950
numbers and how many times they appear
so i give you an example t

374
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
so i give you an example t
 

375
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,589
so i give you an example t
d will be a dictionary now yeah so

376
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
d will be a dictionary now yeah so
 

377
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,070
d will be a dictionary now yeah so
you'll be

378
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
you'll be
 

379

keys key is a unique unique
element in the array okay so look

412
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
element in the array okay so look
 

413
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,509
element in the array okay so look
there are only these kind of numbers 1 2

414
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
there are only these kind of numbers 1 2
 

415
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,550
there are only these kind of numbers 1 2
3 4

416

3 4
 

417
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,590
3 4
3 8 5 8 in the numbers yeah

418
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
3 8 5 8 in the numbers yeah
 

419
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,670
3 8 5 8 in the numbers yeah
and the values this is called the value

420
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
and the values this is called the value
 

421
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,110
and the values this is called the value
yeah

422
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
yeah
 

423
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,110
yeah
it's the number of times they appear

424
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
it's the number of times they appear
 

425
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,710
it's the number of times they appear
right yes

426
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
right yes
 

427
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,550
right yes
yeah because two appears twice i know

428
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
yeah because two appears twice i know
 

429
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,710
yeah because two appears twice i know
other elements appear once okay good job

430
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720
other elements appear once okay good job
 

431
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,829
other elements appear once okay good job
so now we we do this we have that d

432
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
so now we we do this we have that d
 

433
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,990
so now we we do this we have that d
structure and then how can we do this we

434
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
structure and then how can we do this we
 

435
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,110
structure and then how can we do this we
can just do this look

436
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
can just do this look
 

437
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,310
can just do this look
we can go through that for

438
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320

 

439
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,190

eric again we can go through this i in

440
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
eric again we can go through this i in
 

441
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,150
eric again we can go through this i in
numbers yeah

442
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
numbers yeah
 

443
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,750
numbers yeah
we can do this if i plus one in

444
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
we can do this if i plus one in
 

445
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,110
we can do this if i plus one in
we have before again in d no no no

446
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
we have before again in d no no no
 

447
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,190
we have before again in d no no no
no yeah this is four and another one is

448
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
no yeah this is four and another one is
 

449
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,630
no yeah this is four and another one is
look i plus one in d

450
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
look i plus one in d
 

451
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,870
look i plus one in d
on the same right then we talk answer

452
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
on the same right then we talk answer
 

453
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:11,910
on the same right then we talk answer
plus

454
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920

 

455
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,790

okay so now look we are going through

456
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
okay so now look we are going through
 

457
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,550
okay so now look we are going through
these numbers again but we can

458
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
these numbers again but we can
 

459
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,110
these numbers again but we can
we can we we we don't need to go through

460
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
we can we we we don't need to go through
 

461
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,550
we can we we we don't need to go through
these duplicate numbers right

462
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
these duplicate numbers right
 

463
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,790
these duplicate numbers right
look if you do leave for i in numbers

464
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
look if you do leave for i in numbers
 

465
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,829
look if you do leave for i in numbers
you'll go through the two

466
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
you'll go through the two
 

467
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,630
you'll go through the two
twice right we can we can just go

468
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
twice right we can we can just go
 

469
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,509
twice right we can we can just go
through these three

470
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
through these three
 

471
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,870
through these three
dot keys yeah yeah so if

472
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
dot keys yeah yeah so if
 

473
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,670
dot keys yeah yeah so if
i in d dot keys

474
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
i in d dot keys
 

475
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,870
i in d dot keys
right now we can say

476
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
right now we can say
 

477
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,509
right now we can say
if i plus one in

478
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
if i plus one in
 

479
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,430
if i plus one in
in d then we do this answer

480
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
in d then we do this answer
 

481
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,110
in d then we do this answer
plus equal what it's not answer plus

482
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
plus equal what it's not answer plus
 

483
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,750
plus equal what it's not answer plus
equals one one no it's not one again

484
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
equals one one no it's not one again
 

485
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,470
equals one one no it's not one again
because we only

486
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
because we only
 

487
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,590
because we only
we we iterate the two only once

488
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
we we iterate the two only once
 

489
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,590
we we iterate the two only once
so we need to add two instead of l1

490
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
so we need to add two instead of l1
 

491
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,430
so we need to add two instead of l1
right yeah the previous one we add we

492
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
right yeah the previous one we add we
 

493
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,030
right yeah the previous one we add we
iterate the number twice

494
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
iterate the number twice
 

495
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,509
iterate the number twice
so we can add one right so what's this

496
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
so we can add one right so what's this
 

497
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,470
so we can add one right so what's this
no

498
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
no
 

499
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,829
no
two it's it's not constant what's this

500
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839

 

501
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,430

d1
p what value i o i plus one

504
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
p what value i o i plus one
 

505
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,949
p what value i o i plus one
f not i

506
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
f not i
 

507
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,069
f not i
yeah look i i don't think two two has

508
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
yeah look i i don't think two two has
 

509
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,190

have two
two two two times of two so i need to

518
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
two two two times of two so i need to
 

519
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,150

add two right
 

521
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,829
add two right
yeah so this do you understand return

522
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839
yeah so this do you understand return
 

523
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,150
yeah so this do you understand return
one

524
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
one
 

525
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,509

529
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,750

do you want me to which method do you

530
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
do you want me to which method do you
 

531
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,790
do you want me to which method do you
remember

532
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
remember
 

533
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,030
remember
because i talk a lot a lot and which one

because i talk a lot a lot and which one
 

535
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,470
because i talk a lot a lot and which one
do you remember

536
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
do you remember
 

537
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,629
do you remember
remember happy number yeah

538
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639

 

539
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,910

okay so yeah yeah

540
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
okay so yeah yeah
 

541
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,550
okay so yeah yeah
wait wait okay good job so now

542
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
wait wait okay good job so now
 

543
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,750
wait wait okay good job so now
we we can also use the uh you know this

544
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
we we can also use the uh you know this
 

545
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,670
we we can also use the uh you know this
this is traditional way of you always

546
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
this is traditional way of you always
 

547
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,190
this is traditional way of you always
writing a for loop

548
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
writing a for loop
 

549
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,110
writing a for loop
the constant is uh the time complexity

550
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
the constant is uh the time complexity
 

551
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,870
the constant is uh the time complexity
is also always yeah

552
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
is also always yeah
 

553
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,430
is also always yeah
oh n yes and and we we can also

554
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
oh n yes and and we we can also
 

555
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,949
oh n yes and and we we can also
use the um

556
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959

 

557
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,949

use the

558
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959

 

559
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,590

uh use the sum object so look we can

560
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
uh use the sum object so look we can
 

561
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,629
uh use the sum object so look we can
have a d

562
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
have a d
 

563
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,230
have a d
and then we can just do this return

564
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
and then we can just do this return
 

565
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,590
and then we can just do this return
yeah we want to sum this sum yeah

566
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
yeah we want to sum this sum yeah
 

567
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,710
yeah we want to sum this sum yeah
sum

568
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720

 

569
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,790

v value yeah

570
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
v value yeah
 

571
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,230
v value yeah
uh for like a v uh

572
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
uh for like a v uh
 

573
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,470
uh for like a v uh
a v in

574
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
a v in
 

575
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,670
a v in
these dot items indeed

576
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
these dot items indeed
 

577
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,710
these dot items indeed
items look when you have additional

578
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
items look when you have additional
 

579
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,750
items look when you have additional
items it actually will be key and value

580
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
items it actually will be key and value
 

581
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,829
items it actually will be key and value
and value and if a

582
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
and value and if a
 

583
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,949
and value and if a
uh if a plus

584
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
uh if a plus
 

585
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,509
uh if a plus
a is the key a plus one in d

586
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
a is the key a plus one in d
 

587
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,990
a is the key a plus one in d
okay so let let's see um

588
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000

 

589
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,590

yeah so do you see it look

590
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
yeah so do you see it look
 

591
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,990
yeah so do you see it look
this is a this is a very fancy syntax

592
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
this is a this is a very fancy syntax
 

593
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,269
this is a this is a very fancy syntax
okay so for a

594
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:31,279
okay so for a
 

595
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,030
okay so for a
v in d dot items and a is the number

596
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
v in d dot items and a is the number
 

597
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,069
v in d dot items and a is the number
yeah and now all the pr or k k is the

598
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
yeah and now all the pr or k k is the
 

599
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:38,790
yeah and now all the pr or k k is the
numbers

600
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
numbers
 

601
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,189
numbers
i wanted to check if k plus 1 is also in

602
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
i wanted to check if k plus 1 is also in
 

603
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,230
i wanted to check if k plus 1 is also in
d and i want to call that this v

604
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
d and i want to call that this v
 

605
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,110
d and i want to call that this v
counter v sum the v yeah this is

606
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
counter v sum the v yeah this is
 

607
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,990
counter v sum the v yeah this is
basically the same

608
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
basically the same
 

609
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,670
basically the same
as previously we we go we do this for

610
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680
as previously we we go we do this for
 

611
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,389
as previously we we go we do this for
k v in d dot items yeah

612
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
k v in d dot items yeah
 

613
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,750
k v in d dot items yeah
and then look it's the same as if

614
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
and then look it's the same as if
 

615
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,430
and then look it's the same as if
k plus one in d when we do this

616
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
k plus one in d when we do this
 

617
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,550
k plus one in d when we do this
answer plus equals what plus

618
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
answer plus equals what plus
 

619
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,710
answer plus equals what plus
equals v why yeah answer equals zero

620
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
equals v why yeah answer equals zero
 

621
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,829
equals v why yeah answer equals zero
so look this bit is the same as this bit

622
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839
so look this bit is the same as this bit
 

623
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,750
so look this bit is the same as this bit
okay yeah just a bit longer

624
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
okay yeah just a bit longer
 

625
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,590
okay yeah just a bit longer
yeah at least it's more fancier yeah you

626
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
yeah at least it's more fancier yeah you
 

627
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,430
yeah at least it's more fancier yeah you
want to some something

628
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
want to some something
 

629
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,550
want to some something
okay when you write more code you can

630
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
okay when you write more code you can
 

631
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,910
okay when you write more code you can
understand this a little bit but

632
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
understand this a little bit but
 

633
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,230
understand this a little bit but
it's not required at this moment the

634
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
it's not required at this moment the
 

635
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,069
it's not required at this moment the
most important thing is how how

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
so a bit challenging yeah okay so can
 

641
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,910
so a bit challenging yeah okay so can
you write it

642
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920

okay if i plus one in
 

701
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,509
okay if i plus one in
t answer plus equals one we're checking

702
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
t answer plus equals one we're checking
 

703
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,189
t answer plus equals one we're checking
the next number if it's in addition
