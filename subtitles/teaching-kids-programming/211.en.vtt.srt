00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:03,439
hello hello
 

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,190
hello hello
hello miss lorraine how are you today

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:05,200
hello miss lorraine how are you today
 

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,070
hello miss lorraine how are you today
good what did we talk about yesterday

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
good what did we talk about yesterday
 

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,549
good what did we talk about yesterday
oh we talked about the win we were

8
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:11,559
oh we talked about the win we were
 

9
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:14,390
oh we talked about the win we were
baptized we use our binary tree and we

10
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
baptized we use our binary tree and we
 

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:23,269
baptized we use our binary tree and we
use the questions

12
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279

 

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,310

yeah we we when we're exploring the

14
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,320
yeah we we when we're exploring the
 

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,509
yeah we we when we're exploring the
notes

16
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
notes
 

17
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,029
notes
in the next level yeah the notes are in

18
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
in the next level yeah the notes are in
 

19
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,069
in the next level yeah the notes are in
the queue

20
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
the queue
 

21
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,229
the queue
we is exploring all the notes in the

22
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
we is exploring all the notes in the
 

23
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,270
we is exploring all the notes in the
queue

24
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
queue
 

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,389
queue
as the next level we we can compute the

26
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
as the next level we we can compute the
 

27
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,150
as the next level we we can compute the
distance between the leftmost node and

28
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
distance between the leftmost node and
 

29
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,389
distance between the leftmost node and
rightmost now how do we compute the

30
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
rightmost now how do we compute the
 

31
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,950
rightmost now how do we compute the
distance if we go to the left node what

32
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
distance if we go to the left node what
 

33
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,670
distance if we go to the left node what
happens

34
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
happens
 

35
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,029
happens
we times two and to the right we time t

36
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
we times two and to the right we time t
 

37
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,310
we times two and to the right we time t
and plus one yeah so oh yeah we go to

38
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
and plus one yeah so oh yeah we go to
 

39
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,590
and plus one yeah so oh yeah we go to
the left we double it

40
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
the left we double it
 

41
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,990
the left we double it
we go to the right we add one double

42
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
we go to the right we add one double
 

43
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,869
we go to the right we add one double
edged one

44
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
edged one
 

45
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,910
edged one
good

46
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920

 

47
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,189

so today we're going to use the

48
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
so today we're going to use the
 

49
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,790
so today we're going to use the
different search okay definitely using

50
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
different search okay definitely using
 

51
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,070
different search okay definitely using
the stack

52
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
the stack
 

53
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,070
the stack
people search stack usually

54
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080

 

55
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,429

okay we're using that as usually

56
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439

 

57
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,870

so in order to do this surface search

58
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
so in order to do this surface search
 

59
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,670
so in order to do this surface search
we need to visit the nodes right within

60
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
we need to visit the nodes right within
 

61
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,149
we need to visit the nodes right within
a node

62
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
a node
 

63
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,149
a node
and when when we visit the nodes we need

64
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
and when when we visit the nodes we need
 

65
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,070
and when when we visit the nodes we need
to store the level

66
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
to store the level
 

67
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,270
to store the level
as the keys and the values the value

68
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
as the keys and the values the value
 

69
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,070
as the keys and the values the value
will be the v

70
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
will be the v
 

71
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,789
will be the v
and we update the v in the dictionary

72
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
and we update the v in the dictionary
 

73
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,510
and we update the v in the dictionary
right

74
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
right
 

75
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,550
right
so we have a data like data

76
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
so we have a data like data
 

77
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,670
so we have a data like data
the keys keys of the data will be

78
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
the keys keys of the data will be
 

79
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,149
the keys keys of the data will be
the level right and the values will be

80
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
the level right and the values will be
 

81
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,429
the level right and the values will be
a list of two values which has the

82
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
a list of two values which has the
 

83
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,069
a list of two values which has the
what the left and right okay and we keep

84
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
what the left and right okay and we keep
 

85
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,590
what the left and right okay and we keep
updating these two values

86
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
updating these two values
 

87
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,630
updating these two values
all right so can you tell me what

88
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
all right so can you tell me what
 

89
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,749
all right so can you tell me what
defines define let's do the define let's

implement define therefore search what

92
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
implement define therefore search what
 

93
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,310
implement define therefore search what
kind of parameters do we need

94
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
kind of parameters do we need
 

95
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,149
kind of parameters do we need
second minute what what kind of

96
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
second minute what what kind of
 

97
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,350
second minute what what kind of
parameters do we read

98
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360

 

99
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,110

when we go to the left tree

100
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
when we go to the left tree
 

101
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,710
when we go to the left tree
when we go to the left tree what

102
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
when we go to the left tree what
 

103
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,309
when we go to the left tree what
happened to the

104
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
happened to the
 

105
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,229
happened to the
times so if we go to the next tree

106
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
times so if we go to the next tree
 

107
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,710
times so if we go to the next tree
what what can what three values do i

108
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
what what can what three values do i
 

109
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,229
what what can what three values do i
need to give

110
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
need to give
 

111
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,390
need to give
if we go to the left lu will become one

112
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400

 

113
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,070

we go to the become one yeah and then v

114
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
we go to the become one yeah and then v
 

115
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,309
we go to the become one yeah and then v
will become one the v will be times

116
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
will become one the v will be times
 

117
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,350
will become one the v will be times
two yeah a level will become what that

118
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
two yeah a level will become what that
 

119
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,190
two yeah a level will become what that
will become

120
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
will become
 

121
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,589
will become
uh plus one plus one okay and we go to

122
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
uh plus one plus one okay and we go to
 

123
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,630
uh plus one plus one okay and we go to
the right do

124
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
the right do
 

125
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,670
the right do
do do one right

126
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
do do one right
 

127
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,309
do do one right
and what happened to the v v times t

128
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
and what happened to the v v times t
 

129
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,270
and what happened to the v v times t
plus one

130
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
plus one
 

131
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,509
plus one
and what happened to a level level plus

132
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
and what happened to a level level plus
 

133
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,270
and what happened to a level level plus
one where that

134
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
one where that
 

135
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,910
one where that
and then we know least then we can we

136
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
and then we know least then we can we
 

137
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,790
and then we know least then we can we
can say

138
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
can say
 

139
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,470
can say
if if the level if the first time

140
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
if if the level if the first time
 

141
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,830
if if the level if the first time
the if the key the level key is not

142
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:07,840
the if the key the level key is not
 

143
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,990
the if the key the level key is not
existent in the data dictionary what

144
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
existent in the data dictionary what
 

145
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,910
existent in the data dictionary what
happened what does it mean it means that

146
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
happened what does it mean it means that
 

147
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,869
happened what does it mean it means that
we all we visited the this note on the

148
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
we all we visited the this note on the
 

149
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,750
we all we visited the this note on the
first time on

150
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
first time on
 

151
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,180
first time on
this level then we

152
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,190

 

153
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,710

[Music]

154
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
[Music]
 

155
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,110
[Music]
how would we get to the same character

156
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
how would we get to the same character
 

157
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,390
how would we get to the same character
again

158
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
again
 

159
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,070
again
what do you think saying i is

160
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
what do you think saying i is
 

161
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,430
what do you think saying i is
not same note okay why do we need to go

162
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
not same note okay why do we need to go
 

163
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,110
not same note okay why do we need to go
back to the same note again

164
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
back to the same note again
 

165
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,430
back to the same note again
yeah no this is the one no at once

166
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
yeah no this is the one no at once
 

167
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,670
yeah no this is the one no at once
that's the definition

168
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
that's the definition
 

169
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,710
that's the definition
yeah okay so the first time

170
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
yeah okay so the first time
 

171
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,190
yeah okay so the first time
if the level is not in the in the data

172
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
if the level is not in the in the data
 

173
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,309
if the level is not in the in the data
what does it mean

174
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
what does it mean
 

175
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,470
what does it mean
we visit this the first time now we need

176
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
we visit this the first time now we need
 

177
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,670
we visit this the first time now we need
to set up key

178
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
to set up key
 

179
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,190
to set up key
data level equals what lr

180
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
data level equals what lr
 

181
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,229
data level equals what lr
equals vv okay

182
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
equals vv okay
 

183
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,429
equals vv okay
if if the lever is in

184
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
if if the lever is in
 

185
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,550
if if the lever is in
level in do uh in data level what does

186
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
level in do uh in data level what does
 

187
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,350
level in do uh in data level what does
it mean

188
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
it mean
 

189
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,149
it mean
we already seen the level before then we

190
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
we already seen the level before then we
 

191
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,270
we already seen the level before then we
need to update the level with the

192
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
need to update the level with the
 

193
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,949
need to update the level with the
compared to column v yeah right okay and

194
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
compared to column v yeah right okay and
 

195
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,310
compared to column v yeah right okay and
at the end at the end at the end this

196
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
at the end at the end at the end this
 

197
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,110
at the end at the end at the end this
data will

198
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
data will
 

199
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,949
data will
contain something like okay levels

200
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
contain something like okay levels
 

201
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,110
contain something like okay levels
yellow level zero

202
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
yellow level zero
 

203
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,270
yellow level zero
the left will be zero the light will be

204
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
the left will be zero the light will be
 

205
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,150
the left will be zero the light will be
zero level one the left will be maybe

206
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
zero level one the left will be maybe
 

207
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,030
zero level one the left will be maybe
glo y will be two right level two maybe

208
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
glo y will be two right level two maybe
 

209
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,150
glo y will be two right level two maybe
the left will be zero

210
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
the left will be zero
 

211
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,790
the left will be zero
right will be five so we want to

212
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
right will be five so we want to
 

213
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,150
right will be five so we want to
calculate

214
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
calculate
 

215
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,350
calculate
the maximum of this yeah y minus r

216
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
the maximum of this yeah y minus r
 

217
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,870
the maximum of this yeah y minus r
is if always go to the left because if

218
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
is if always go to the left because if
 

219
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,629
is if always go to the left because if
you put a zero here it goes to the left

220
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
you put a zero here it goes to the left
 

221
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,469
you put a zero here it goes to the left
it will be zero times two will be zero

222
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
it will be zero times two will be zero
 

223
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,990
it will be zero times two will be zero
right

224
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
right
 

225
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,909
right
oh yeah and then we want to find out

226
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
oh yeah and then we want to find out
 

227
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,070
oh yeah and then we want to find out
that maximum distance between

228
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
that maximum distance between
 

229
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,950
that maximum distance between
the values yeah so we can say return

230
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
the values yeah so we can say return
 

231
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,230
the values yeah so we can say return
next r

232
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
next r
 

233
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,590
next r
minus air plus one for l r in

yellow yeah okay
 

263
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,469
yellow yeah okay
okay listen like we have this data

264
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
okay listen like we have this data
 

265
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,550
okay listen like we have this data
as i said how do you define a dictionary

266
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
as i said how do you define a dictionary
 

267
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,909
as i said how do you define a dictionary
can you tell me how do you define the

268
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
can you tell me how do you define the
 

269
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,189
can you tell me how do you define the
teaching

270
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
teaching
 

271
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,390
teaching
decision right how do you differentiate

272
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
decision right how do you differentiate
 

273
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,629
decision right how do you differentiate
curly brace yeah or you can do this all

274
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
curly brace yeah or you can do this all
 

275
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,390
curly brace yeah or you can do this all
you can do

276
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
you can do
 

277
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,390
you can do
this this also works all d4

278
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
this this also works all d4
 

279
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,270
this this also works all d4
okay but the easiest way is to do this

280
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
okay but the easiest way is to do this
 

281
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,950
okay but the easiest way is to do this
curly brace it means that

282
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
curly brace it means that
 

283
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,350
curly brace it means that
it's addition what's this key value

284
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
it's addition what's this key value
 

285
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,390
it's addition what's this key value
pairs okay

286
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
pairs okay
 

287
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,749
pairs okay
key value pairs yeah like like theta

288
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
key value pairs yeah like like theta
 

289
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,230
key value pairs yeah like like theta
area equals eight theta ryan equals

290
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
area equals eight theta ryan equals
 

291
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,550
area equals eight theta ryan equals
seven okay we talked about this before

292
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
seven okay we talked about this before
 

293
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,150
seven okay we talked about this before
and then

294
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
and then
 

295
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,189
and then
what did define

296
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
what did define
 

297
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,749
what did define
therefore search what what's what's the

298
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
therefore search what what's what's the
 

299
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,189
therefore search what what's what's the
what's the parameters

300
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
what's the parameters
 

301
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,710
what's the parameters
how many parameters uh root value

302
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
how many parameters uh root value
 

303
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,830
how many parameters uh root value
and level

304
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
and level
 

305
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,110
and level
column okay if not root

306
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
column okay if not root
 

307
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,350
column okay if not root
if not no means that if rule is empty or

308
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
if not no means that if rule is empty or
 

309
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,029
if not no means that if rule is empty or
if you look

310
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
if you look
 

311
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,189
if you look
just return you is to leave empty when

312
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
just return you is to leave empty when
 

313
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,070
just return you is to leave empty when
we can

314
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
we can
 

315
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,350
we can
okay now we've got this level here

316
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
okay now we've got this level here
 

317
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,029
okay now we've got this level here
so if level as i said if level

318
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
so if level as i said if level
 

319
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,870
so if level as i said if level
in data what does it mean if we have

320
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
in data what does it mean if we have
 

321
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,670
in data what does it mean if we have
visited this before right

322
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
visited this before right
 

323
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,189
visited this before right
right then then what theta

324
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
right then then what theta
 

325
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,749
right then then what theta
the level right look this is the key

326
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
the level right look this is the key
 

327
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,830
the level right look this is the key
value

328
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
value
 

329
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,870
value
zero let's say yellow is the left

330
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
zero let's say yellow is the left
 

331
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,950
zero let's say yellow is the left
right one is the main uh the right okay

332
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
right one is the main uh the right okay
 

333
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,309
right one is the main uh the right okay
equals what the max zero zero

334
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
equals what the max zero zero
 

335
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,990
equals what the max zero zero
would be the left you could be mean

336
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,000
would be the left you could be mean
 

337

what happened to the liver plus one
 

399
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,070
what happened to the liver plus one
that was actually the right v times t

400
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
that was actually the right v times t
 

401
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,509
that was actually the right v times t
plus one level

402
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
plus one level
 

403
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,710

come on one lucky flavor the values are
two

446

two
 

447
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,430

and a list of two elements yeah the left

448
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440

the two lines above data level zero
 

481

the two lines above data level zero
equal what one
