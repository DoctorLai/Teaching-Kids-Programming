1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,399
hello

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,120
hello

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,440
hello mr eric are you right yeah

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,120
yeah yeah yeah okay so remember what's

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,559
the subsequence

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,559
this is something

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,279
okay this one

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,920
subsequent what's the substance remember

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,920
subsequent

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,880
all right

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,840
subsequent what's the difference between

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,840
subsequent and sub-list or sub-array

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,920
a

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,000
subsequent can pick live and

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,640
you can pick for some sequence you can

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,640
pick like two and three but for sublets

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,559
you only can play in continuous yeah

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,160
yeah yeah okay so you're right yeah sub

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,239
these and some are basically the same

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,480
thing yeah they continue you have to

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,399
prove us that we need o n square time

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,039
right remember we talked about is to

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,160
compute the number of the sub list for

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,120
given

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,719
yeah given given array we if there is

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,719
there are an element yeah if there are

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,600
an element of this array

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,720
and then we pick c and one yeah the sub

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,520
is with only one element plus c and two

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,640
pick two index right so that will become

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,680
n times n plus one divided by two okay

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,600
and to blue force it it takes o n square

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,600
time right

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,720
but the subsequence is different is the

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:25,520
original ray where i did it one or

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,119
or nothing or we did zero or nothing

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,360
or more than

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,520
more elements right so i can remove two

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,000
and the sub sub sequence would be one

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,640
two three if i remove five the steps can

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,479
become two one three okay

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,079
yeah

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,799
so today we're going to find out the

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,479
largest subsequent sum

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,560
largest

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,799
with largest k subsequent sum largest

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,840
k subsequent sum okay

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,320
so look if this k equals three so i want

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,399
to to find out the largest three

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,240
subsequent sum

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
okay size subsequent so you pick three

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,600
elements right

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
which has the largest sum can you pick

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
which the three animal which has the

55
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
largest sum the subsequence

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,319
5

57
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,480
3

58
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,200
yeah but 5 3 2 is not subsequent what's

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
the subsequence

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,120
you're right 2 5 3 2 is the largest

61
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,720
three sum but what's the subsequence

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,160
two five three two is not the

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,760
subsequence

64
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,840
exactly okay

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,680
yeah so two five three okay so

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,000
you have to do it that way

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,440
that's a good question if i'm if the

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,080
question becomes

69
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,560
if a question is that okay pick the k

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,640
largest sum right then you can sort this

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
away and then pick 532

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,599
easy yeah so if this is array you can

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,360
just do array dot sort

74
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,120
and then you can just return i want to

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
return this yeah return

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
return what

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,760
then the sum yeah the sum of it so i can

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,159
just return

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,239
all i return what are r

80
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,239
because the rate of source from the

81
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,239
smallest to the largest right so i can

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,280
do this minus k to the n right yeah

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,879
and that will

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,959
give you what

85
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,120
that will give you what

86
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,200
two three five right

87
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,480
yeah because when we sorted this array

88
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,560
you become

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,080
one two three five

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,319
and minus k minus three is at this point

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,959
i only look you're with me and two three

92
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,159
five or you can arrange the saw and you

93
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,640
pass that in parameter called reverse

94
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,760
reverse equals true

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,599
and array dot so that will become 5 3 2

96
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:43,120
1 right and then you pick the first k

97
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,599
first k so you can return a r r

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,200
up to k so it will return 5 three two

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,360
right

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,920
but this is not that simple right you

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,840
need to tell me the original subsequence

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,480
is two five three i don't want five

103
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,680
three two i don't want two three five

104
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,760
okay

105
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,360
yeah because in this case it'll be easy

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,319
what's the time constant recording the

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,760
song

108
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,239
uh oh and logan yeah okay

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,120
okay so the problem is that the strategy

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,680
of picking the largest cave

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,120
is your right yeah sort it picking the

112
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,919
largest but we want to be able to locate

113
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,520
the original index so we want to come up

114
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,639
with a solution to solve that numbers

115
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,040
while maintaining its index right so we

116
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,120
want to be able to say okay i want to

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,440
pick these three numbers but i also know

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,160
this index is

119
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,680
is what zero two three i want to pick

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,479
the numbers from the

121
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,160
smallest index to the biggest index okay

122
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,560
so

123
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,759
remember what kind of work function

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,560
of what function person do we return the

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,720
index and the value at the same time

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,720
remember we talked about a few days ago

127
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,000
pretend that you know the index and then

128
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,720
value remember

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,919
at the same time that's the total in

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
four

131
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,600
in star with e

132
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,880
enumerate yeah new line

133
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,960
so yeah

134
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,960
so we have this emulator that's fine so

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,440
let's let's do this okay and then you

136
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,479
can follow my lead so you can do it so

137
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,240
this is let's say this is numbers

138
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,880
these numbers

139
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,600
okay so then a a-r-r you tell me what it

140
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,440
is a-r equals list because e-numerator

141
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,880
is the iterator yeah i want to convert

142
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,440
it to a list enumerate

143
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,880
and then i have these nums so can you

144
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,840
tell me what it is

145
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,320
enumerate array so array

146
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,560
will be a array of

147
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,720
of what

148
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,880
that of what

149
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,280
eliminate what's the universe function

150
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,280
remember

151
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,560
test it returns the index and the value

152
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,440
right

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
yeah

154
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,840
okay so the index of two is what what's

155
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,000
the index of two

156
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,520
uh

157
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,520
index of two come on the first one

158
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,240
that's the value what's the index

159
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,120
yeah okay look yellow two that's a tuple

160
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,120
right and then one one right

161
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,360
and then two five and then can you tell

162
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,000
me the last one

163
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,560
zero one two and the last one is

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,680
three three yeah okay so that's what it

165
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,199
basically does enumerate has the index

166
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,120
and the value which is the tuple i

167
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,600
converted the list so that's the left so

168
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,440
i want to solve this number but i also i

169
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
want to sort it by the value like the

170
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,199
second key right so i can do this

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,039
already because this is the magic arr

172
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,800
the sort

173
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,800
right i want to sort it but i want to

174
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,960
give you the key because it's a tuple i

175
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,960
need to get a key key equals

176
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,880
yeah lambda is the short function x and

177
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,599
then i want to do this x one

178
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,000
right x is here x one is the value i

179
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:04,400
want to look basically this is to sort

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,560
this arr array by the second value right

181
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,240
by the second value but of course this i

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
want to maintain the index this is the

183
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,720
index right

184
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,039
yeah

185
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,080
okay so now i have these okay this is

186
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,080
the command okay so i have i'm sorting i

187
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,840
i can also sort it in the reverse order

188
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,080
which i put the

189
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,880
what put the

190
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,280
key equal uh reverse equals true right

191
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,039
now i want to get the index right

192
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,120
so index

193
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,880
equals i

194
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,599
right look

195
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,800
index what's the index

196
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:42,080
so look if i sort it and then no become

197
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,240
i i sort it by t so the ai will be

198
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,919
the value the first three values will be

199
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,960
one the first three

200
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,520
uh

201
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,039
so that will be one two five three right

202
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,800
one two five three

203
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,520
i know what one two five three so you'll

204
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,120
be

205
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,800
one one

206
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
two five

207
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,080
three three

208
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,599
uh actually now one three

209
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,319
one

210
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,280
one two yeah one zero zero two

211
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,879
one two the second variable and then

212
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,680
three three

213
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,319
and then two five right i want to solve

214
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,800
the second sort by the second value and

215
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,840
then this is the sorted so i want to get

216
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,319
the

217
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,919
last and last least the index will be

218
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:30,080
zero three two right so index so be i

219
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,919
for i comma j in a i

220
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,839
a r from

221
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,320
minus k to the n minus k to the n

222
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,039
so that the first index will be 0 3 so

223
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,440
index will be 0 3 2 right so now i need

224
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:49,360
to sort the index again right index.

225
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,360
yeah index dot sort will be

226
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,399
will return 0 to 3 right and then i need

227
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,399
to just return what return

228
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,080
i have the index and i want to use the

229
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,959
index to retrieve the value in the

230
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,080
number so i will say num

231
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,959
i

232
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,839
for

233
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,839
i

234
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,240
in

235
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,000
index all right

236
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,959
make sense

237
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,959
everything makes sense

238
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,920
okay so let me repeat okay you just

239
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,240
follow my lead first of all i call this

240
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,240
i ai equal list and i have this thing

241
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,240
the first element of the tuple is the

242
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,279
index the second element is the value

243
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,320
and i saw the array solely thing

244
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,279
by the first key equals x1 by this so

245
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,160
you tell me that the the sorted array

246
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,760
will be one one zero two three three two

247
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,279
five because i thought it the last value

248
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,519
yeah my last value

249
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,360
and then minus k two so i get these

250
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,959
three parts which is

251
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,640
two three five but i wanna index tier

252
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,160
three for two right this index will be

253
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,120
zero three 2 and after sorting it will

254
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,519
be 0 to 3 and then i go go through the

255
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,839
index to get the index to get kind of

256
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,000
index from the original number which is

257
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,959
0 to 3 so which is 0 to 3 0

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,160
2

259
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,720
three two five three

260
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,720
make sense

261
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,839
sorted

262
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,680
uh salty oh n sort it oven

263
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,560
again again

264
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,040
so two o and log in okay so the time the

265
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,399
complexities to oh and again but of

266
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,240
course this k

267
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,040
i need to i need to observe yeah we need

268
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,040
to assert this k thing as that k is

269
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,640
bigger than zero and smaller than the

270
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,399
length of the

271
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,200
smaller than or equal to length of

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,839
lambda okay we don't want to deal with

273
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,160
negative place or the k bigger than that

274
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,760
if k is a minion right

275
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,040
that doesn't make sense right yeah

276
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,800
okay so

277
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,880
this is one way

278
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,120
the second approach is that we can do

279
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,480
this using a

280
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,120
window sliding window a window thingy

281
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,440
so again is this the

282
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
okay let's consider a bigger

283
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,440
example okay

284
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,160
the numbers

285
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,880
equals 3 5

286
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,839
2

287
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,560
1

288
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,920
7 6 and k

289
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,600
equals three okay what's the largest

290
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,800
what's the k what's the

291
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,440
largest

292
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,959
subsequent which has three elements the

293
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,920
sum sum

294
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,920
uh it is

295
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,640
five

296
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,160
seven six yeah yeah you started the

297
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,480
number and then they picked the largest

298
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,279
the smallest one look this question is

299
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,760
easy for human right it's easy for us to

300
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,480
do it right all right we just slowly

301
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,000
pick the largest three numbers

302
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,600
which is six seven six five and then the

303
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,040
subsequence would be five seven six

304
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,200
easier it's very easy for us to

305
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,360
to find this solution but maybe a bit

306
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,680
tricky for computers to do it okay so

307
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,000
look k equals three let's let's maintain

308
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,399
a window of three so the the first

309
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,639
window of three is three five two right

310
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,480
this is a window window

311
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,560
three five two

312
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,279
okay and then now i am starting at this

313
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,320
number what's the minimum of these

314
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,399
two okay it's one bigger than two

315
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,440
no no then i i don't

316
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,519
we just skip it right because we if this

317
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,760
this is smaller than a minimum it means

318
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
that we come we can't we don't kick this

319
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,880
one right because

320
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,800
this one is more even smaller than the

321
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,200
minimum of it right

322
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,600
there's no no point to replace any of

323
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,959
element with this a smaller one right

324
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,519
seven

325
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,000
is it smaller is it bigger than that

326
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,240
yeah okay so what what do i do i do boo

327
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,040
i don't know the minimum

328
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,600
and i replace it with seven i append it

329
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,560
to the end right which is seven

330
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,560
okay six what's the minimum sorry i

331
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,560
remove it and i put it at the end

332
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,560
okay

333
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,600
five seven six

334
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,200
yeah

335
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,160
original

336
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,680
got it

337
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,839
yeah okay this is sliding it works why

338
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,079
because every time we cut the minimum of

339
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,800
this win right

340
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,440
and if this number is bigger than a

341
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,320
minimum so we can replace it yeah

342
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,720
right for a better solution i'm right

343
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,360
yeah that's a pretty solution now okay

344
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,880
so let's do this a little bit

345
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,680
and you you need to tell me what's the

346
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,760
time complexity think about it okay

347
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,639
define let's say

348
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,639
uh

349
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,519
largest

350
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,000
k

351
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,519
subsequent

352
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,320
then we have numbers we have a k

353
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,320
and obviously we need to assert this k

354
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,880
thing is bigger than zero smaller than

355
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,279
length of num

356
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,040
okay the window thing we know

357
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,680
window will be at the beginning will be

358
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,279
norms up to k right

359
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,160
and then for

360
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
i

361
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,120
in range

362
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,519
range what

363
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,800
which index we need to stop eric which

364
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,309
instead we need to start

365
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,309
[Music]

366
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,320
we already have the first window okay

367
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,600
yeah and up to lens end right

368
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,920
okay

369
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,040
and then look this is current minimum

370
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,399
equals we can say mean of the window

371
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,600
window

372
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,720
and then look

373
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,519
if nouns if current element

374
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,120
is bigger than the current mean right

375
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,040
there might be multiple solutions we

376
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,079
just written a new one look look if

377
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,320
these two

378
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,320
three

379
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,600
uh

380
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,519
h actually

381
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,079
okay

382
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,440
two three four

383
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,279
if they are duplicate anymore what

384
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,600
happened

385
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,440
so four four okay there's no duplication

386
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,440
if they duplicate element we need to put

387
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,199
the equal sign

388
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,760
should we select for the equals and

389
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,279
there if at least the pick the last two

390
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,760
is four four right

391
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,839
it's four four it's four four yes so if

392
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,839
it's bigger okay if it's bigger

393
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,399
if it's bigger than the smallest one

394
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,000
right if it's equal we don't replace it

395
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,760
because we we are not

396
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,839
we can't find a better solution it's

397
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,320
it's a easy it's the same services we

398
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,000
don't we don't we don't uh we don't

399
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,160
replace it and if it's bigger than the

400
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,920
current minimum then we do what we we

401
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,680
can do this window

402
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,760
don't remove remove the current element

403
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,480
current minimum we remove it and then we

404
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,440
need to append it to the end right a pen

405
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,079
all right what's it doing

406
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,320
apparently our eye yeah and then

407
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,360
at the end we do turn

408
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,360
return

409
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,199
okay

410
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,959
okay let's try with the duplicate

411
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:49,360
because i'm not quite sure let's do this

412
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,360
uh three two two three two

413
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,120
one and k equals

414
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,920
k equals two okay what's the k equals

415
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,920
two in this case

416
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,279
k first to keep the largest uh three two

417
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,600
two three or three two it doesn't matter

418
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,519
right you can tell me one okay so let's

419
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,920
say this window two three

420
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,519
okay two is smaller and it's bigger than

421
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,519
the minimum

422
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,519
yeah if it's bigger then we replace it

423
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,839
with three two okay it doesn't matter if

424
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,279
we put an equal we if we put the equal

425
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,360
that'll be three two if we don't play

426
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,920
equal it will be two three okay why is

427
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,440
that if it's equal look when we find the

428
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,440
second two eric

429
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,440
if it's equal then

430
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,279
if it's equal to the minimum we don't

431
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,639
move it and replace it apparently it

432
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,120
will become three two if we don't

433
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,639
replace it you become you will still be

434
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,639
two three okay what's the time down next

435
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,240
complexity

436
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,040
here is n

437
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,839
but

438
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,680
look finding the minimum here

439
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,920
finding the minimum this window is k

440
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,920
right o n times k

441
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,560
and

442
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,160
remove it remove one anymore look okay

443
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,680
list

444
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,440
let me let me do this all right come on

445
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,120
a r r

446
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,760
one two three four and then a r r dot

447
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,959
remove this operation remove two for

448
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,039
example yeah

449
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,319
remove two then a out become one three

450
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,959
four yeah easy yeah but if i remove

451
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,039
now is this element here if i remove -2

452
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,000
then the computer will screen

453
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,120
because this minus 2 is not in the list

454
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,880
yeah

455
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,640
makes what do i just say

456
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,480
if you do like

457
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,799
negative number

458
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,400
it will scream

459
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,799
it's not because it's negative because

460
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,720
it's this is not in here right

461
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,000
okay okay okay so what's the time time

462
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,679
relaxed to remove this it's o n okay so

463
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,880
this is o n as well

464
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,679
uh

465
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,919
o n but this is k because look

466
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,280
this window is k size yeah this thick

467
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,200
side

468
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,880
okay it's a thick side

469
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,080
but every time i remove it i have plenty

470
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,160
of one so it's always k as fixed size so

471
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,240
this is still one as well so all

472
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,200
together is one all right

473
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,300
o n

474
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,559
okay so all together

475
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,760
[Music]

476
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,919
o and k

477
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,080
which which is p which is bigger oh and

478
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,280
log n and o and k

479
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,080
what do you think which one is bigger

480
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,080
it depends

481
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,480
that's a

482
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,240
good question that's a good point but if

483
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,559
you think about it

484
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,480
if you think about it

485
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,480
yeah because if you look at it

486
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,400
k and log n you're not sure which one is

487
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,960
bigger that's a very good first point

488
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,360
but in this case is k smaller or bigger

489
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,360
than n

490
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,760
smaller where if it's smaller okay let's

491
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,760
say if it's at most it's n okay so if

492
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,240
it's m n let's say

493
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,160
o n okay o n square

494
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,480
o n square no learn k which one is

495
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
bigger

496
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,600
and square and oh

497
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,240
yeah of course yeah because we know

498
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,160
k is smaller or equal than n right

499
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,840
yeah so let's say okay in worst case

500
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,240
it's n right

501
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,919
but in worst case it's ending if it's n

502
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,640
we don't actually we don't need to

503
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,120
continue here right because look if

504
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,480
given this side the largest case is it's

505
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,360
excel right

506
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,640
yeah

507
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,200
yeah okay so if it's worst case is one

508
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,960
and obviously this is better okay

509
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,919
this is better

510
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
right

511
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,840
if we can if we don't consider about

512
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,200
last thing we're just considering

513
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,080
these two things and k is smaller than n

514
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,760
and

515
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,840
o and k

516
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,520
o n

517
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,559
k is

518
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,320
is the o and log n is better than okay

519
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,520
right but actually if it's if k so look

520
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,280
k k is for for example is roughly n

521
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,440
divided by two

522
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,520
right if n divided by two

523
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,440
i don't know we we can put a let's say

524
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,360
we can put a hundred there right a

525
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,600
hundred a hundred

526
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:09,520
divide n is a hundred k will be fifty

527
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,039
o log 100 yeah still better than k

528
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,080
equals 60 okay

529
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:17,200
so yeah clearly this is the winner okay

530
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,600
yeah any questions so far

531
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,840
okay say bye to people

532
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,840
bye bye
