1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
hello mr mr rhino right

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,040
what's this

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,679
square oh yeah square oh what's this

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,040
data structure

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,240
cycle

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,519
yeah so what kind of thing we are

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,519
talking about when we talk about cycles

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,800
the thing i'm looking for here okay wow

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,199
okay so look

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,640
imagine this is the bus stop right zero

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,359
therefore bus stop and then there are

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,840
cycles yeah the bus stop so the

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,160
distance between zero and one the vertex

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,000
here in the graph is one and one to two

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,079
is two two two three three three two

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,719
four is uh three to zero

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,719
undirected weighted class and directly

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,719
radical

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,039
wait wait it means that

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,800
the edge is between the vertex that

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,680
is noted right

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,640
here

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,640
okay so if we given a start and stop

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,160
right for example like we're given a

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,120
star and

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,119
here

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,720
and a stop and here we're given only two

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,960
vertex here so we want to find out the

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,799
shortest distance between them so what's

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,880
the shortest distance between perfect

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,640
zero and vertex one if you look at this

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,400
graph yeah if you're looking at let's go

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,119
ahead and this one

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,360
one one okay if i put this eight what's

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,119
the self-existence between

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,720
maybe not eighteen okay what's the

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,520
celtics this one between zero two and

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,920
one that can be that's impossible why

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,880
because they would they have the same

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,240
length

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,000
but they have different lengths but yeah

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,479
i know fuck it up at least it's weighted

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,880
yeah at the bottom it's three but at the

44
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,880
top is

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,640
we're not actually looking at the length

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,479
that's why we say weighted what's the

47
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,799
shortest system between zero and one or

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,799
one two two nine how do you get that

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
yeah so basically how many choices can

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,880
we get

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,799
travel between two stops in this

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,719
particular and weighted direction i'm

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,479
waiting wait

54
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,720
yeah yeah in this square and direct

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,879
weight graph remember we we have list

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,560
here too yeah so we want to find the

57
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,480
minimum of it we are given uh undirected

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,200
right both way and directly means both

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,400
ways weighted graph means the

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,720
cost between the edges are different

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,360
right if it's a weight and weighted it

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,080
means the cost between the edges are all

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,480
the same we can think of it as

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,760
one or equal yeah

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,040
okay so

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,560
if an aggregate can be used on a

67
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,800
directed

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,080
graph then it can also be used in the

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,040
undirected one am right yeah if a

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,360
aggregate can be used on a weighty graph

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,519
then it can also be used on the iota

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,599
graph this is a simple question we can

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,360
just like uh compare the minimum two

74
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,760
parts to make sure the first index

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,319
always comes before the second index we

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,840
can compute the distance of these and

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,480
then the distance of that and we could

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
get a minimum define the shortest

79
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,760
distance

80
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,519
in the graph right in the graph we given

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,200
this the distance and then we have

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,280
released the star

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,599
and we have a stop

84
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,920
so the star

85
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,159
star may come after stop in the ground

86
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,640
right the star maybe comes after the

87
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,920
stop so in the in the case we can swap

88
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,840
it so if star is bigger than stop

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,480
then we swap it how do we swap two

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,040
variables a and b how do we swap a and b

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,040
here

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,519
a b equals one b

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,200
easy only in python you can do this but

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,159
if it's other problem in language we

95
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,159
need to use that another variable

96
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,480
another variable to do it so for the t

97
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,200
equals a a equals b

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,280
b equals b right

99
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
yeah

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,360
we need to

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,000
to make a copy of the value of a and

102
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,000
before i assign a new value b

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,640
right and then this this is to restore

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,640
the value original value of a so this is

105
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,120
the traditional way of changing two

106
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,879
variables using the third variable

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,000
if start you can stop then start stop

108
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,079
uh equals stop star okay we're just uh

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,959
changing these two variables so after

110
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,680
this

111
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,199
so the star is always smaller than stop

112
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,600
okay now we want to calculate the

113
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,479
distance here this distance

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,720
d1 equals

115
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,440
sum we're using the sum right

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,240
some distance of uh star

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,240
up to stop

118
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,160
this is this thing how do we calculate

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,000
this this bit

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,960
how do you get this bit come on there

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,600
are two ways of doing it this bit is d y

122
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,639
which is calculated d1 equals sum b star

123
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,160
to stop what's the distance of this bit

124
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,759
how to get that

125
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,880
two way there are two ways of doing

126
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,960
adding

127
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,199
adding yeah we can add it or we can do

128
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,039
this subtraction yeah we know if we know

129
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,840
this all together if we say d

130
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,440
d

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,919
zero equals sum of everything d

132
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,160
right so this is every chord then with d

133
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,800
two would be t 0 minus b 1 right right

134
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,600
the total cost is 18 plus 2 plus 3 plus

135
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,160
4 minus 18 and of course will be the

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,240
other part the cost the distance between

137
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,199
other times so we just return the

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,800
minimum

139
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,880
minimum of

140
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,720
d1

141
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,800
and then d2 here this is star

142
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,240
and this is stop

143
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,000
another way will be

144
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,520
calculate this bit

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,880
this bit plus this bit okay so

146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,160
so this d2 can also be written as

147
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,360
sum

148
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,720
of the

149
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
d up to star

150
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,479
plus sum b

151
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,880
stop

152
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,919
to the end right

153
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,960
one way

154
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,919
we know this t1 yeah d1 is start to stop

155
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,840
here

156
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,520
so one way is to to do this

157
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,080
subtraction the other way is calculate

158
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,319
the distance between the star and the

159
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,199
distance after the stop because these

160
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
two

161
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,400
these two

162
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,880
runs up a circle right look at this

163
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,520
these two wrong double center

164
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,360
yeah

165
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,240
one last question what's the problem and

166
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
what have you learned today

167
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,600
what what do we have here what do we

168
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,520
have here this is bus stop mr bus stop

169
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,919
and what do we have

170
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,400
we have

171
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,720
a graph we have got what kind of graph

172
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
is it

173
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,120
i directly weighted one we want to

174
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,199
calculate the shortest distance and

175
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,759
there's only two possibilities this is a

176
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,599
very simple graph it's a regular graph

177
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,120
uh okay so we let's talk about the

178
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,039
concept the graphical graph regular

179
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,960
graph is that any vertex in the graph

180
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,440
has the same number of neighbors for

181
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,440
example each vertex in the in

182
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,000
has a same number of vertex right the

183
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,160
number of same number of neighbors this

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
is the squad which has a cycle it's a

185
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,720
regular graph it's a connected graph

186
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,199
right all of uh neighbors can be visited

187
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,280
by any all the vertex can be visited by

188
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,000
any vertex right and then it's a

189
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,919
indirectly it's a wavy graph and then we

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,400
only have two possibilities we just

191
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,440
iterate we just pull for 6 right the

192
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,599
time complexity is o and if n vertex

193
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,080
right because we want to calculate the

194
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,919
distance the sum of the distance between

195
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,280
a newton's stop okay that's it for today

196
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,280
bye bye

197
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,280
bye
