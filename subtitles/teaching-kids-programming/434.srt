1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,160
okay so yesterday we talked about the uh

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,719
the subset one two three and one

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,200
how many subsets of that

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,359
eight yeah eight because there are n

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,480
numbers 10 unique numbers so we have

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,320
total

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,039
2 to the power of n

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,119
for why is that that's very easy to

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,680
think of here yeah but for each number

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,000
we have two choice we include we will

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,399
pick this number in a subset or we don't

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
pick it so now we can choice and then n

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,760
of it so it's 2 times 2 times 2 here 2

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,160
to the power 2 times negative 2 that

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,120
will be n 2 so that's 2 to the power of

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,239
n ok

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,120
so we use this backtracking so for each

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,580
one

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,840
uh define

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,960
[Music]

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,280
the fs we have this current set

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,360
conversation and then we are looking at

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,160
ice numbers so if we literally n

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,199
n is the numbers of the

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,920
original unique numbers and then we want

26
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,400
to put all the subsets into this list

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,760
and the list and if i equals m we reach

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,000
the end and we answer the append

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,600
a pen we append a copy of the current

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,560
set so

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,119
yeah these symbol means the copy so we

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,759
all we can also do this copy copy here

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,200
right and then we can

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,600
otherwise we have two choice which is

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,040
if we don't pick it we move to the next

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,200
number or if we pick it we include it in

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,520
the current subset which is nums i yeah

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,040
and then we move to the next number and

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,119
then dfs start with entities the first

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,399
number return

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,320
answer yeah easy okay

42
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,320
okay so today we're going to solve this

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
problem slightly different okay so by

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,040
looking look this is a very good good

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,439
thing is that we know the number of uh

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,759
subset total is 2 to the power of n okay

47
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,799
so let's find let's look at this number

48
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,640
yeah look zero to the three numbers from

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,679
zero to seven

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,200
so zero in binary is let's just look at

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,680
three digits okay because that's three

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,319
numbers zero zero zero

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,239
one is zero zero one

54
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,360
two is zero one zero three is zero one

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
one okay can you tell me four what's

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,080
four

57
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,480
five six seven okay so can you tell me

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,720
the binary for this number four is i

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,640
give i start first one zero zero okay

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,160
five

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,400
what's five

62
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,400
uh

63
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,780
[Music]

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,959
yeah you see always it's like uh

65
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,879
you know this is the the significant bit

66
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,640
at least it's the most significant bit

67
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,959
so look from the right hand side we call

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
it asb from the left hand side we call

69
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,360
it msb

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,760
yeah most significant bit okay

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,760
so each bit this is 2 to the power of 0

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,680
2 to the power of 1 2 to the power 2.

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,080
okay so that's the most interesting part

74
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,319
here okay if it is 0 0

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,440
the the subset is

76
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,120
empty this if it's 1 1 1 is one two

77
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,599
three okay

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,879
okay and then zero zero one

79
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,159
zero zero one let's it's one

80
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,959
okay zero one zero is two

81
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,280
okay

82
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,519
zero one one is one two

83
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,000
and then this is three

84
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,080
this is one three

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
okay so can you tell me one one zero

86
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,480
what's this what does that correspond to

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,560
i give you the most look

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,560
one one zero

89
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,799
anybody right

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,840
one one zero what does it give us

91
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,319
two three totally wired

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,660
okay so can you tell me why oh yeah can

93
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,760
you tell me

94
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,959
[Music]

95
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,959
and this is one and

96
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,720
there are three digits so that's a good

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,120
thing three digits in the number three

98
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,400
right so if it is yellow we don't pick

99
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,000
it if it's one we pick it easy right so

100
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,160
look look at this

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,680
one one zero zero we pick the three we

102
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,720
don't pick the seals

103
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,600
first uh and one and two so no desire

104
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,320
easy

105
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,320
so we can just we can just iterate over

106
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,680
this number and then by checking each

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,840
bit

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,240
okay by checking each people just

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,960
we just need to check if each bit is set

110
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,199
if it's set then we pick it in a subset

111
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,800
if not then we skip it okay

112
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,800
and that will be

113
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,639
okay i'm going to keep this but i'm

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,280
going to rewrite this bit okay so this

115
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,720
is called kind called uh

116
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,120
big masking

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,120
quick masking fit

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,120
masking

119
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,840
each bit zero or one

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,400
masking what mask

121
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,800
you put a mask yeah masking so every

122
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,080
time i look at one number and one bit to

123
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,280
see if it's zero or one okay so

124
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,360
define

125
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,520
the subset

126
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,039
these numbers i'm going to write it okay

127
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,400
it could be shorter right so the answer

128
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,560
and this is

129
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,680
n equals the length of numbers yeah

130
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,440
we assume all the numbers in the subset

131
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,960
are unique okay

132
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,919
four

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,440
i

134
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,919
in range n right so we're good no not

135
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,520
range and range two to the power of n

136
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,680
right two to the power and we can say

137
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,039
power to n of

138
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,720
1

139
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,080
60 and position okay so okay so here is

140
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
the thing

141
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,680
power

142
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,800
2 to the power of n this is 2 to the

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,199
power n

144
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,960
one shift is shifting n this is the same

145
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,000
thing is two to the power and why is

146
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,520
that look

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,560
two to the power of

148
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,000
three

149
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,520
is eight yeah

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,680
this is power

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
two to the power three and then one

152
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,600
shift is fifty three what does it mean

153
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,759
look i have one here

154
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,479
i sift in one position to the left i put

155
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,960
a zero in binary i shifted another

156
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,960
position to the left i put another zero

157
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,000
i shifted another one

158
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,600
okay

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,840
three zero and yeah what's this in

160
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
binary

161
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,600
what's this in binary come on

162
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,400
yeah it's there okay hey exactly because

163
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
this is one

164
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,600
two

165
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,600
four eight okay

166
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,039
so this is the same thing okay so this

167
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,560
is the same thing as

168
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,039
s power two to the power and four

169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,280
power using the mass power two n okay

170
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,680
this is the same thing now we go through

171
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,800
this i now we need to go through these

172
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,599
this numbers yeah so for

173
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,319
j

174
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,800
in range we want to go through we want

175
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,039
to check each element to see if it's one

176
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
or zero so in range

177
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,479
n

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,880
right so then we need to check if

179
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,199
i okay so this is the binary this is the

180
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,039
one i want to check check these this

181
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,919
number so j

182
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,759
and

183
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,440
okay this is finally

184
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,280
one

185
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,800
shifty shifty j

186
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,599
then i put this current

187
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,599
dot append

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,560
nums j okay

189
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,400
i'm going to tell you why okay these

190
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,319
carbons equal

191
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,960
each neuron

192
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,560
the current current is empty list and if

193
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,080
this speed is set we include that

194
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,160
that number

195
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,560
in the current set and an answer for

196
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,879
each one we have a new subset

197
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,680
a pen

198
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,680
current okay

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,840
and then we can answer here that will be

200
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,879
written answer

201
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,879
okay so

202
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,080
so this is the most difficult part to

203
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,199
understand what's this mean okay this i

204
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,160
and

205
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,639
i

206
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,680
i is this number yeah i

207
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,240
i is this number this binary so j for

208
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,160
example the second one the second one

209
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,840
the bit is represent is one shifty 50

210
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,160
one which is

211
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,039
which is one zero in binary zero one

212
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,280
zero the the third bit

213
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,319
third bit is

214
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,919
zero one zero zero okay so basically one

215
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:32,159
shift j j is the index so for third for

216
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:35,760
the third number is 1 50

217
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,640
j which is two zero one two okay two so

218
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,399
this is two to the power of

219
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,839
what 2 to the power of

220
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,240
2 to the power of

221
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,160
how many 2 to the power of 0 2 to the

222
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,120
power 1 2 to the power 2

223
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,920
2 to the power of 2 equals 4 so the

224
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,440
bit the big masking for the third digit

225
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,800
is 1 0 0 right so if any of these

226
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,279
numbers

227
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,080
end to the n operation

228
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,080
and operation by this number if we give

229
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,440
it smaller than 0 then we need to

230
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,839
include this number this is the same

231
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
thing what's

232
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,440
n and

233
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,160
and then we talk about this n in in if

234
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,920
statement yeah if eric is a good boy and

235
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,279
ryan is a good boy

236
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,959
i give you

237
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,880
both

238
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,880
uh ultraviolet pens uh

239
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,800
yeah

240
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,399
or if eric is a good boy or ryan is a

241
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,800
good boy

242
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,760
and i will give you

243
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,959
both

244
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,399
uh a pop right so all is that at least

245
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,040
one of it and is that both needs to be

246
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,320
true right so in binary it's the same

247
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,720
thing one

248
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,000
and one is one one and zero is what

249
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,959
cl n

250
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,959
zero zero and one is zero

251
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,279
zero and one is zero one and zero is

252
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,440
zero zero and zero

253
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,480
is zero okay so this is the same thing

254
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,760
as the if right so

255
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,320
it will be one only if both sides are

256
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,240
one if one of them is one it's not

257
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,920
enough okay so this is the same thing

258
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,480
okay and and

259
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,480
then the n

260
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,920
okay so look at this term complexity

261
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,600
this is o to 2 to the power of n

262
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,240
and for each one we need to iterate

263
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,519
anytime so some complexity is

264
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,519
o

265
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,240
n times

266
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,040
2 to the power of n okay right because

267
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,519
look

268
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,720
this iterate the inner loop literally

269
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,880
and time the outer loop it raised

270
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,680
two to the n times right

271
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
antenna

272
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,640
and

273
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,959
and iterate uh success okay

274
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,800
yeah okay that's it for today good job

275
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,040
bye bye

276
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,040
bye bye
