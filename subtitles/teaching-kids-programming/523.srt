1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
finally yeah we talk about binary in

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,820
computer we use the binary binary zero

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,019
and one Community is powered by

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,900
electricity

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,299
so we power on WE power off the two

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,520
states the electricity the high voltage

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,720
low voltage there are two states so it's

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,699
zero one yeah

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,519
so

10
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:29,939
the numbers in binary only have two

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,099
digits zero and one we talk about the

12
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,100
binary okay let's look at the first few

13
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,840
numbers the zero one two three this is

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,020
the decimal the numbers we're using

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,480
today right decimal so can you tell me

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,420
what the corresponding binary this is

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,739
decimal this is binary I give you a few

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,219
examples okay

19
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,700
zero one what's two one zero zero and

20
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,700
then what's next

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,179
[Music]

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,320
um one zero zero zero

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,320
one zero zero one

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,560
um one zero one zero one zero one zero

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,220
oh is that the one again one zero one

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,820
one

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:25,020
one one

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:27,840
zero there one one zero one one one one

29
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,640
one one okay so look at these start from

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,180
this one okay this is two to the power

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,920
zero this is two to the power one this

32
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,860
is two to the power of two

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,140
this is two to the power of three

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,259
uh and then we have one more six things

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,000
one zero zero zero zero okay two to the

36
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,640
power four okay so can you tell me the

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,119
common things about this uh Power of

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,119
tools

39
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,520
so what have you learned from this

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,100
um well uh

41
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,819
and the

42
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,840
Power of Two is the amount of zebras

43
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,200
they have

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,720
so it's one one followed by you know the

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,660
number of powers zeros after it all

46
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,420
right yeah okay so this is binary okay

47
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,819
we already talked about how to convert

48
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,520
between binary and decimal in the past

49
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,860
okay okay so today's question uh this

50
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,920
binary is related to this value so the

51
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,620
first few integers one two three four

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,480
five six so let's look at these numbers

53
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,379
integers so one is one two is one zero

54
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,980
three

55
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,319
is one one right look

56
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,319
and first of all

57
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,660
we convert the integer to binaries and

58
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,760
then we put it together yeah we we put

59
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,879
this together in binary form so that

60
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,000
these we want to get the value of this

61
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,580
so what's this in binary one one zero

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,370
one one how do we convert a binary to a

63
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,300
decimal

64
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,400
[Music]

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,739
that's right yes we'll count it yes how

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,819
do we count it look this one yeah this

67
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,959
is one

68
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,340
this is two each one is doubles for

69
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,480
a

70
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,280
16 yeah so this number is like 1 16 plus

71
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,459
a plus

72
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,720
we skip four right because this is zero

73
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,760
one two plus one so this is 27.

74
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,400
all right

75
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,659
so any idea I mean we're given an

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,120
integer n

77
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:42,840
for example if you get n equals four and

78
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,379
we need to get this 4 is one zero zero

79
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,500
so we put this binary together so we're

80
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,160
going to get the value of this in

81
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,480
decimal

82
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,819
[Music]

83
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,739
so what's your thoughts I mean you don't

84
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,940
have to dig into details just tell me

85
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,940
how just all this problem

86
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,659
Rufus is a good idea yeah so look we

87
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,840
know how to

88
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,239
how to convert this uh from numbers to

89
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,760
Binary right and then we put it together

90
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,340
and then we convert it back all right

91
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,799
let's restart okay so we can do this

92
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,320
first first of all we need to get the

93
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,560
binaries for the numbers and how do we

94
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,720
get a binary numbers we talk about uh

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,680
the egg right but in Python we have this

96
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,820
pin function remember the PIN three zero

97
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,380
B one one okay look pin 15.

98
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,500
give us

99
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,320
zero B one one one one so low is prefix

100
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,479
with zero P which is binary okay so if

101
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,280
this number is n array first of all

102
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,540
array equals

103
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,500
ping

104
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,540
I and we want to remove the prefix we

105
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,060
start with the

106
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,280
third character onwards so it's two to

107
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,460
the end

108
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,880
for I in range

109
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,139
1 to n plus one right so it's one to n

110
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,680
inclusive

111
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:10,440
and now we have this AR which is a r now

112
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,300
equals one

113
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,380
one zero

114
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,840
one one

115
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,240
Etc right so we want to

116
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,240
put these numbers together from another

117
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,280
way what function can we use

118
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,060
to put all the things together using

119
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,240
this sorry join okay join by empty space

120
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,580
join yes we're done John AI so once we

121
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,039
join it now we want to convert it back

122
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,560
to integer right yeah so this is

123
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,320
function look so we just do this end

124
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,660
and then the second parameter base two

125
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,759
which is finally and that's it all right

126
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,900
so you can even do this in one line so

127
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,259
return

128
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,880
into this this ARR yeah I think it's

129
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,360
here okay

130
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,060
pin two yeah the time the next day

131
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,699
I end up here and look for each one we

132
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,100
need to convert it to Binary right let's

133
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:05,039
login to this so it's the time commence

134
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,220
is o n Times login any question on this

135
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,220
one

136
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,160
okay look at this three number so let's

137
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,380
look at it one so what happens if we

138
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,660
move to the next integer it's two right

139
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,580
it's one zero right so we put a one zero

140
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,280
what happened to this one

141
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,259
it moves two space to the left all right

142
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,360
when you move one space to the left

143
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,060
whatever when you put a zero at the end

144
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,500
will happen if you don't

145
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,500
you put a zero at the end will happen

146
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,440
this is one

147
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,180
you put a zero What's this

148
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,180
you put another zero what happened

149
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,180
foreign

150
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,740
I need to move two space to the left so

151
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,720
I move two space to the left so what

152
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,660
happened to this one two to the power of

153
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,419
two right look another one so this is

154
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,880
one one zero so okay another one let's

155
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:11,460
look at this one one so what happened I

156
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,960
put a one one here what happened

157
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,220
so this number

158
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,440
move two space to the left right

159
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,819
so every time you move the one space to

160
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,220
the left it doubles

161
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:26,220
move to Space 2 to the power two we can

162
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,620
just scan these numbers and then we get

163
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,300
the length if we know the length we know

164
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,560
how much we need to multiply how many

165
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,240
space we need to move the current

166
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,800
integer to the left

167
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,380
four

168
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,819
okay this is answer right answer at the

169
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:45,060
beginning equals zero for I in range

170
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:48,599
1 to n plus one right

171
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:52,800
so now look I we want to convert I to

172
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:57,180
Binary right so let's finally P equals

173
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,220
pin I will talk about this right bin I

174
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,940
why are we converting these the numbers

175
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,940
to binary

176
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:09,240
yeah one these two two converted final

177
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:12,120
is one zero so then we know one needs to

178
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,520
move two space to the left so you know

179
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,400
what the numbers to put

180
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,860
yeah numbers to put here we can just

181
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,500
simply add the numbers I here but the

182
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,539
most important thing is this one needs

183
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,699
to move two space to the left

184
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,960
so why do we need to convert the numbers

185
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,479
to binary

186
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,159
because we want to find out how many

187
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,459
what's left

188
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,620
spaces what spaces the length right

189
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:40,680
because we want to find out the dance

190
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,380
look four is one zero zero we convert it

191
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,020
to Ping this is the length now we need

192
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,940
to do this lens get the lens we need to

193
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:55,260
subtract two why do we need to subtract

194
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:57,600
two this pin 4 pairs US 0p 1 0 0 so why

195
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,820
do we need to subtract two the lens of

196
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,100
being this is the size of this is one

197
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,240
two three four five but we need to

198
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,160
subtract two

199
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,920
because

200
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,899
what's this we don't need this right the

201
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,480
binary is in this one huh

202
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,279
yeah we just need a lens of this right

203
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,940
so subscribe to and then we have recipe

204
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:20,160
what happened answer need to move the

205
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,320
space shift shift

206
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,620
be partition to the left

207
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:30,300
and then answer plus equal I all right

208
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:32,519
so look one moved one move two space to

209
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,220
the left for the two zeros at the end b

210
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,500
equals two right move two space to the

211
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,860
left and then plus I

212
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,380
eyes here one zero plus idea right so

213
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,720
it's one one zero here got it

214
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,640
and then return answer the time

215
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,860
complexity is still o n okay because

216
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,800
look this pin from here this pin

217
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,519
function is taking time we just want to

218
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,860
get the length of the binary right do we

219
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,899
need to check it for each number look

220
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,000
the length of these look what happened

221
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,740
uh let me write it this way look at this

222
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,480
one just just look at this think about

223
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:14,880
it I'm going to write a binary here

224
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:17,339
right 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1

225
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,620
1 0 0 okay enough look at this pattern

226
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,360
yeah look at this pattern this is binary

227
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,180
I'm going to convert it to a string and

228
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,980
then get the lens the lens one one two

229
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,720
two three three three three four okay so

230
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,860
do you see the pattern when does the

231
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,860
size increase by one

232
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:39,959
one one one one what's next one zero

233
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,660
zero zero zero now this is sizes for

234
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:45,839
this size is five so in what cases the

235
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:52,279
integer the length increment by one

236
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:52,279
when is one one is what when it's one

237
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,079
one is all one it's not increasing look

238
00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:00,660
one one uh one zero it's not increasing

239
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,000
it's therefore but one is

240
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,180
so what happened

241
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,740
it turns to one zero zero okay so one

242
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,019
two two

243
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,500
yeah two to three

244
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:16,019
three to four four to five this is the

245
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,740
number I when I

246
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:24,540
is what then we can increment the length

247
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,940
when I is is one and ends with zero so

248
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,040
what's n with zero so what's this what's

249
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,420
this number yes

250
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,000
it's

251
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:38,040
in binary one followed by lots of zeros

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,380
what's this number is 2 4 8. power of

253
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,959
two exactly okay in binary because look

254
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,660
in final we just talk about binary one

255
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,000
followed by lots of zeros how many zero

256
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,760
and zero here right so what's this

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,220
number two to the power of n right this

258
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,140
is power two we don't need this now in

259
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,700
this case we don't need this right so

260
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,920
what do we need to do we give up the

261
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,800
current length current length equals

262
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,680
zero and we don't need this all right

263
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,720
this is current uh let's let's just put

264
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,620
a b equals zero okay

265
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:14,640
okay then we'll just do this if I is

266
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:17,220
power of two right I is Power of Two

267
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,160
I is power two okay we are coming back

268
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,760
to this power of two then we increment

269
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,640
the length B plus equal one all right

270
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,140
so how do we check if number if the

271
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,640
integer is power to the last question

272
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,920
how do we check if the integer is

273
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,220
powerful how do we know 32 is powerful

274
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,640
how to know 64 is equal to

275
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,200
and then he'll eventually

276
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,820
become

277
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,339
zero sorry

278
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,380
how do how do we check if the number is

279
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,940
power of two there are quite a few ways

280
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,220
last time you talk about you know

281
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,260
multiplier two every time right all

282
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,120
right all all divided by two that's one

283
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,760
way is it definitely

284
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,440
yeah yeah yeah lock-in solution but what

285
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,540
I'm saying that look look at the binary

286
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,760
yeah you just tell me that it's one five

287
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,240
followed by loss of zero right look at

288
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,240
this okay

289
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:11,940
if we subtract one to this what happened

290
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,100
one followed by lots of zeros if you

291
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,100
subtract one what happened subtract one

292
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,440
to this what happened one of the digits

293
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,560
is gone and

294
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,720
we're done okay then how about if I do

295
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,120
this end you know logic n both things

296
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,079
are true then it's true so if you do the

297
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:35,339
n what happened what's the number here

298
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:38,279
two n a and b a needs to be one B needs

299
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:40,980
to P1 otherwise it's all false so zero

300
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,500
and one is four so that will become zero

301
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:48,360
right if

302
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:50,820
I am I minus 1 is equal to zero of

303
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,040
course I is to bigger than zero right

304
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,800
right because I is bigger than zero so

305
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,560
we can ignore this so we can just say if

306
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,779
I and I minus y equals zero is a power

307
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,079
of two then B plus equal one and then

308
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:07,139
that's it and because this N is a one

309
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,880
constant so the time complexity is om

310
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,620
it's better than previous one look less

311
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,100
and look we need to iterate the numbers

312
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:17,040
from 1 to n and inside is for one

313
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,440
constant previously the pin function

314
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,060
takes login so oh and login now we're

315
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,680
improving this pin and to o1 right

316
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,800
there are quite a few other ways like

317
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,839
you said multiply it by two until we get

318
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,540
this number of big energy oh we divided

319
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,480
by two until we can divide it or we get

320
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,700
one right or we can do this get the log

321
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,519
function Master Lock

322
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:45,779
to phase two and we check if this is a

323
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,660
whole integer dot is integer or with 2

324
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:51,000
is x equals we first get the integer

325
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,339
part of the log I2 we get the log

326
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,860
function here and then we check if 2 to

327
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:59,579
the power of x equals equal I log

328
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:02,339
function log A to B what's this equals c

329
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:04,500
we talk about log here log n what's the

330
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,320
login what's log function

331
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,839
um

332
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,880
is it like

333
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:15,420
look ABC

334
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,320
we can get a to the power C equals B log

335
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,820
2

336
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,220
log 2 x equals y right so we can write

337
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,600
this as 2 to the power of Y equals X

338
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,300
right

339
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,959
2 to the power of Y equals X so we can

340
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,120
say y equals log 2 x am I right

341
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,579
yeah make sense

342
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,150
okay so to sum up what have you learned

343
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,779
today

344
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:42,300
[Music]

345
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:44,639
not just a single word tell me what's

346
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,899
the problem what are we trying to solve

347
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,019
here what have you learned what's the

348
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,399
approach uh try to say three to four

349
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:52,500
sentence

350
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,620
okay that's a good exercise to you okay

351
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,899
so can you say what's the problem and

352
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,940
what are we trying to solve here what's

353
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,440
the problem and how are we solving it

354
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,240
and that's it go

355
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,079
so we

356
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,060
um have these numbers and uh

357
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,920
and

358
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,399
so we wanna

359
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:18,240
so we won't like the number like

360
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,519
the binary numbers and yeah binary is

361
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,380
concatenation of binary numbers and then

362
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,899
we want to convert it back to integer

363
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:28,620
right we don't get this number right

364
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:32,480
yeah yeah so we just

365
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:36,899
figure out the convert the numbers to

366
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,120
Binary and then we can see like um

367
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,220
how many

368
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,860
like

369
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:49,500
like uh spaces we move forward I think

370
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:52,160
uh energy minus two because you don't

371
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:57,240
need a Bo stuck

372
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:59,639
okay yeah so we convert it to Binary

373
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,940
here because we want to find out how

374
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,400
many lengths the length of the next

375
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:09,120
integer in binary format and because we

376
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,860
need to move this answer to partition or

377
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,620
three partition B partition to the left

378
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,299
and plus I will just police number to

379
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:19,380
you know on the right on the right got

380
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:21,620
it okay okay let's see for today bye-bye

381
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,620
bye

382
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:28,260
nice hello hello Mr Ryan are you right

383
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,000
yeah okay so we talk about binary in the

384
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,880
past right the binary

385
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,340
finally numbers yes in computers

386
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,059
computers I understand binary zero and

387
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,580
one

388
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:40,260
the other one is two there are two

389
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,539
states one is that two states the

390
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,600
computers

391
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:47,880
yeah the computer the binary is uh very

392
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,880
friendly to computers why because

393
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,260
they're because the power yeah something

394
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,940
to do with the power because there are

395
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,980
two states you know the power you plug

396
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,039
it in on and off and the power we can

397
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,679
defend the circuit to represent the zero

398
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,200
and one using the high voltage of low

399
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,900
voltage right so zero one binaries

400
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,299
everything in computers is the in binary

401
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,260
let's look at the first few numbers yeah

402
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:16,620
zero one two three four five six seven

403
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:19,140
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen

404
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,320
fourteen fifteen sixteen okay let's look

405
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,539
at this 17 numbers so in binary I write

406
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,940
a few can you write the next okay so

407
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:29,940
this is the decimal and we want to

408
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,160
convert it to Binary zero one obviously

409
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,900
texting them the numbers we're using

410
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,160
today the number 16 we're using today

411
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,500
zero to nine that's the number 10 digits

412
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,960
zero one two two nine right so when you

413
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,480
plus one to nine it carries over to one

414
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,039
zero right and then continue to 99 when

415
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,440
you press one here

416
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,559
it becomes a hundred right because nine

417
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,760
carry over to zero carry one here to

418
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,240
zero

419
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,820
one yeah okay

420
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,840
so what to do in binary one zero one

421
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,400
zero okay three one one four

422
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,780
um one

423
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,740
one zero zero yes five

424
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,140
um

425
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,520
the first one here so what happened nine

426
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,520
zero one okay next

427
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:24,059
um one one one zero yes we're done keep

428
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,100
going one one one yes

429
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:29,700
um so we are running after our digits

430
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,600
here so plus one here zero well done and

431
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,760
then

432
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,760
one zero zero one yes

433
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:41,100
um

434
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:44,460
one one zero one zero yes

435
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,260
um one zero one one well done wow you're

436
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,660
on fire today

437
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,660
um one one zero zero yes

438
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:03,600
yes

439
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:05,700
okay one zero zero zero zero well done

440
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,960
look this one too

441
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,600
four

442
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,179
four eight

443
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,240
sixteen can you notice that something in

444
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:18,960
common about this 2 4 8 6 what happened

445
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,299
they will add just one and zero one for

446
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,000
Blue by some zero right one

447
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:25,620
followed by zero yeah follow y one zero

448
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,179
that's two to the power one followed by

449
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,900
two zero two to the power two all right

450
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:34,679
look how do we convert this in binary

451
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:39,059
this this is one this is two

452
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:42,919
this is for this is a this is 16. so

453
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:42,919
it's 16 plus eight plus one

454
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,120
right yeah this is 25 okay so look if

455
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,240
it's a power of two then all the rest

456
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,480
will be zero right yeah so look this is

457
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,940
each each digit yeah on its own is power

458
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,039
of two so that's the way we check if the

459
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,600
number is Tau of two okay so we're given

460
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,880
the integer n

461
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,340
so for example n equals three so we put

462
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,280
a number the integer number here one two

463
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:14,160
three okay what's one in finally one

464
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,580
what's two in binary one zero plus three

465
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,860
in battery one one weather okay now we

466
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:23,840
put this together so it becomes one one

467
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,840
zero one one so what's being decimal

468
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,539
okay so we press these together which is

469
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,720
the

470
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:35,159
27 right how do we solve this problem

471
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,340
any idea right

472
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,340
um we

473
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,059
look we first of all this is the digits

474
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,039
we convert to Binary we put the binary

475
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,299
together concatenation of a binary

476
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,299
string

477
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:53,780
and we convert back to the text symbol

478
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,780
from the boundary

479
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,700
well that's another more which is which

480
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,299
is for

481
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,120
if we have another digit 4 which is one

482
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:07,460
zero zero

483
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,460
one zero zero right even numbers always

484
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
yeah yeah I know we convert this to

485
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,080
decimals

486
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,820
yeah

487
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,780
how would you do it

488
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,780
any idea okay

489
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,860
I mean you can ask computer to do the

490
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:30,720
exact step right all right let's move

491
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,720
forward we can ask the computer to do

492
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,539
exactly the same thing first of all we

493
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,460
convert numbers to Binary I will put it

494
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:41,280
together and we just convert it to

495
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:44,100
decimal look each step is known and we

496
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,980
can do it right and it's n right we know

497
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,559
this n so first of all we want to get

498
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,840
the numbers one two three first of all

499
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,299
we know we want to convert it to Binary

500
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,480
which is one

501
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:59,820
one zero one one right so we use the

502
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,159
function called bin yeah we talk about

503
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,500
the equivalent right how do we get a

504
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,320
binary from the decimal so you know how

505
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,539
to convert from binary to decimal from

506
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,780
decimal to Binary right one easy way

507
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:14,460
look how do we convert the 7 to Binary

508
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:18,480
seven

509
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:22,260
divided by two three remain one

510
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,500
three divided by two one remain one

511
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,360
divided by two zero remain one once is

512
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,440
zero we call this backwards so it's one

513
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,150
one one

514
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,480
make sense

515
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,960
[Music]

516
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,980
pin three equals

517
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,760
zero P one one okay so let's string the

518
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:45,120
final string you prefix with zero P bury

519
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:52,200
this in mind okay for example pin

520
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:55,140
hey you will give us 0p 1 0 0 okay

521
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,080
this function pin stands for binary not

522
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:02,220
a trash bin okay rubbish so we use this

523
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,880
pin function so array equals pin

524
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,880
I

525
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:12,419
for I in range

526
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,059
1 to n plus one inclusive

527
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:17,580
one to n okay basically but look at this

528
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:19,159
pin as I said there's a prefix a we

529
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,140
don't want this right

530
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:25,320
we don't want this glob so we can just

531
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:28,740
cut it from the third position to the

532
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,240
end two to the end right

533
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,220
then

534
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,960
we have this array right we have this

535
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,760
array and we want to put it together so

536
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,919
look we have this

537
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,320
we have this how do we put these things

538
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,360
together we use the function we want to

539
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,960
join it right so we can just join it

540
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,120
Jump by empty space join away

541
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,679
and once we have this string we want to

542
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,960
convert it back to integer in the

543
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,480
function convert it back to integer base

544
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,620
two this second parameter two means that

545
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:02,100
first parameter is a number in

546
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:04,200
base 2 which is final okay so we can

547
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,940
even do this in one line right return

548
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,840
end

549
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:12,659
empty string join this whole thing two

550
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,880
and the time complexity we as we need to

551
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:18,059
iterate overly and integers

552
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,820
all right so let's o n for each number

553
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:23,700
we call this bin function so that's

554
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,740
going to take o log n times so Ln Times

555
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,559
log n but we can do better

556
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,500
look I have one now now the next number

557
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,460
is 2 right I know it's one zero in

558
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,440
binary

559
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,059
so what happened to this one Lexi

560
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,260
integer coming one zero what happened to

561
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,179
this one

562
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,100
what happened

563
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,779
um what happened it was originally on

564
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,580
this place but it now moved to this

565
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:47,580
place it moves two space to the left

566
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,640
right yeah so another individual one one

567
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:54,000
comes one line comes what happened to

568
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,340
Karen in numbers it was like that now I

569
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,340
squeezed two numbers in so what happened

570
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:02,279
to this look at this way now one I put a

571
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:05,460
zero at the end one

572
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:08,400
one zero what's this two one zero zero

573
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,440
what's this four this number one I put a

574
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,779
zero at the end what happened to this

575
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,520
value one two one zero what happened to

576
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:17,220
the value put another zero at the end

577
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,779
what happened to the value I have put

578
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,600
another one zero at the end what

579
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:24,600
happened in

580
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,460
it doubles the number it doubles the

581
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,200
number that's the thing one what

582
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,900
happened if I put a zero at the end what

583
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,340
what happened to the value it doubles it

584
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,860
doubles that becomes two if I put

585
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,480
another one it becomes four right it

586
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,580
works for an integer for example this is

587
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,659
one one zero what's this value is four

588
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:43,020
plus two

589
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,240
is six right because I put a zero here

590
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,159
at the end what's the value

591
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,159
12 12 right

592
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,140
and then 34 exactly right and it works

593
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,480
the other way around if I take a zero if

594
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,760
the value divided by two all right any

595
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,620
value right any value I put a zero there

596
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,740
each value

597
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:04,020
shift one partition to the left it means

598
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,419
that it the number it represent the

599
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,980
value we present on that single digit

600
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,799
times two

601
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,760
right times two so the whole value times

602
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,059
two

603
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,059
okay so now coming back to this

604
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:20,520
one one zero the next number is one one

605
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:22,679
the one one is two digits so the

606
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,500
existing values

607
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:28,200
shift two position to the left the value

608
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,179
doubles twice right

609
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,760
now we can do it this way look

610
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:35,220
I okay now current value is one right

611
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,760
now comes another one zero okay

612
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:42,059
so now current value needs to

613
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,919
shift to position to the left right

614
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:47,279
shift to position to the left and plus

615
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,559
this value now it's one one zero now

616
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,500
comes to eleven I put two earlier and it

617
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:55,140
means that the carbon existing value the

618
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,120
carbon value moves two position to the

619
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:03,240
left am I

620
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:06,480
answer equals zero for I in range start

621
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,480
with 1 to n right so n plus one

622
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:14,460
not including n plus one is n okay now

623
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:16,740
the current digit is let's say x equals

624
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,860
the pin function right pin function I

625
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,659
convert the I to pin but we want to get

626
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,000
the length right we only get the length

627
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,039
length of it we need to subtract two

628
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,760
answer

629
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,520
shift shift equals x we move we shift

630
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,940
the X position to the left and then

631
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:39,240
answer plus equal I return answer

632
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,640
okay you see two steps

633
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,039
now I'm one right the next number comes

634
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,380
is one zero right so first of all what

635
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:48,419
do I do with this one x equals two right

636
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,659
x equals two one zero the length is two

637
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:54,840
digits I put a two zero

638
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:55,860
only one right and then I add the one

639
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,419
zero

640
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,760
oh yeah so it's become more window

641
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,440
simple that's two steps that's it the

642
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,960
time can let's see look we need to

643
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,940
iterate n digit and numbers

644
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,980
for each one we're still using the pin

645
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,860
something so it's all and organ as well

646
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,840
right so it's not improving it's not

647
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,880
improving but we can actually do it

648
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,380
better why is that look just a third

649
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,539
this person okay what happened to the

650
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:23,640
lens one one zero one one one zero zero

651
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:27,380
one zero one one one zero one one one

652
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,380
one zero zero zero

653
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:37,500
look at the length one digit

654
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,179
two digit two digit three digit three

655
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
digits three digits three digits four

656
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,539
digits

657
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,419
four digit five digit

658
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:47,399
so do you see the pattern when will the

659
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,520
length the tip the number of digits

660
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:52,320
increase

661
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,020
yes okay so look you see

662
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,640
one to two

663
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,200
two to three

664
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,860
three to four

665
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,260
and then here is four to five so in what

666
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,000
cases what number we can increase the

667
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,580
number of digits

668
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,100
what happened here one two two one zero

669
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:13,080
we increase one digit two to three we

670
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,700
increase one digit three to four we

671
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,960
increase one digit so you see the

672
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,720
pattern here

673
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,140
what's the pattern so look what my top

674
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,140
number increase

675
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,500
one important number increases a digit

676
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,500
by zero

677
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:37,100
okay so look at least number two

678
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:44,279
what's this for what's at least a what's

679
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,100
it is 16. so we can increase when the

680
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:48,480
number is 2 4 8 16. so what's this

681
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:53,480
number

682
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:56,760
two for a sixteen what are those numbers

683
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,620
power of two right yeah Power of Two so

684
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,200
we can increase by power of two one

685
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,279
followed by a lot of zero right and

686
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,159
zeros

687
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,840
2 to the power M this number binary is 2

688
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:09,659
to the power of n we don't need to

689
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,179
calculate the lens every time x equals

690
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:16,679
zero right at the beginning then we

691
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:19,620
check if I is power of two yeah if I is

692
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,720
power of two then we X Plus equal so we

693
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,580
incremental length if x is power two

694
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,559
then we increment the length so how do

695
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,480
we check if a number is pi over 2 right

696
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:30,720
how do we check if the number is power

697
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,760
two how do we know 16 is power of 2 by

698
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,840
17 is not power two there are a couple

699
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:39,539
ways

700
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:43,799
you go to the beginning number zero you

701
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:47,279
well you add one and then you do and

702
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:49,020
then you double it and and if you pass

703
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,000
it

704
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,700
um

705
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,340
you can keep time from it we're done one

706
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,159
two four what's the opposite way

707
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,659
dividing it without always yeah you can

708
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,440
do this times

709
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:07,440
um multiply until it's equal or bigger

710
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,299
than it right or you can divide it if it

711
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,919
aren't here it's one or you can't be

712
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:13,500
divided oh it's an odd number I'm right

713
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:14,700
this is the power of two right look at

714
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,039
these numbers

715
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,799
they are Power of Two

716
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,460
do you notice the the pattern the power

717
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:26,279
of two in binary one one zero one zero

718
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,039
zero one zero zero zero one zero zero

719
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:31,679
zero zero okay so do you not notice the

720
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:35,100
pattern if a number is power of two in

721
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,260
binary it follows by this pattern am I

722
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,779
so if it's a power of two single one

723
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,580
followed by loss of zero am I so what

724
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:43,679
happens if we subtract one from this

725
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,919
number

726
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,779
did you left one digital and this

727
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,760
teaching gone and what's next what's

728
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:54,120
this number one one what's this number

729
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,960
one lots of one right yeah

730
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,960
if we do a n

731
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,399
needs to be true one and one is one all

732
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,919
others are zero if we do a n operation

733
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,799
or these then you become zero so that's

734
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,539
a quick way to check if a integer is a

735
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:12,000
power of two so we can do this if

736
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:14,580
integer is I then we can say if

737
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,080
I is bigger than zero obviously it can't

738
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:22,860
be zero right I thicker than zero and

739
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:26,820
I and I minus 1 needs to be zero

740
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:29,039
right look but here look I is from one

741
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:32,399
so we can get rid of this so we can just

742
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,919
say if I and I minus one the N operation

743
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,559
is zero and then we increment the length

744
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,620
two numbers two English n operation a

745
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:42,779
bit operation the end of exclusive or

746
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,779
you know those kind of thing is all one

747
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:47,399
constant so this time complexity is just

748
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:50,880
o n

749
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:53,000
a loop with n iterations and everything

750
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,380
inside is constant

751
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,140
there are a couple ways as you said we

752
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,600
can check the numbers uh even if to see

753
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,000
if it's a power of 2 by multiplying or

754
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,860
dividing we can do this another way we

755
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,880
can check the block function we can do

756
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,880
this master lock

757
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:15,179
I2 right and this is written

758
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,940
a number but we just have to check if

759
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,919
it's a whole integer okay

760
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,139
it's a whole integer that's also okay

761
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,200
remember if it's a power of two then we

762
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:29,460
can say log 2 to the power of uh what's

763
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,659
the block function block to n equals

764
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,700
why

765
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,020
look what's this

766
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,899
lock

767
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,839
we talk about log functions right it's 2

768
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:41,700
to the power y equals n right and we can

769
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,339
write it in log function look log

770
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,080
function of a this is equal to three two

771
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:49,320
to the power of three equals a

772
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,839
right this is a number that it's not a

773
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,179
problem two then this number is not a

774
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,919
whole integer right so another way we

775
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,380
can get this number for example and

776
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:01,200
convert it to an integer in and then we

777
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:05,160
check backwards so 2 to the power of uh

778
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,680
this integer if it's equals to I

779
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,580
then it's a power of two okay that's it

780
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,580
for today bye-bye
