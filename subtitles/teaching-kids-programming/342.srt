1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
so

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,000
hello mr erin mr ryan how are you today

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,800
okay

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,519
so let's look at these sublist again

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,799
0 1 5 3

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,960
4.

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,440
and then i given a range like

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,840
from one to four

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,840
okay so

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,320
this is a sub list let's say the lines

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,359
and we want to find out the the number

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,360
of sub list with maximum between this

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:36,079
range so let's take an example so

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,280
the sub is the three and four right

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,280
this sum is three and four

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,600
what's the the maximum is four is

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,920
between this range so this is okay

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,920
and then

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,079
one

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,760
three

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,360
four

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,120
yeah these are all okay these are all

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,640
surface which is the maximum is between

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,000
this range right how about zero one

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,560
yeah it's okay so how many of them

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,560
yeah no not a lot just five right

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,640
so if the surface is the

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,320
five

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,280
five elements in a certain how many

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,280
zombies together

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,960
how many sub list for if this size is n

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,960
yeah fifteen how do we get it because we

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,240
also can be a sublet we've had two or

34
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,799
more okay so use the f

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,040
c one and plus

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,360
c one two one

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,600
onion okay and then

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,600
and then

39
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,079
okay okay look you're basically right

40
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,159
yeah so let me fill out an element so

41
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,240
you want to pick one out of m that means

42
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,239
that the service was only single one

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,800
single element like instead of five

44
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,959
three four or one if we pick two it

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
means that we start we pick two index

46
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,879
that's left and the right right so

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,040
you'll be the sub list which with more

48
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,879
than one element so this is m plus

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,360
n times n minus 1 divided by 2

50
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,400
so if i put a 2 n over 2 this is the

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,160
same thing so we will get

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,680
10

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,080
and m plus 1 divided by 2 okay so look

54
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,599
this is the formula of the sum for the

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,080
first few integers right so five will be

56
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,640
one plus two plus three look n equals

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,120
five you'll be one plus two plus three

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,920
plus four four minus five equals fifteen

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,360
right so if you put a plus 5 in

60
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,120
5 times

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,040
5 plus 1 divided by 2 that gives us

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,159
15 as well okay

63
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,159
so that's how we get it

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,280
so

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,519
um so one example is that how can we

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,840
solve this problem i mean obviously if

67
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,440
we can go for the proof of thing yeah if

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,720
we prove us all the subjects that's

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,400
going to take us o and square term but

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,280
to check

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,519
yeah yeah because it needs another on to

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,920
take to check to get the maximum of the

73
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,280
sub list and then to compare if it's

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,720
between this wave

75
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,480
let's do this profile thing first

76
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,480
let's do this first things first okay

77
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,840
at the meantime you need to think uh

78
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,159
what kind of accurate can we use to make

79
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,959
it faster

80
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,720
faster uh using your brain

81
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,920
yeah using my brand but how about your

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,319
brain

83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,600
completely computer brain but we need to

84
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,239
test computer okay let's say

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,640
[Music]

86
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,319
let's say today is day yeah okay let's

87
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,519
say f okay the nums and then we have uh

88
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,519
uh lower in the upper lower and right

89
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,720
okay

90
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,319
so answer equals zero

91
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,840
all right we on the column and put it in

92
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,120
the lens i'm putting the answer and the

93
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,519
lens the let's say we n equal

94
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,479
length number right

95
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,360
and then we need to pull forward f4

96
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,240
i

97
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,160
in

98
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,960
range alright yeah

99
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,840
french and color

100
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,560
and then for j basically we are we are

101
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,160
forcing the left and right and then

102
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,560
the left and right could be the same so

103
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,320
we start with i

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,919
and then up to n right

105
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,880
okay another service what's the

106
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,600
summaries

107
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,759
s

108
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,199
equals nums

109
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,880
look nums

110
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,120
and then start with i up to j plus one

111
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,080
right inclusive because up to j plus one

112
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,880
means i j inclusive this is the service

113
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,320
right

114
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,880
but we want to get the maximum so if

115
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,320
if okay so air smaller equal than the

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,039
maximum of the sub is s smaller equal

117
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,039
maximum

118
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,520
what did i just say ryan what's the come

119
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,520
from okay look oh n

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
another loop

121
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,080
square

122
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,560
and at least one

123
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,960
this one takes another o and so o and

124
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,039
cubic okay

125
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,520
space complexity when you're using any

126
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,360
space so that's our one constant

127
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,360
uh

128
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,759
to be strict we are using constant term

129
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,160
of space okay we are using this answer

130
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,479
but it's constantly it's not it's not

131
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,000
when i say we are not using space that's

132
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,360
not quite right okay we're using

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,039
constant time of space so it's open

134
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,639
make sense yeah but how's that strict

135
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,080
can you not throw that thing into the

136
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,479
ball please

137
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,479
how's that

138
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,120
strictly speaking strictly speaking when

139
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,759
as what i said

140
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,400
oh we are not using any space that's not

141
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,800
accurate we are using constant term

142
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,720
constant space right because when the

143
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,160
numbers the number of elements in the

144
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,880
numbers grow

145
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,280
it doesn't does not depend on the input

146
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,560
we are still using constant

147
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,560
constant space okay

148
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,960
okay so let's that's the profession

149
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,960
let's prove one thing

150
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,479
keep quiet okay

151
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,039
so let's say

152
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,360
we want to find out this max a

153
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,280
is smaller than the right and smaller

154
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,400
than air right

155
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,720
so how about if i calculate the

156
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,120
calculated part which is smaller than r

157
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,599
first right so you increase

158
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,360
look if i put the numbers here right so

159
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,840
i want to put i want to count how many

160
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,840
in the range right yeah probably in a

161
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,880
range right i want to count how many in

162
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,960
a range here this part yeah

163
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,639
how about if i say okay i first of all i

164
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,319
calculate this part

165
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
this is a

166
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,720
and then you cut off and then i

167
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,280
calculate this part l minus one is here

168
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,599
i calculate this part

169
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,800
and then you cuddle this is b

170
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,800
so what's the answer here

171
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,120
so this bit this i want to calculate

172
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,720
this bit c okay c is between the numbers

173
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,639
between this bit

174
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,520
c is between

175
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,800
the air to r inclusive yeah

176
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,000
so now i calculate it okay so a is the

177
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,680
part

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
between the minus minus infinity to

179
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:02,160
to r inclusive and then b is the part

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,199
minus inclusive to l minus one

181
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,280
okay so what's the answer c

182
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,280
come on from the front of the graph

183
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,280
i want to take this bit

184
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,280
and now i know this strip and i know

185
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,319
this speed so what's this bit

186
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,160
that's it

187
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,000
yeah so c equals y

188
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,960
c equals

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,400
b

190
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,759
b is this speed a a minus b yeah a minus

191
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,120
b exactly c

192
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,440
a minus b

193
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,199
okay so the same here

194
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,199
we want to calculate the num we on the

195
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,519
count number of sub list right number of

196
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,479
sub is that the maximum

197
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,959
is between this range so let's say we we

198
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,800
count the number of sublease which is

199
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,039
smaller than r and the number of solid

200
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,399
which is smaller than the maximum sub uh

201
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,720
value of sub is smaller than l minus one

202
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,080
right and then a minus b now we can do

203
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,920
this twice right

204
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,720
we calculate

205
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,600
so basically we calculate f r i know we

206
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,160
calculate f l minus 1 i know we minus it

207
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,200
that will be the answer make sense

208
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,519
yeah

209
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,560
so now how do we calculate this this is

210
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,320
the

211
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,640
thing we need to

212
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,640
know okay

213
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,600
so let's say look i have a service if

214
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,120
it's

215
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,959
if it's satisfied okay um 100 here this

216
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,440
is the maximum i want to

217
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,440
the upper bound okay maximum okay one

218
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,360
how many of this

219
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,640
uh one

220
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,560
another number like hey how many surveys

221
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,880
three

222
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,760
ten how many sundays

223
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,440
six

224
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,839
okay so you keep adding that how about

225
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,360
lee how about now i add a thousand how

226
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,519
many service

227
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,200
do you edit

228
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,959
you don't like it right

229
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,480
no because you can't edit because this

230
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,839
is more than 100 so so we set it to zero

231
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,040
okay and now how many stop lists one

232
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,040
exactly how many zombies

233
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,959
yeah okay you get it

234
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,760
yeah i know we can count it yeah we're

235
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,120
done okay so that's the way right we

236
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,240
have a

237
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,320
current counter we accumulate

238
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,720
as long as the current number is smaller

239
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,720
than the upper bound

240
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,720
right

241
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,399
define

242
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,200
well let's say

243
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,360
f okay this is the num uh that's the

244
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,079
upper bound let's say the upper bound

245
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:35,920
upper bound

246
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:38,000
so current equal answer equals zero and

247
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,720
we go through this number for i in

248
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,720
numbers right

249
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,240
if i smaller equal than upper bound

250
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,399
and then i need to current equal plus

251
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,720
equal to one right else i need to reset

252
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,640
it to zero right

253
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,519
and then answer plus equals column right

254
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,680
yeah

255
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,399
yeah look if we smaller than an upper

256
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,720
bound we accumulate the one right and we

257
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,120
add the atom

258
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,040
as a length right so it's one plus two

259
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,079
plus three plus four right that's how

260
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,079
you get something number of times

261
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,079
i don't know the final return is written

262
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,240
returns f

263
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,040
r minus f

264
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,360
l minus one okay

265
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,519
what's the term complexity here

266
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,959
this is all n right because we're going

267
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,240
through the numbers

268
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,560
a for loop

269
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,839
exactly yeah the space a constant time

270
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,279
how many times we need to call this

271
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,279
function

272
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,040
yeah call this one call this one so

273
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,880
that's o n

274
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,760
plus o n

275
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,440
is

276
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,920
o to n

277
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,720
but we drop a constant so it's o n okay

278
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
yay

279
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,360
make sense

280
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,360
okay good job today bye
