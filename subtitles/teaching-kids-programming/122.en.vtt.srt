hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today

2
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today
 

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,030
hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today
so can you remind me what's the binary

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,040
so can you remind me what's the binary
 

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,629
so can you remind me what's the binary
tree

6
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
tree
 

7
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,470
tree
what are your numbers numbers can you

8
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480
what are your numbers numbers can you
 

9
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,870
what are your numbers numbers can you
draw a final two please

10
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
draw a final two please
 

11
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,470
draw a final two please
i'll draw it's not numbered it's a tree

12
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
i'll draw it's not numbered it's a tree
 

13
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,710
i'll draw it's not numbered it's a tree
you know but with the numbers yes upside

14
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
you know but with the numbers yes upside
 

15
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,109
you know but with the numbers yes upside
down yeah and where is the loot

16
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119

 

17
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,150

okay can you also maybe you can make a

18
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
okay can you also maybe you can make a
 

19
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,230
okay can you also maybe you can make a
binary search tree do you remember oh

20
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,240
binary search tree do you remember oh
 

21
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,870
binary search tree do you remember oh
yeah oh can you make a partnership

22
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
yeah oh can you make a partnership
 

23
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,870
yeah oh can you make a partnership
obviously by the research tree is one

24
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
obviously by the research tree is one
 

25
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,229
obviously by the research tree is one
kind of binary okay

26
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
kind of binary okay
 

27
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,590
kind of binary okay
yeah and that's yeah we're done

28
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
yeah and that's yeah we're done
 

29
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,630
yeah and that's yeah we're done
i'll put

30
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:42,640

 

31
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,549

okay

32
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559

 

33
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,709

okay so can you explain to me why what

34
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
okay so can you explain to me why what
 

35
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,020
okay so can you explain to me why what
is this man is a street

36
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,030
is this man is a street
 

37
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,630
is this man is a street
[Music]

38
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640

 

39
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,430

the next one is smaller than the loop

40
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
the next one is smaller than the loop
 

41
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,310
the next one is smaller than the loop
and the right one

42
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
and the right one
 

43
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,229
and the right one
is bigger yeah strictly bigger so look

44
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
is bigger yeah strictly bigger so look
 

45
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,390
is bigger yeah strictly bigger so look
at these all the notes in the left tree

46
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
at these all the notes in the left tree
 

47
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,429
at these all the notes in the left tree
are strictly smaller than four right so

48
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
are strictly smaller than four right so
 

49
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,070
are strictly smaller than four right so
even these

50
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
even these
 

51
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,070
even these
if you can put a here because a is

52
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
if you can put a here because a is
 

53
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,109
if you can put a here because a is
bigger than four

54
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
bigger than four
 

55
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,230
bigger than four
yeah even if satisfy a is bigger than

56
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
yeah even if satisfy a is bigger than
 

57
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,149
yeah even if satisfy a is bigger than
two so all the left trees

58
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
two so all the left trees
 

59
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,310
two so all the left trees
must be smaller than the parents all the

60
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
must be smaller than the parents all the
 

61
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,310
must be smaller than the parents all the
right two must be bigger than right

62
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
right two must be bigger than right
 

63
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,190
right two must be bigger than right
now yeah yeah that's very good um okay

64
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
now yeah yeah that's very good um okay
 

65
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,030
now yeah yeah that's very good um okay
so

66
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
so
 

67
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,910
so
no that's it so how about look if if

68
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
no that's it so how about look if if
 

69
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,590
no that's it so how about look if if
let's say eric

70
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
let's say eric
 

71
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,190
let's say eric
yeah is seven and one

72
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
yeah is seven and one
 

73
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,870
yeah is seven and one
okay okay okay eight eight okay

74
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
okay okay okay eight eight okay
 

75
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,230
okay okay okay eight eight okay
eight a lion is what i'm seven

76
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
eight a lion is what i'm seven
 

77
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,950
eight a lion is what i'm seven
oh then i can't put a let's pretend you

78
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
oh then i can't put a let's pretend you
 

79
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,149
oh then i can't put a let's pretend you
are two okay

80
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
are two okay
 

81
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,789
are two okay
can i because it it doesn't satisfy the

82
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
can i because it it doesn't satisfy the
 

83
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,350
can i because it it doesn't satisfy the
final

84
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
final
 

85
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,710
final
street okay i can make one okay

86
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
street okay i can make one okay
 

87
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:59,510
street okay i can make one okay
hmm that's that

88
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520

 

89
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,670

but this does not satisfy though let's

90
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
but this does not satisfy though let's
 

91
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,230
but this does not satisfy though let's
change this to 7.5

92
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
change this to 7.5
 

93
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,270
change this to 7.5
right and then this needs to be bigger

94
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
right and then this needs to be bigger
 

95
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,749
right and then this needs to be bigger
let's

96
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
let's
 

97
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,630
let's
put it at 7.2 okay and then that would

98
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
put it at 7.2 okay and then that would
 

99
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,550
put it at 7.2 okay and then that would
be one okay let's apprentice that's true

100
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
be one okay let's apprentice that's true
 

101
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,949
be one okay let's apprentice that's true
and then

102
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
and then
 

103
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,229
and then
seven is y and eric's is eight is okay

104
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
seven is y and eric's is eight is okay
 

105
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,910
seven is y and eric's is eight is okay
yeah my parent is 7.5 okay that's fine

106
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
yeah my parent is 7.5 okay that's fine
 

107
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,710
yeah my parent is 7.5 okay that's fine
okay so now

108
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
okay so now
 

109
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,750
okay so now
the target is like the if i give you uh

110
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
the target is like the if i give you uh
 

111
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,830
the target is like the if i give you uh
if i want to find the sibling you know

112
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
if i want to find the sibling you know
 

113
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,550
if i want to find the sibling you know
the sibling

114
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560

 

115
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,190

brothers yeah brother sister shipping

116
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
brothers yeah brother sister shipping
 

117
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,830
brothers yeah brother sister shipping
okay so

118
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
okay so
 

119
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,750
okay so
suppose i want to find the brothers of

120
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
suppose i want to find the brothers of
 

121
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:46,869
suppose i want to find the brothers of
eric that needs to

122
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879

 

123
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,190

how do you do this what's the idea how

124
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
how do you do this what's the idea how
 

125
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,750
how do you do this what's the idea how
how are we dealing with this problem

126
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
how are we dealing with this problem
 

127
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,910
how are we dealing with this problem
so basically you're finding the cream in

128
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
so basically you're finding the cream in
 

129
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,990
so basically you're finding the cream in
the binary search tree

130
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
the binary search tree
 

131
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,270
the binary search tree
okay remember it's final research

132
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
okay remember it's final research
 

133
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,670
okay remember it's final research
yeah how are we using these finances but

134
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
yeah how are we using these finances but
 

135
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,110
yeah how are we using these finances but
first of all

136
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
first of all
 

137
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,190
first of all
paul we're finding a node in the binary

138
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
paul we're finding a node in the binary
 

139
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,910
paul we're finding a node in the binary
search tree

140
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920

 

141
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,949

uh we start from the root yeah if it's

142
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
uh we start from the root yeah if it's
 

143
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,630
uh we start from the root yeah if it's
smaller

144
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
smaller
 

145
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,149
smaller
you go to the right

146
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
you go to the right
 

147
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,149
you go to the right
which one is smaller go to the right oh

148
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
which one is smaller go to the right oh
 

149
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,350
which one is smaller go to the right oh
yeah

150
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
yeah
 

151
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,070
yeah
if if we uh if the one you're looking

152
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
if if we uh if the one you're looking
 

153
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,430
if if we uh if the one you're looking
for is smaller

154
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
for is smaller
 

155
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,430
for is smaller
you're gonna don't need the project a

156
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
you're gonna don't need the project a
 

157
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,190
you're gonna don't need the project a
long time no go to the right

158
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
long time no go to the right
 

159
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,789
long time no go to the right
go to the left because you wanna look

go to the left because you wanna look
you want to find the area which is

162
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
you want to find the area which is
 

163
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,750

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,670
the right and which is smaller
you go to the left right yeah okay so

168
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
you go to the left right yeah okay so
 

169
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,070
you go to the left right yeah okay so
this

170
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
this
 

171
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,030
this
what's the time complexity of this one

172
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
what's the time complexity of this one
 

173
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,670
what's the time complexity of this one
if there are

174
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
if there are
 

175
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,910
if there are
n and trees in the final

176
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
n and trees in the final
 

177
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,270
n and trees in the final
sorry i knows in the balance search tree

178
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280

 

179
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,949

are you sure we are using the final

180
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:54,959
are you sure we are using the final
 

181
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,309
are you sure we are using the final
search tool

182
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
search tool
 

183
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,589
search tool
if if the tree something if the tree is

184
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
if if the tree something if the tree is
 

185
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,509
if if the tree something if the tree is
highly balanced you know high dependence

186
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
highly balanced you know high dependence
 

187
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,710
highly balanced you know high dependence
right so so in the worst case if it's

188
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
right so so in the worst case if it's
 

189
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,030
right so so in the worst case if it's
not

190
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
not
 

191
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,149
not
high dependence it's all one but in the

192
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
high dependence it's all one but in the
 

193
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,990
high dependence it's all one but in the
optimum case no in the optimum

194
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
optimum case no in the optimum
 

195
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,750
optimum case no in the optimum
i mean the tree is highly balanced every

196
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
i mean the tree is highly balanced every
 

197
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,229
i mean the tree is highly balanced every
time i cut into the search space

198
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
time i cut into the search space
 

199
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,509
time i cut into the search space
by two so what's that i'll end

200
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
by two so what's that i'll end
 

201
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,069
by two so what's that i'll end
the body waiting no we're not talking

202
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
the body waiting no we're not talking
 

203
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,870
the body waiting no we're not talking
about constants here so every time i cut

204
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
about constants here so every time i cut
 

205
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,870
about constants here so every time i cut
look if there are eight notes every time

206
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
look if there are eight notes every time
 

207
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,270
look if there are eight notes every time
i search it i i cut into four

208
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
i search it i i cut into four
 

209
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,510
i search it i i cut into four
at two and i search for notes and i

210
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
at two and i search for notes and i
 

211
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,390
at two and i search for notes and i
again i may get

212
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
again i may get
 

213
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,629
again i may get
one check and i search to two so what's

214
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
one check and i search to two so what's
 

215
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,070
one check and i search to two so what's
kind this kind of thing

216
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
kind this kind of thing
 

217
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,430
kind this kind of thing
every time i cut into half remember

218
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
every time i cut into half remember
 

219
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,510
every time i cut into half remember
remember the binary search remember

220
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
remember the binary search remember
 

221
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,550
remember the binary search remember
every time

222
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
every time
 

223
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,070
every time
look at yeah yeah my favorite one

224
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
look at yeah yeah my favorite one
 

225
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,950
look at yeah yeah my favorite one
yeah again yeah if the tree is highly

226
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
yeah again yeah if the tree is highly
 

227
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,550
yeah again yeah if the tree is highly
balanced

228
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
balanced
 

229
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,550
balanced
if not kylie parents what's the term

230
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
if not kylie parents what's the term
 

231
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,670
if not kylie parents what's the term
complex

232
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
complex
 

233
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,270
complex
why is that can you give me an example

234
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
why is that can you give me an example
 

235
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,710
why is that can you give me an example
what in what cases

236
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
what in what cases
 

237
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,629
what in what cases
it's not oh uh

238
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639

 

239
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,230

this yeah yeah well it's hot it's like

240
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
this yeah yeah well it's hot it's like
 

241
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,310
this yeah yeah well it's hot it's like
linked list because the final two binary

242
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
linked list because the final two binary
 

243
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,310
linked list because the final two binary
research it can be still final search

244
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
research it can be still final search
 

245
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,790
research it can be still final search
tree

246
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
tree
 

247
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,189
tree
and it will be like one two three four

248
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
and it will be like one two three four
 

249
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,189
and it will be like one two three four
but in order to search for

250
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
but in order to search for
 

251
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,029
but in order to search for
you need to find sweet four times yes

252
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
you need to find sweet four times yes
 

253
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,830
you need to find sweet four times yes
yeah does it make sense so this is not

254
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
yeah does it make sense so this is not
 

255
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,830
yeah does it make sense so this is not
making use of the binary system

256
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
making use of the binary system
 

257
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,629
making use of the binary system
the the characteristics of that okay so

258
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
the the characteristics of that okay so
 

259
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,990
the the characteristics of that okay so
now

260
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
now
 

261
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,790
now
so they we know how to search the note

262
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
so they we know how to search the note
 

263
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,909
so they we know how to search the note
in the binary session

264
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
in the binary session
 

265
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,029
in the binary session
how about we search the siblings so when

266
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
how about we search the siblings so when
 

267
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,710
how about we search the siblings so when
we go to the

268
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
we go to the
 

269
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,670
we go to the
brother so look we know we look for eric

270
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
brother so look we know we look for eric
 

271
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,310
brother so look we know we look for eric
right

272
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
right
 

273
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,830
right
so we know it's on the left side right

274
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
so we know it's on the left side right
 

275
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,670
so we know it's on the left side right
but when we before we go to the left

276
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
but when we before we go to the left
 

277
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,870
but when we before we go to the left
side we know

278
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
side we know
 

279
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,070
side we know
the plot of area of of the

280
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
the plot of area of of the
 

281
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,590
the plot of area of of the
next node is right right did we get it

282
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
next node is right right did we get it
 

283
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,150
next node is right right did we get it
yeah so so we just need to add one more

284
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
yeah so so we just need to add one more
 

285
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,390
yeah so so we just need to add one more
step is that before we go to the left or

286
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
step is that before we go to the left or
 

287
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,390
step is that before we go to the left or
go to the right we remember

288
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
go to the right we remember
 

289
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,029
go to the right we remember
the product note of the number you want

290
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
the product note of the number you want
 

291
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,990
the product note of the number you want
to visit next

292
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
to visit next
 

293
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,110
to visit next
right and suppose okay here i i found a

294
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
right and suppose okay here i i found a
 

295
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,070
right and suppose okay here i i found a
ryan here

296
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
ryan here
 

297
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,550
ryan here
right but before i go to come here i

298
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
right but before i go to come here i
 

299
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,510
right but before i go to come here i
know

300
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
know
 

301
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,550
know
this nose brother is eric so and i

302
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
this nose brother is eric so and i
 

303
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,790
this nose brother is eric so and i
can find it right because each but in

304
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
can find it right because each but in
 

305
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,830
can find it right because each but in
front of the trees

306
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
front of the trees
 

307
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,670
front of the trees
you only have two kids am i right yeah

308
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
you only have two kids am i right yeah
 

309
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,189
you only have two kids am i right yeah
does it make sense yeah

310
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
does it make sense yeah
 

311
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,830
does it make sense yeah
okay so yeah you supposed to read this

312
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
okay so yeah you supposed to read this
 

313
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,510
okay so yeah you supposed to read this
one

314
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
one
 

315
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,629
one
yeah okay so this has some

316
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
yeah okay so this has some
 

317
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,870
yeah okay so this has some
assumption that the planet now always

318
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
assumption that the planet now always
 

319
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,550
assumption that the planet now always
exists okay so you

320
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
exists okay so you
 

321
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,710
exists okay so you
what does that mean it means that my

322
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
what does that mean it means that my
 

323
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,749
what does that mean it means that my
little tree or

324
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
little tree or
 

325
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,550
little tree or
we have each dough will have zero or two

326
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
we have each dough will have zero or two
 

327
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,790
we have each dough will have zero or two
children okay does it make sense yeah

328
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,800
children okay does it make sense yeah
 

329
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,749
children okay does it make sense yeah
okay so

330
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
okay so
 

331
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,790
okay so

00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
y n equals num beginning we
 

377
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,230
y n equals num beginning we
we haven't found it yeah right because

378
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
we haven't found it yeah right because
 

379

if root

384
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
if root
 

385
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,309
if root
top value is

386
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
top value is
 

387
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,230

390
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
what should we do if you found a root if
 

391
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,830
what should we do if you found a root if
come and do this everything we return

392
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840

00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
so so the area is bigger than the
 

407
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,150
so so the area is bigger than the
current root

408
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
current root
 

409
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,670
current root
so look this is 0.5

410
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
so look this is 0.5
 

411
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,909
so look this is 0.5
you are looking for eric eight yeah so a

412

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
is bigger than three point five so what
 

415
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,670

419
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,070
we gotta take that right yeah so
how do we go to the right e root

420
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
how do we go to the right e root
 

421
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,909
how do we go to the right e root
equals root

422
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919

 

423
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,070

00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
except that we are returning y and not
 

501
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,829
except that we are returning y and not
returning area here right

502
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
returning area here right
 

503
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,550
returning area here right
right we are returning by look if you

504
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
right we are returning by look if you
 

505
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,829
right we are returning by look if you
get rid of these

506
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
get rid of these
 

507
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,150
get rid of these
returns then it's the same it's

508
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
returns then it's the same it's
 

509
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,590
returns then it's the same it's
basically the same as searching a note

510
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600
basically the same as searching a note
 

511
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,110
basically the same as searching a note
in the final research

512
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
in the final research
 

513
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,750
in the final research
search but we are retaining the parent

514
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
search but we are retaining the parent
 

515
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,350
search but we are retaining the parent
and the ryan's though okay

516
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
and the ryan's though okay
 

517
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,230
and the ryan's though okay
so how how do we update ryan snow every

518
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
so how how do we update ryan snow every
 

519
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,430
so how how do we update ryan snow every
time we go to the left

520
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
time we go to the left
 

521
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,750
time we go to the left
we update the ryan snow on the right

522
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
we update the ryan snow on the right
 

523
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,750
we update the ryan snow on the right
every time we go to the right we update

524
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
every time we go to the right we update
 

525
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,310
every time we go to the right we update
the

526
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
the
 

527
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,269
the
lines on the left yeah yeah okay can we

528
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
lines on the left yeah yeah okay can we
 

529
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:29,829
lines on the left yeah yeah okay can we
do this

530
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
do this
 

531
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,870
do this
using the recursion

532
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:32,880
using the recursion
 

533
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,949
using the recursion
cache no no no

534
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
cache no no no
 

535
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,150
cache no no no
let's do it

536
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160

 

537
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:59,269

let's do this

538
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279

 

539
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,990

okay let's do a search function here

540
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
okay let's do a search function here
 

541
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,910
okay let's do a search function here
define

542
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
define
 

543
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,190
define
look a fine and then let's add one more

544
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
look a fine and then let's add one more
 

545
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,230
look a fine and then let's add one more
parameter here right

546
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
parameter here right
 

547
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,829
parameter here right
because we need to know past the

548
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
because we need to know past the
 

549
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,949
because we need to know past the
sequence okay so let's play root

550
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959

 

551
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,230

uh we are finding the right end and

552
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
uh we are finding the right end and
 

553
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,110
uh we are finding the right end and
we are passing the sibling which is okay

554
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
we are passing the sibling which is okay
 

555
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,829
we are passing the sibling which is okay
yeah

556
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
yeah
 

557
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:36,629
yeah
correct

558
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639

 

559
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,990

with the ryan and eric okay everything

560
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
with the ryan and eric okay everything
 

561
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,350
with the ryan and eric okay everything
is the sibling okay

562
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360

 

563
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,509

this is the current sibling we are

564
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
this is the current sibling we are
 

565
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,790
this is the current sibling we are
looking we are returning

566
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800

 

567
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,230

okay look look if

568
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
okay look look if
 

569
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,470
okay look look if
karen root is if caroline is right and

570
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
karen root is if caroline is right and
 

571
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,430
karen root is if caroline is right and
what should we do

572
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
what should we do
 

573
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,150
what should we do
if carolina is generic well done whoa

574
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
if carolina is generic well done whoa
 

575
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,870
if carolina is generic well done whoa
that's great

576
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
that's great
 

577
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,389
that's great
yeah listen yeah okay that's good

578
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
yeah listen yeah okay that's good
 

579
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,269
yeah listen yeah okay that's good
all right now look if loot

580
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
all right now look if loot
 

581
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,389
all right now look if loot
okay let's say if lower equals

582
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
okay let's say if lower equals
 

583
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,509
okay let's say if lower equals
let's let's

584
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519

 

585
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,829

look the value is smaller than lion

586
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839

 

587
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,389

no if it's smaller than ryan look if

588
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
no if it's smaller than ryan look if
 

589
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,910
no if it's smaller than ryan look if
ryan is bigger than the root

590
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:25,920
ryan is bigger than the root
 

591
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,509
ryan is bigger than the root
somewhere where is the lion when ryan is

592
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
somewhere where is the lion when ryan is
 

593
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,509
somewhere where is the lion when ryan is
in the right tree or rough street

594
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
in the right tree or rough street
 

595
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,030
in the right tree or rough street
remember left

596
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
remember left
 

597
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,230
remember left
look this is the root right and then

598
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
look this is the root right and then
 

599
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,870
look this is the root right and then
ryan is bigger than note so it's in one

600
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
ryan is bigger than note so it's in one
 

601
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,990
ryan is bigger than note so it's in one
right yeah yeah

602
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
right yeah yeah
 

603
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,670
right yeah yeah
and we can look return return fine

604
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
and we can look return return fine
 

605
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,030
and we can look return return fine
every and then we do this or what

606
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
every and then we do this or what
 

607
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,150
every and then we do this or what
don't lie i know he's still passing the

608
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
don't lie i know he's still passing the
 

609
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,389
don't lie i know he's still passing the
lion

610
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399
lion
 

611
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,550
lion
and then what's going passing here right

612
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
and then what's going passing here right
 

613
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,870
and then what's going passing here right
now do the left right

691
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,189

smaller than wire

692
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
smaller than wire
 

693
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,550
smaller than wire
do this

694
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560

 

695
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,710

do this to this okay there are two here

696
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
do this to this okay there are two here
 

697
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,870
do this to this okay there are two here
two things can you read it

698
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
two things can you read it
 

699
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,230
two things can you read it
uh something with something

700
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
uh something with something
 

701
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,670
uh something with something
we did yeah i can write one for you if

702
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
we did yeah i can write one for you if
 

703
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,389
we did yeah i can write one for you if
blue

704
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
blue
 

705
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,910
blue
and white smaller and y and then every

706
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
and white smaller and y and then every
 

707
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,189
and white smaller and y and then every
would be equals what

708
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
would be equals what
 

709
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,269
would be equals what
the line is more longer than that yeah

710
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
the line is more longer than that yeah
 

711
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,150
the line is more longer than that yeah
yeah i know don't what

712
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
yeah i know don't what
 

713
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,269
yeah i know don't what
and then that's all right ryan is bigger

714
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
and then that's all right ryan is bigger
 

715
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,949
and then that's all right ryan is bigger
than the loot so ryan is on the right

716
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
than the loot so ryan is on the right
 

717
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,150
than the loot so ryan is on the right
hand side so every

718
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
hand side so every
 

719
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,069
hand side so every
left hand side and then what should we

720
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079
left hand side and then what should we
 

721
00:16:46,079 --> 00:17:14,390
left hand side and then what should we
do here

722
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:14,400

 

723
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,870

and then we possibly can return

724
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
and then we possibly can return
 

725
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:26,789
and then we possibly can return
everything

726
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799

 

727
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,029

here because it's none right if ryan is

728
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
here because it's none right if ryan is
 

729
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,630
here because it's none right if ryan is
not found and then this

730
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
not found and then this
 

731
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,789
not found and then this
this loop will be ended and then we'll

732
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
this loop will be ended and then we'll
 

733
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,310
this loop will be ended and then we'll
return eric

734
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
return eric
 

735
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,630
return eric
right does that make sense oh written

736
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640
right does that make sense oh written
 

737
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,909
right does that make sense oh written
down i think it will be written now

738
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
down i think it will be written now
 

739
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,710
down i think it will be written now
which is better

740
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
which is better
 

741
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,350
which is better
written now because if ryan is not found

742
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
written now because if ryan is not found
 

743
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,110
written now because if ryan is not found
we return now it means that

744
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
we return now it means that
 

745
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,789
we return now it means that
the brother of writing is not there

746
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
the brother of writing is not there
 

747
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,310
the brother of writing is not there
right yeah

748
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
right yeah
 

749
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,950
right yeah
okay what's the time complexity oh logan

750
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
okay what's the time complexity oh logan
 

751
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,830
okay what's the time complexity oh logan
what's the space complexity

752
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
what's the space complexity
 

753
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,590
what's the space complexity
log end no no do we use the extra space

754
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
log end no no do we use the extra space
 

755
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,230
log end no no do we use the extra space
here

756
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
here
 

757
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,150
