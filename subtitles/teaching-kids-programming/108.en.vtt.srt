00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,909

hello hello hello mr eric mr ryan how

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:03,919
hello hello hello mr eric mr ryan how
 

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,510
hello hello hello mr eric mr ryan how
are you today

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:05,520
are you today
 

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,070
are you today
okay so today we're going to talk about

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
okay so today we're going to talk about
 

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,150
okay so today we're going to talk about
an interesting subject which is called

8
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,160
an interesting subject which is called
 

9
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,749
an interesting subject which is called
longest

10
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:11,759
longest
 

11
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,270
longest
increasing

12
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,280

 

13
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,189

how do subsequence know subsequently

14
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
how do subsequence know subsequently
 

15
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,109
how do subsequence know subsequently
we've watched this video

16
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
we've watched this video
 

17
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,710
we've watched this video
before yeah okay so let's let's

18
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
before yeah okay so let's let's
 

19
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,269
before yeah okay so let's let's
do an example uh do you understand

20
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
do an example uh do you understand
 

21
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,429
do an example uh do you understand
what's the subsequence

22
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:27,439
what's the subsequence
 

23
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,470
what's the subsequence
uh you take none or more

24
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
uh you take none or more
 

25
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,030
uh you take none or more
okay so for example eric e-r-i-c what's

26
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
okay so for example eric e-r-i-c what's
 

27
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,229
okay so for example eric e-r-i-c what's
the subsequence can you

28
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
the subsequence can you
 

29
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,190
the subsequence can you
this is a few subsequences of the eric

30
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
this is a few subsequences of the eric
 

31
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,030
this is a few subsequences of the eric
rick

32
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
rick
 

33
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,990
rick
sorry rick rick yeah

34
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,000

 

35
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,229

even eric is the subsequence of eric

36
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
even eric is the subsequence of eric
 

37
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,270
even eric is the subsequence of eric
yeah because you're

38
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280
yeah because you're
 

39
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,830
yeah because you're
not allowed to take nothing yeah and

40
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
not allowed to take nothing yeah and
 

41
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,790
not allowed to take nothing yeah and
ryan

42
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
ryan
 

43
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:06,789
ryan
what's the subsequent yeah

44
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799

 

45
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,789

basically you are allowed to erase

46
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
basically you are allowed to erase
 

47
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,910
basically you are allowed to erase
nothing or erase

48
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
nothing or erase
 

49
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,670
nothing or erase
anything or you can erase uh o

50
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
anything or you can erase uh o
 

51
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,950
anything or you can erase uh o
so empty string is a subsequence of ryan

52
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
so empty string is a subsequence of ryan
 

53
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,830
so empty string is a subsequence of ryan
okay in technically okay yeah yeah

54
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
okay in technically okay yeah yeah
 

55
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,270
okay in technically okay yeah yeah
okay given an array

56
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
okay given an array
 

57
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,830
okay given an array
with numbers integers yes let's say 0

58
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
with numbers integers yes let's say 0
 

59
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,030
with numbers integers yes let's say 0
9 8 10

60
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
9 8 10

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,870
9 8 10
2 4 5

62
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
2 4 5
 

63
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,429
2 4 5
what's the longest subsequence

64
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439

 

65
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,990

um zero eight ten yeah

66
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000

 

67
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,020

sorry zero three four five one two four

68
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,030
sorry zero three four five one two four
 

69
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:06,709
sorry zero three four five one two four
[Music]

70
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:06,719

 

71
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,630

no because when you pick nine you can't

72
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
no because when you pick nine you can't
 

73
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,309
no because when you pick nine you can't
pick a because this is not increasing

74
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
pick a because this is not increasing
 

75
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,430
pick a because this is not increasing
this is decreasing

76
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
this is decreasing
 

77
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,589
this is decreasing
yeah got it so it's always increasing

78
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
yeah got it so it's always increasing
 

79
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,470
yeah got it so it's always increasing
zero two four

80
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
zero two four
 

81
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,589
zero two four
five right so therefore so our task

82
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
five right so therefore so our task
 

83
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,150
five right so therefore so our task
is to find the longest to count the

84
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
is to find the longest to count the
 

85
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,190
is to find the longest to count the
number of longest

86
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
number of longest
 

87
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,350
number of longest
longest increasing subsequence so that

88
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
longest increasing subsequence so that
 

89
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,630
longest increasing subsequence so that
will be the four numbers

90
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
will be the four numbers
 

91
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,309
will be the four numbers
one thing yeah right one

92
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
one thing yeah right one
 

93
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,630
one thing yeah right one
yeah look at it so the longest

94
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
yeah look at it so the longest
 

95
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,670
yeah look at it so the longest
subsequent will be four

96
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
subsequent will be four
 

97
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,630
subsequent will be four
four elements okay yeah so had any idea

98
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
four elements okay yeah so had any idea
 

99
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,229
four elements okay yeah so had any idea
how are we solving this problem just

100
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
how are we solving this problem just
 

101
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,110
how are we solving this problem just
mine

102
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
mine
 

103
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,790
mine
the longest subsequent so yes how how

104
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
the longest subsequent so yes how how
 

105
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,750
the longest subsequent so yes how how
are we doing this

106
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
are we doing this
 

107
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,470
are we doing this
any ideas just think about it how are we

108
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
any ideas just think about it how are we
 

109
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,830
any ideas just think about it how are we
doing

110
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840

 

111
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,710

sorry nothing

112
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
sorry nothing
 

113
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,750
sorry nothing
any idea how we're so good wait moving

114
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
any idea how we're so good wait moving
 

115
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,509
any idea how we're so good wait moving
brute forcing yeah that's a good source

116
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
brute forcing yeah that's a good source
 

117
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,509
brute forcing yeah that's a good source
how how are we going to prove our sins

118
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
how how are we going to prove our sins
 

119
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,710
how how are we going to prove our sins
so we find out every possibility of the

120
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
so we find out every possibility of the
 

121
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,509
so we find out every possibility of the
subsequence

122
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
subsequence
 

123
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,949
subsequence
right and then phi is is increasing

124
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
right and then phi is is increasing
 

125
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,750
right and then phi is is increasing
right

126
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
right
 

127
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,670
right
yes yes so remember the subsequence the

128
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
yes yes so remember the subsequence the
 

129
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,270
yes yes so remember the subsequence the
time complexity of choosing that

130
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
time complexity of choosing that
 

131
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,710
time complexity of choosing that
that subsequent is

132
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
that subsequent is
 

133
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,229
that subsequent is
for example like let's say a b how many

134
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
for example like let's say a b how many
 

135
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,430
for example like let's say a b how many
subsequent

136
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
subsequent
 

137
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,190
subsequent
you can pick from two numbers to

138
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
you can pick from two numbers to
 

139
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,390
you can pick from two numbers to
two characters four four yeah

140
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
two characters four four yeah
 

141
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,110
two characters four four yeah
how about abc

142
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120

 

143
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,110

how many how many possible subsequence

144
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
how many how many possible subsequence
 

145
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,229
how many how many possible subsequence
of abc three three letters

146
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
of abc three three letters
 

147
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,630
of abc three three letters
two is four yes that's right two is four

148
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
two is four yes that's right two is four
 

149
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,149
two is four yes that's right two is four
one is one two right

150
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
one is one two right
 

151
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,550
one is one two right
because you can pick or not pick right

152
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
because you can pick or not pick right
 

153
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,509
because you can pick or not pick right
two is four

154
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
two is four
 

155
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,789
two is four
yeah and three is one six

156
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
yeah and three is one six
 

157
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,229
yeah and three is one six
how is that six

158
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
how is that six
 

159
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,429
how is that six
abc a b c a

160
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
abc a b c a
 

161
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,550
abc a b c a
b a c b c

162
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
b a c b c
 

163
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,830
b a c b c
and what a b c so it's more than six

164
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
and what a b c so it's more than six
 

165
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,789
and what a b c so it's more than six
right

166
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
right
 

167
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,949
right
it's already seven yeah and then you can

168
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
it's already seven yeah and then you can
 

169
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,869
it's already seven yeah and then you can
pick nothing

170
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
pick nothing
 

171
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,909
pick nothing
yeah eight eight yeah so then you get it

172
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
yeah eight eight yeah so then you get it
 

173
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:18,870
yeah eight eight yeah so then you get it
and four

174
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
and four
 

175
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,310
and four
do you want me to tell you

176
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320

 

177
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,590

wait come on two four eight

178
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
wait come on two four eight
 

179
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,350
wait come on two four eight
what's next

180
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360

 

181
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,189

why this is the total number of the

182
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
why this is the total number of the
 

183
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,790
why this is the total number of the
subsequence

184
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
subsequence
 

185
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,870
subsequence
and elements because for each one

186
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
and elements because for each one
 

187
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,990
and elements because for each one
you can choose to pick or don't pick

188
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
you can choose to pick or don't pick
 

189
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,310
you can choose to pick or don't pick
in the subsequence right yeah so for

190
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
in the subsequence right yeah so for
 

191
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,350
in the subsequence right yeah so for
each letter

192
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
each letter
 

193
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,550
each letter
how many possibilities how many

194
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
how many possibilities how many
 

195
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,430
how many possibilities how many
possibilities

196
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
possibilities
 

197
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,070
possibilities
for each one so you pick or not pick how

198
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
for each one so you pick or not pick how
 

199
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,950
for each one so you pick or not pick how
many possibilities eric

200
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960

 

201
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,990

how many possibilities for a i want to

202
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
how many possibilities for a i want to
 

203
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,029
how many possibilities for a i want to
pick up nothing how many possibilities

204
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039

 

205
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,550

two i want to take on p how many two

206
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
two i want to take on p how many two
 

207
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,870
two i want to take on p how many two
so it's two times two times two how many

208
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
so it's two times two times two how many
 

209
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,830
so it's two times two times two how many
how many n

210
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
how many n
 

211
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,029
how many n
times so two to the power of n right

212
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
times so two to the power of n right
 

213
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,029
times so two to the power of n right
yeah so that's the total number of

214
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
yeah so that's the total number of
 

215
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,150
yeah so that's the total number of
subsequence yeah

216
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
subsequence yeah
 

217
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,230
subsequence yeah
yeah in other way in other ways because

218
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
yeah in other way in other ways because
 

219
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,790
yeah in other way in other ways because
because n numbers yeah so the

220
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
because n numbers yeah so the
 

221
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,390
because n numbers yeah so the
subsequence could be

222
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
subsequence could be
 

223
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,469
subsequence could be
length yellow could be length one could

224
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
length yellow could be length one could
 

225
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,550
length yellow could be length one could
be length two to be length three right

226
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
be length two to be length three right
 

227
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,550
be length two to be length three right
yeah and then do you still remember the

228
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
yeah and then do you still remember the
 

229
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,150
yeah and then do you still remember the
combination yeah if c

230
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
combination yeah if c
 

231
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,749
combination yeah if c
and zero mean takes nothing

232
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
and zero mean takes nothing
 

233
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,270
and zero mean takes nothing
out of n items and then picks one thing

234
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
out of n items and then picks one thing
 

235
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,310
out of n items and then picks one thing
out of entire items picks two things out

236
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
out of entire items picks two things out
 

237
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,230
out of entire items picks two things out
of anti-items and

238
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
of anti-items and
 

239
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,390
of anti-items and
picks anything out of an item yeah

240
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
picks anything out of an item yeah
 

241
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,990
picks anything out of an item yeah
because that's only one possibility

242
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
because that's only one possibility
 

243
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,909
because that's only one possibility
this is only one percentage if you add

244
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
this is only one percentage if you add
 

245
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,909
this is only one percentage if you add
it add all these what's the total number

246
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
it add all these what's the total number
 

247
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,629
it add all these what's the total number

subsequence
 

289
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,670

yeah we're done so so the overall time

290
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
yeah we're done so so the overall time
 

291
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,629
yeah we're done so so the overall time
complexity is

o to n times n yeah
 

295
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,950
o to n times n yeah
this is very huge this is highly complex

296
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
this is very huge this is highly complex
 

297
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,790
this is very huge this is highly complex
so it's not feasible to solve using the

298
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
so it's not feasible to solve using the
 

299
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,230
so it's not feasible to solve using the
computers okay

300
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
computers okay
 

301
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,950
computers okay
yeah if n is 100 2 to the power 100 is

302
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
yeah if n is 100 2 to the power 100 is
 

303
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,150
yeah if n is 100 2 to the power 100 is
is huge you know

304
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,160
is huge you know
 

305
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,150
is huge you know
okay so uh sure we need to find

306
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
okay so uh sure we need to find
 

307
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,270
okay so uh sure we need to find
a better agreement so so how about i

308
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
a better agreement so so how about i
 

309
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,029
a better agreement so so how about i
tell you that this problem we can solve

310
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
tell you that this problem we can solve
 

311
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,790
tell you that this problem we can solve
it using dynamic programming so what's

312
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
it using dynamic programming so what's
 

313
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,070
it using dynamic programming so what's
dynamic programming can you tell me

314
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
dynamic programming can you tell me
 

315
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,670
dynamic programming can you tell me
remember

316
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
remember
 

317
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,749
remember
yeah the key thing is remembering one

318
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
yeah the key thing is remembering one
 

319
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,670
yeah the key thing is remembering one
other thing remember

320
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
other thing remember
 

321
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,230
other thing remember
yeah that's even better remembering is

322
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
yeah that's even better remembering is
 

323
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,950
yeah that's even better remembering is
is the

324
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
is the
 

325
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,270
is the
common word but the minimization is the

326
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
common word but the minimization is the
 

327
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,950
common word but the minimization is the
technical word okay

328
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
technical word okay
 

329
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,150
technical word okay
mean minimization it sounds quite

330
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
mean minimization it sounds quite
 

331
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,430
mean minimization it sounds quite
funny yeah it's very similar to

332
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
funny yeah it's very similar to
 

333
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,589
funny yeah it's very similar to
memorized but it's mean mobilization

334
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
memorized but it's mean mobilization
 

335
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,749
memorized but it's mean mobilization
mimo what's mimo

336
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
mimo what's mimo
 

337
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,110
mimo what's mimo
mimei it's mimo mimo

338
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
mimei it's mimo mimo
 

339
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,589
mimei it's mimo mimo
it's like a notebook you put the notes

340
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
it's like a notebook you put the notes
 

341
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,110
it's like a notebook you put the notes
in there it's like you're

342
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
in there it's like you're
 

343
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,830
in there it's like you're
fish name no okay

344
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
fish name no okay
 

345
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,070
fish name no okay
so

346
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080

 

347
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,070

so dynamic programming we are

348
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
so dynamic programming we are
 

349
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,150
so dynamic programming we are
remembering how about if i tell you that

350
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
remembering how about if i tell you that
 

351
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,189
remembering how about if i tell you that
f n okay f

352
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
f n okay f
 

353
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,230
f n okay f
n is the we story f n

354
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
n is the we story f n
 

355
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,909
n is the we story f n
is the longest subsequence the ends and

356
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
is the longest subsequence the ends and
 

357
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,909
is the longest subsequence the ends and
ends ends number so f

358
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
ends ends number so f
 

359
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,589
ends ends number so f
two what does f2 mean

360
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
two what does f2 mean
 

361
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,869
two what does f2 mean
zero one two so it means that f2 means

362
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
zero one two so it means that f2 means
 

363
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,990
zero one two so it means that f2 means
the longest

364
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
the longest
 

365
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,629
the longest
number of subsequence increasing

366
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
number of subsequence increasing
 

367
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,350
number of subsequence increasing
subsequence

368
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
subsequence
 

369
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,750
subsequence
that the last number is eight yeah okay

370
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
that the last number is eight yeah okay
 

371
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,110
that the last number is eight yeah okay
okay so now if i know f2 is f2

372
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
okay so now if i know f2 is f2
 

373
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,550
okay so now if i know f2 is f2
i i don't f2 okay and then

374
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
i i don't f2 okay and then
 

375
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,350
i i don't f2 okay and then
here look because a is smaller than 10

376
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
here look because a is smaller than 10
 

377
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,149
here look because a is smaller than 10
so what does

378
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
so what does
 

379
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,550
so what does
f3 equal what does s3 equal

380
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
f3 equal what does s3 equal
 

381
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,910
f3 equal what does s3 equal
f2 i give you we currently don't care

382
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:51,920
f2 i give you we currently don't care
 

383
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,670
f2 i give you we currently don't care
about its value but i know

384
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:53,680
about its value but i know
 

385
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,710
about its value but i know
a is smaller than 10 yeah and then

386
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
a is smaller than 10 yeah and then
 

387
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,269
a is smaller than 10 yeah and then
f3 is f2 what

388
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
f3 is f2 what
 

389
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,310
f3 is f2 what
you see this is the f2 is nothing

390
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
you see this is the f2 is nothing
 

391
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,870
you see this is the f2 is nothing
there may be a minion items before a

392
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
there may be a minion items before a
 

393
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,509
there may be a minion items before a
yeah

394
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
yeah
 

395
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,230
yeah
but i tell you the number of longest

396
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
but i tell you the number of longest
 

397
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,990
but i tell you the number of longest
increasing subsequence that the last

398
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
increasing subsequence that the last
 

399
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,550
increasing subsequence that the last
number is

400
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
number is
 

401
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,070
number is
a is f2 and then now you know

402
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
a is f2 and then now you know
 

403
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,790
a is f2 and then now you know
a is more than 10 so what does it mean

404
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
a is more than 10 so what does it mean
 

405
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,790
a is more than 10 so what does it mean
for f3

406
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
for f3
 

407
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,310
for f3
10 sorry now s3 is the number of the

408
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
10 sorry now s3 is the number of the
 

409
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,949
10 sorry now s3 is the number of the
longest

410
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
longest
 

411
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,150
longest
increasing subsequence that ends and 10

412
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
increasing subsequence that ends and 10
 

413
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,269
increasing subsequence that ends and 10
yeah and then now i tell you f2 is

414
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
yeah and then now i tell you f2 is
 

415
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,670
yeah and then now i tell you f2 is
after the value is calculated we already

416
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
after the value is calculated we already
 

417
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,430
after the value is calculated we already
know we're already memorizing

418
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
know we're already memorizing
 

419
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,110
know we're already memorizing
using the dynamic programming

420
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
using the dynamic programming
 

421
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,630
using the dynamic programming
minimization

422
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
minimization
 

423
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,870
minimization
and then i tell you a is smaller than

424
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
and then i tell you a is smaller than
 

425
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,910
and then i tell you a is smaller than
10.

426
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
10.
 

427
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,430
10.
so what happens if we i add a 10 in the

428
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
so what happens if we i add a 10 in the
 

429
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,269
so what happens if we i add a 10 in the
longest subsequence does this feel valid

430
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
longest subsequence does this feel valid
 

431
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,430
longest subsequence does this feel valid
yeah because look at the last number

432
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
yeah because look at the last number
 

433
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,190
yeah because look at the last number
ending in a

434
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
ending in a
 

435
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,230
ending in a
yeah it could be 1 3 4 a

436
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
yeah it could be 1 3 4 a
 

437
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,630
yeah it could be 1 3 4 a
this is a subsequence previously yeah

438
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
this is a subsequence previously yeah
 

439
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,350
this is a subsequence previously yeah
you don't care

440
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
you don't care
 

441
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,670
you don't care
and now you know a is smaller than 10.

442
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
and now you know a is smaller than 10.
 

443
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,470
and now you know a is smaller than 10.
what happens if i put a 10 here

444
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
what happens if i put a 10 here
 

445
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,389
what happens if i put a 10 here
what happens if i put a 10 here does it

446
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
what happens if i put a 10 here does it
 

447
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,750
what happens if i put a 10 here does it
still make a longer one

448
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
still make a longer one
 

449
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,630
still make a longer one
does it make sense do you get it

450
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
does it make sense do you get it
 

451
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,750
does it make sense do you get it
so f2 equals f2

452
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
so f2 equals f2
 

453
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,150
so f2 equals f2
f3 equals 1 f2

454
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160

 

455
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,550

i put the 10 in the end it's the longest

456
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
i put the 10 in the end it's the longest
 

457
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,310
i put the 10 in the end it's the longest
subsequent it's still

458
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
subsequent it's still
 

459
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,550
subsequent it's still
increasing something yes i won that's

460
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
increasing something yes i won that's
 

461
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,630
increasing something yes i won that's
that's what i meant okay

462
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
that's what i meant okay
 

463
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,230
that's what i meant okay
you get it that's one ad yeah and one

464
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
you get it that's one ad yeah and one
 

465
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,470
you get it that's one ad yeah and one
you have one edit do you understand yeah

466
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
you have one edit do you understand yeah
 

467
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,509
you have one edit do you understand yeah
yeah

468
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
yeah
 

469
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,550
yeah
and do you see because we we

470
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
and do you see because we we
 

471
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,190
and do you see because we we
already know this bit and we can reuse

472
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
already know this bit and we can reuse
 

473
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,150
already know this bit and we can reuse
it

474
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
it
 

475
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,190
it
yeah why can't we reuse it because a

476
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
yeah why can't we reuse it because a
 

477
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,710
yeah why can't we reuse it because a
is smaller than 10 yeah and b speed

478
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
is smaller than 10 yeah and b speed
 

479
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,069
is smaller than 10 yeah and b speed
for example a minion if f f2

480
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
for example a minion if f f2
 

481
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,350
for example a minion if f f2
is a minion and then i know f3

482
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
is a minion and then i know f3
 

483
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,350
is a minion and then i know f3
is a medium plus one because i can

484
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
is a medium plus one because i can
 

485
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,949
is a medium plus one because i can

to check
every number between 0 to 3.

502
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
every number between 0 to 3.
 

503
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,670
every number between 0 to 3.
look i want to check every number

504
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
look i want to check every number
 

505
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,030
look i want to check every number
between these

506
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
between these
 

507
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,190
between these
and i check if 0 is more than 10 if it's

508
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
and i check if 0 is more than 10 if it's
 

509
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,829
and i check if 0 is more than 10 if it's
smaller than 10 then f3 equals

510
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
smaller than 10 then f3 equals
 

511
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,110
smaller than 10 then f3 equals
1 plus f0 but i want to get a maximum

512
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
1 plus f0 but i want to get a maximum
 

513
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,630
1 plus f0 but i want to get a maximum
of these okay and then 9 is smaller than

514
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
of these okay and then 9 is smaller than
 

515
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,030
of these okay and then 9 is smaller than
10

516
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
10
 

517
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,550
10
yes then 1 plus one a is smaller than

518
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
yes then 1 plus one a is smaller than
 

519
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,030
yes then 1 plus one a is smaller than
ten

520
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
ten
 

521
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,430
ten
yeah a f two plus and plus one actually

522
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
yeah a f two plus and plus one actually
 

523
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,550
yeah a f two plus and plus one actually
okay do you understand yes

524
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
okay do you understand yes
 

525
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,509
okay do you understand yes
yeah kind of maybe it's better if i

526
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
yeah kind of maybe it's better if i
 

527
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,310
yeah kind of maybe it's better if i
write a code than you will see

528
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
write a code than you will see
 

529
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,269
write a code than you will see
you'll see how it works okay let's say

530
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
you'll see how it works okay let's say
 

531
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,710
you'll see how it works okay let's say
define

532
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
define
 

533
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,829
define
remember the top down and primary

534
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
remember the top down and primary
 

535
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,750
remember the top down and primary
programming yeah that's two approaches

536
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
programming yeah that's two approaches
 

537
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,230
programming yeah that's two approaches
what's top-down dynamic programming

538
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
what's top-down dynamic programming
 

539
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,590
what's top-down dynamic programming
usually implemented

540
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
usually implemented
 

541
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,670
usually implemented
in what top down if i want to calculate

542
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
in what top down if i want to calculate
 

543
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,430
in what top down if i want to calculate
fibonacci number every time i like talk

544
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
fibonacci number every time i like talk
 

545
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,790
fibonacci number every time i like talk
about people naturally if i want to

546
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
about people naturally if i want to
 

547
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,590
about people naturally if i want to
calculate

548
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
calculate
 

549
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,470
calculate
the f 100 fibonacci number what do you

550
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
the f 100 fibonacci number what do you
 

551
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,110
the f 100 fibonacci number what do you
need to know

552
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
need to know
 

553
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,870
need to know
to calculate f 100 you need to know f

554
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
to calculate f 100 you need to know f
 

555
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,069
to calculate f 100 you need to know f
99 and f

556
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
99 and f
 

557
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,069
99 and f
98 because it's the sum of previous two

558
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
98 because it's the sum of previous two
 

559
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,389
98 because it's the sum of previous two
right yeah

560
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399
right yeah
 

561
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,509
right yeah
okay so the fibonacci number f99 and f8

562
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
okay so the fibonacci number f99 and f8
 

563
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,030
okay so the fibonacci number f99 and f8
98 so so this is top down because i want

564
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
98 so so this is top down because i want
 

565
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,790
98 so so this is top down because i want
to calculate f100

566
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
to calculate f100
 

567
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,990
to calculate f100
i i need to recursively call it

568
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
i i need to recursively call it
 

569
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,910
i i need to recursively call it
yeah yeah i i need to because the

570
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
yeah yeah i i need to because the
 

571
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,670
yeah yeah i i need to because the
recording f9

572
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
recording f9
 

573
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,389
recording f9
and f98 am right and the bottom of

574
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399
and f98 am right and the bottom of
 

575
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,069
and f98 am right and the bottom of
dynamic performance what's that if i

576
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
dynamic performance what's that if i
 

577
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,069
dynamic performance what's that if i
want to calculate every 100

578
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
want to calculate every 100
 

579
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,550
want to calculate every 100
where do i need to calculate first the

580
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
where do i need to calculate first the
 

581
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,949
where do i need to calculate first the
butter up

582
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:58,959
butter up
 

583
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,389
butter up
you need to calculate from

584
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
you need to calculate from
 

585
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,949
you need to calculate from
the other direction what's the already

586
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959

 

587
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,230

where is the first value i need to

588
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
where is the first value i need to
 

589
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,470
where is the first value i need to
calculate

590
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480

 

591
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,470

where's the first value e

592
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480
where's the first value e
 

593
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,790
where's the first value e
for what i mean

594
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
for what i mean
 

595
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,389
for what i mean
no i want to test f n if top top down

596
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
no i want to test f n if top top down
 

597
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,829
no i want to test f n if top top down
is i f n minus one

598
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
is i f n minus one
 

599
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,990
is i f n minus one
plus f n minus two okay this is called

600
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
plus f n minus two okay this is called
 

601
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,750
plus f n minus two okay this is called
top down because i start with

602
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,760
top down because i start with
 

603
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,949
top down because i start with
n and going down and if i want to

604
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
n and going down and if i want to
 

605
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,550
n and going down and if i want to
do it butter up i need to study what

606
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
do it butter up i need to study what
 

607
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,389
do it butter up i need to study what
study this direction

608
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399

 

609
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,030

come on end up end to zero and what's

610
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
come on end up end to zero and what's
 

611
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,269
come on end up end to zero and what's
this

612
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
this
 

613
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,910
this
and and i want to start calculating yeah

614
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
and and i want to start calculating yeah
 

615
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,230
and and i want to start calculating yeah
so i need to calculate f0 f1

616
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
so i need to calculate f0 f1
 

617
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,110
so i need to calculate f0 f1
and using these two values with f2 right

618
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
and using these two values with f2 right
 

619
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,069
and using these two values with f2 right
this is called

620
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
this is called
 

621
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,670
this is called
do you understand different direction

622
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
do you understand different direction
 

623
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,269
do you understand different direction
yeah basically it's the same thing yeah

624
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
yeah basically it's the same thing yeah
 

625
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,509
yeah basically it's the same thing yeah
okay so look define f and

626
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:09,519
okay so look define f and
 

627
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,949
okay so look define f and
f n okay so look fn is the longest

628
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
f n okay so look fn is the longest
 

629
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,310
f n okay so look fn is the longest
number longest increasing subsequence

630
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
number longest increasing subsequence
 

631
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,629
number longest increasing subsequence
of the uh of the nth number okay

632
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
of the uh of the nth number okay
 

633
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,470
of the uh of the nth number okay
yeah okay okay so yeah

634
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
yeah okay okay so yeah
 

635
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,949
yeah okay okay so yeah
must equal something yeah yeah

636
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
must equal something yeah yeah
 

637
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,230
must equal something yeah yeah
so look the longest subsequence the

638
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
so look the longest subsequence the
 

639
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,750
so look the longest subsequence the
minimum value is what

640
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
minimum value is what
 

641
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,110
minimum value is what
is is if i have only one value what's

642
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
is is if i have only one value what's
 

643
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,430
is is if i have only one value what's
the

644
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
the
 

645
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,790
the
longest increasing subsequence one for

646
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
longest increasing subsequence one for
 

647
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,910
longest increasing subsequence one for
example if i one

648
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
example if i one
 

649
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,750
example if i one
yeah because it's one value it's

650
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
yeah because it's one value it's
 

651
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,110
yeah because it's one value it's
increasing yeah

652
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
increasing yeah
 

653
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,030
increasing yeah
okay so if look then for

654
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
okay so if look then for
 

655
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,470
okay so if look then for
i in range i i need to

656
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
i in range i i need to
 

657
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,509
i in range i i need to
check the values up to n nth right so

658
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
check the values up to n nth right so
 

659
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,150
check the values up to n nth right so
let's put

660
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
let's put
 

661
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,150
let's put
n here look if everything look

662
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
n here look if everything look
 

663
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,949
n here look if everything look
numbers if numbers okay so suppose we

664
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
numbers if numbers okay so suppose we
 

665
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,310
numbers if numbers okay so suppose we
have numbers here okay

666
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
have numbers here okay
 

667
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,150
have numbers here okay
numbers i is smaller than number

668
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
numbers i is smaller than number
 

669
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,230
numbers i is smaller than number
that needs to be a profit j g

670
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
that needs to be a profit j g
 

671
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,150
that needs to be a profit j g
if i number smaller than

672
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
if i number smaller than
 

673
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,470
if i number smaller than
look answer equals max answer okay

674
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480

 

675
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,150

answer and what should i put here

676
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
answer and what should i put here
 

677
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,189
answer and what should i put here
no no no not yet f1

678
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
no no no not yet f1
 

679
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,710
no no no not yet f1
all right j j

680
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
all right j j
 

681
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,910
all right j j
there's no j i hear i invent

682
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:35,920
there's no j i hear i invent
 

683
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,550
there's no j i hear i invent
n if i look look at this remember

684
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:40,560
n if i look look at this remember
 

685
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,829
n if i look look at this remember
remember this is i this is i this is n

686
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
remember this is i this is i this is n
 

687
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,670
remember this is i this is i this is n
if this number is smaller than this

688
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
if this number is smaller than this
 

689
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,870
if this number is smaller than this
number

690
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
number
 

691
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,670
number
yeah and then what should we do answer

692
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
yeah and then what should we do answer
 

693
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,150
yeah and then what should we do answer
would be the maximum of

694
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
would be the maximum of
 

695
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,350
would be the maximum of
our f1 f1 we calling itself

696
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
our f1 f1 we calling itself
 

697
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,509
our f1 f1 we calling itself
f i yeah yeah and one

698
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
f i yeah yeah and one
 

699
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,870
f i yeah yeah and one
and one one and one and return one

700
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
and one one and one and return one
 

701
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,470
and one one and one and return one
answer yeah okay what's missing

702
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
answer yeah okay what's missing
 

703
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,990
answer yeah okay what's missing
yeah because if we're not using the

704
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
yeah because if we're not using the
 

705
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,110
yeah because if we're not using the
cache these will be exponential yeah

706
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
cache these will be exponential yeah
 

707
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,230
cache these will be exponential yeah
we need to for each fn we only calculate

708
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
we need to for each fn we only calculate
 

709
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,870
we need to for each fn we only calculate
it once

710
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
it once
 

711
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,509
it once
right yeah because next time we don't

712
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
right yeah because next time we don't
 

713
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,670
right yeah because next time we don't
need to calculate it

714
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
need to calculate it
 

715
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,110
need to calculate it
this is called what what dynamic

716
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
this is called what what dynamic
 

717
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,230
this is called what what dynamic
programming

718
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
programming
 

719
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,430
programming
top down or bottom up uh

720
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
top down or bottom up uh
 

721
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,829
top down or bottom up uh
top down top down okay yeah because we

722
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
top down top down okay yeah because we
 

723
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,189
top down top down okay yeah because we
take away fn and we

724
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
take away fn and we
 

725
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,790
take away fn and we
going with three

726
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
going with three
 

727
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,990
going with three
yeah we're calculating from i from f 0

728
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
yeah we're calculating from i from f 0
 

729
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,670
yeah we're calculating from i from f 0
to x 1. okay

730
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
to x 1. okay
 

731
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,150
to x 1. okay
yeah okay so now another one

732
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
yeah okay so now another one
 

733
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,110
yeah okay so now another one
another one and remember we can use that

734
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
another one and remember we can use that
 

735
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,829
another one and remember we can use that
we can

736
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
we can
 

737
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,509
we can
declare a notebook yeah without the

738
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:51,519
declare a notebook yeah without the
 

739
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,670
declare a notebook yeah without the
cache we can use this one

740
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
cache we can use this one
 

741
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,189
cache we can use this one
we can use a notebook passing as a

742
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
we can use a notebook passing as a
 

743
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,710
we can use a notebook passing as a
parameter if

744
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
parameter if
 

745
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,069
parameter if
if n in notebook return notebook n right

746
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
if n in notebook return notebook n right
 

747
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,069
if n in notebook return notebook n right
and before we return it we can store the

748
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
and before we return it we can store the
 

749
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,670
and before we return it we can store the
values in the

750
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
values in the
 

751
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,630
values in the
notebook okay something like notebook

752
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,640
notebook okay something like notebook
 

753
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,429
notebook okay something like notebook
and equals value

754
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
and equals value
 

755
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,990
and equals value
and return value yeah remember return

756
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
and return value yeah remember return
 

757
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,870
and return value yeah remember return
value yeah

758
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880

no book end right because look it you
 

773
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,710
no book end right because look it you
need to write this

774
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
need to write this
 

775
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,710
need to write this
like this and it's better we just get

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760
what's wrong with that no if no there's
 

803
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,350
what's wrong with that no if no there's
only one element in array what's the

804
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
only one element in array what's the
 

805
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,029
only one element in array what's the
longest subsequence

806
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
longest subsequence
 

807
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,590
longest subsequence
longer is increasing subsequent even

808
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
longer is increasing subsequent even
 

809
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,789

there's only number one
 

811
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,549
there's only number one
one one yeah one okay now we need to

812
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
one one yeah one okay now we need to
 

813
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,830
one one yeah one okay now we need to
store this

814
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
store this
 

815
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,669
store this
arrays in the dp values in an array

816
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
arrays in the dp values in an array
 

817
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,230
arrays in the dp values in an array
let's say dp equals beginning would be

818
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
let's say dp equals beginning would be
 

819
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,190
let's say dp equals beginning would be
one right

820
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
one right
 

821
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,310
one right
yeah because each value will be each

822
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
yeah because each value will be each
 

823
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,110
yeah because each value will be each
the longest increasing subsequence that

824
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
the longest increasing subsequence that
 

825
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,590
the longest increasing subsequence that
ends

826
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
ends
 

827
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,310
ends
at each number is at least one right

828
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
at each number is at least one right
 

829
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,270
at each number is at least one right
yeah

830
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
yeah
 

831
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,870
yeah
and right times n plus one okay

832
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
and right times n plus one okay
 

833
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,950
and right times n plus one okay
times n plus one okay then four

834
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960
times n plus one okay then four
 

835
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,669
times n plus one okay then four
i in range

836
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679

 

837
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,150

n right then we do another loop for

838
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
n right then we do another loop for
 

839
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,590
n right then we do another loop for
j in range

840
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
j in range
 

841
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,789
j in range
i okay so basically look this

842
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:14,799
i okay so basically look this
 

843
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,909
i okay so basically look this
number okay this is the number

844
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
number okay this is the number
 

845
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,510
number okay this is the number
uh one zero two n okay two n plus one

846
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
uh one zero two n okay two n plus one
 

847
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,110
uh one zero two n okay two n plus one
okay

848
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
okay
 

849
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,390
okay
and then i will be here when we

850
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
and then i will be here when we
 

851
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,029
and then i will be here when we
when we know i this is value we start

852
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
when we know i this is value we start
 

853
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:29,750
when we know i this is value we start
from j

854
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:29,760
from j
 

855
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,110
from j
j will be this point yeah

856
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
j will be this point yeah
 

857
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,150
j will be this point yeah
to get it so look when i is five

858
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
to get it so look when i is five
 

859
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,350
to get it so look when i is five
when i is five all right look

860
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
when i is five all right look
 

861
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,470
when i is five all right look
when i is five z will be zero to

862
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
when i is five z will be zero to
 

863
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,710
when i is five z will be zero to
four when i is ten zero and j will be

864
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
four when i is ten zero and j will be
 

865
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,310
four when i is ten zero and j will be
one

866
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,320
one
 

867
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,590
one
two will be the range of

868
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:51,600
two will be the range of
 

869
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,350
two will be the range of
will one 089 we're done okay so

870
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
will one 089 we're done okay so
 

871
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,909
will one 089 we're done okay so
this is basically give the complexity of

872
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
this is basically give the complexity of
 

873
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,590
this is basically give the complexity of

smaller than lambs i what do i write

880
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
smaller than lambs i what do i write
 

881
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,549
smaller than lambs i what do i write
here can you write this bit

882
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
here can you write this bit
 

883
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,390
here can you write this bit
if this number is look like 10

884
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
if this number is look like 10
 

885
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,630
if this number is look like 10
return if a is smaller than 10

886

return if a is smaller than 10
 

887
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,630
return if a is smaller than 10
so what should we do we should update

888
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
so what should we do we should update
 

889
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,789
so what should we do we should update
return no yeah we need to

890
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:36,799
return no yeah we need to
 

891
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,070
return no yeah we need to
feel the value of tp1 look

892
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
feel the value of tp1 look
 

893
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,870
feel the value of tp1 look
if a is smaller than j this this is this

894
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
if a is smaller than j this this is this
 

895
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,430
if a is smaller than j this this is this
is d

896
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,440
is d
 

897
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,950
is d
this is z this is i if numbers j

898
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:46,960
this is z this is i if numbers j
 

899
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,149
this is z this is i if numbers j
smaller than numbers i then we need to

900
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
smaller than numbers i then we need to
 

901
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,270
smaller than numbers i then we need to
update dp i equal

902
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
update dp i equal
 

903
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,510
update dp i equal
equals maxima you need to do this

904
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520
equals maxima you need to do this
 

905
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,430
equals maxima you need to do this
maximum dpi

906
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
maximum dpi
 

907
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,630
maximum dpi
is the same thing and dpy

908
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
is the same thing and dpy
 

909
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:12,789
is the same thing and dpy
dpi

910
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:12,799

 

911
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:28,950

with our

912
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:28,960

 

913
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,710

the longest subsequence that ends the

914
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
the longest subsequence that ends the
 

915
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,549
the longest subsequence that ends the
number i right number one right

916
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
number i right number one right
 

917
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,630
number i right number one right
so we need to find the maximum value of

918
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
so we need to find the maximum value of
 

919
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,230
so we need to find the maximum value of
the otp value

920
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
the otp value
 

921
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,789
the otp value
right tp0 dp1 db2 dv3 yeah i'm right

922
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
right tp0 dp1 db2 dv3 yeah i'm right
 

923
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,310
right tp0 dp1 db2 dv3 yeah i'm right
got it so it's not the last element okay

924
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
got it so it's not the last element okay
 

925
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,669
got it so it's not the last element okay
so you should we should return return

926
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
so you should we should return return
 

927
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,230
so you should we should return return
return max dp

928
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,240
return max dp
 

929
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,110
return max dp
max dp so it's all the values the

930
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,120
max dp so it's all the values the
 

931
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,190
max dp so it's all the values the
maximum value in the dp array do you get

932
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
maximum value in the dp array do you get
 

933
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,149
maximum value in the dp array do you get
it

934
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159

right all right look two three
four five and then uh

1038
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
four five and then uh
 

1039
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,950
four five and then uh
let's say ten uh

1040
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
let's say ten uh
 

1041
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,230
let's say ten uh
how can we do this the last element five

1042
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,240

 

1043
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,830

nine ten eleven two okay what's the

longest subsequence
 

1047
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,430
longest subsequence
all right what's the longest subsequence

1048
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,440
all right what's the longest subsequence
 

1049
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,630
all right what's the longest subsequence
you can think of yeah three yeah okay so

1050
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,640
you can think of yeah three yeah okay so
 

1051
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,029
you can think of yeah three yeah okay so
look

1052
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:11,039
look
 

1053
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,510
look
this f f zero is what f zero is one

1054
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
this f f zero is what f zero is one
 

1055
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,549
this f f zero is what f zero is one
zero the longest number

1056

zero the longest number
 

1057
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,070
zero the longest number
not five this is num num is already

1058
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,080
not five this is num num is already
 

1059
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,230
not five this is num num is already
zero is five but f zero is one

why is it four can you find the four you

1132
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
why is it four can you find the four you
 

1133
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,470
why is it four can you find the four you
know just say one two three four what's

1134
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
know just say one two three four what's

that's why look we check we check all
 

1163
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,230
that's why look we check we check all
the value if lambda's i smaller than

1164
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
the value if lambda's i smaller than
 

1165
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,990
the value if lambda's i smaller than
most way then we update it this is

1166
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,000
most way then we update it this is
 

1167
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,350
most way then we update it this is
dynamic programming

1168
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
dynamic programming
 

1169
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,029
dynamic programming
the spirits of dynamic programming okay

1170
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
the spirits of dynamic programming okay
 

1171
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,630
the spirits of dynamic programming okay
yeah so look i'm writing another

1172
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640
yeah so look i'm writing another
 

1173
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,389
yeah so look i'm writing another
sequence okay three

1174
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
sequence okay three
 

1175
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,430
sequence okay three
five seven maybe

1176
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,440
five seven maybe
 

1177

1179
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,350

zero okay can you write

1180
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360
zero okay can you write
 

1181
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,870
zero okay can you write
the f value f f zero

that's definitely one there's six of

1206
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:42,159
that's definitely one there's six of
 

1207
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:42,870
that's definitely one there's six of
them

1208
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:42,880
them
 

1209
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,909
them
and there's only five numbers oh

1210
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
and there's only five numbers oh
 

1211
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,110
and there's only five numbers oh
okay okay so sorry

1212
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
okay okay so sorry
 

1213
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,190
okay okay so sorry
okay okay so f zero f1 f2

1214
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,200
okay okay so f zero f1 f2
 

1215
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,230
okay okay so f zero f1 f2
f3

1216
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,240

 

1217
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:10,070

and f4

1218
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,080

 

1219
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,549

come on

1220
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:14,559

 

1221
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,190

subsequently it ends with this number

1222
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
subsequently it ends with this number
 

1223
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,029
subsequently it ends with this number
this number is numberless number in this

1224
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:19,039
this number is numberless number in this
 

1225
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,549
this number is numberless number in this
number okay the first one is definitely

1226
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:20,559
number okay the first one is definitely
 

1227
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,110
number okay the first one is definitely
one

1228
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
one
 

1229
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,230
one
this one okay

1230
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:24,240
this one okay
 

1231
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,990
this one okay
okay that's correct

1232
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,000

 

1233
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,350

yeah yeah this is correct okay

1234
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,360
yeah yeah this is correct okay
 

1235
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,029
yeah yeah this is correct okay
and what's this come on feel it come on

1236
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:33,039
and what's this come on feel it come on
 

1237
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,590
and what's this come on feel it come on
either way

1238
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:35,600

 

1239
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:52,830

yeah okay so you got one score okay one

1240
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:52,840

 

1241
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,130

[Music]
 

1245
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,350
[Music]
yeah yeah the one before i have a

1246
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,360
yeah yeah the one before i have a
 

1247
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,350
yeah yeah the one before i have a
smaller the longest you can find the

1248
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,360
smaller the longest you can find the
 

1249
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,190
smaller the longest you can find the
longest subsequence

1250
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,200
longest subsequence
 

1251
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,389
longest subsequence
on zero now this one doing well

1252
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:06,399
on zero now this one doing well
 

1253
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,470
on zero now this one doing well
there's no zero the minimum is one come

1254
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
there's no zero the minimum is one come
 

1255
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,789
there's no zero the minimum is one come
on you can start with the number yeah

1256
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:10,799
on you can start with the number yeah
 

1257
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,269
on you can start with the number yeah
so what's number one the writing

1258
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:15,279
so what's number one the writing
 

1259
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,269
so what's number one the writing
okay correct f2 f1

1260
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:19,279
okay correct f2 f1
 

1261
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,350
okay correct f2 f1
okay write it

1262
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
okay write it
 

1263
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,070
okay write it
y is two can you give me a because what

1264
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,080
y is two can you give me a because what
 

1265
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,950
y is two can you give me a because what
three five okay

1266
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:26,960
three five okay
 

1267
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,990
three five okay
and this one one

1268
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,000
and this one one
 

1269
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,470
and this one one
yeah like that why is one because they

1270
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:32,480
yeah like that why is one because they
 

1271
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,230
yeah like that why is one because they
won that's why you can't find anything

1272
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
won that's why you can't find anything
 

1273
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,990
won that's why you can't find anything
that connects with and deal with number

1274
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
that connects with and deal with number
 

1275
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,190
that connects with and deal with number
one okay

1276
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,200

 

1277
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,430

i think it's true wait wait wait wait

1278
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
i think it's true wait wait wait wait
 

1279
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,549
i think it's true wait wait wait wait

wait wait
 

1281
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,350
wait wait
number one three no no no you can't go

1282
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,360
number one three no no no you can't go
 

1283
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,870
number one three no no no you can't go
backwards come on what's this

1284
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:48,880
backwards come on what's this
 

1285
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,789
backwards come on what's this
yeah i think it's two two yeah be

1286
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
yeah i think it's two two yeah be
 

1287
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,669
yeah i think it's two two yeah be
confident come on write two

1288
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
confident come on write two
 

1289
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,590
confident come on write two
okay so what's the longest subsequence

1290
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:55,600
okay so what's the longest subsequence
 

1291
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,110
okay so what's the longest subsequence
here

1292
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
here
 

1293
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,750
here
uh two two because you find the maximum

1294
00:30:59,750 --> 00:30:59,760
uh two two because you find the maximum
 

1295
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,110
uh two two because you find the maximum
value of this yeah

1296
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,120
value of this yeah
 

1297
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,870
value of this yeah
yeah do you understand how this problem

1298
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:02,880
yeah do you understand how this problem
 

1299
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,950
yeah do you understand how this problem
is yeah

1300
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:04,960
is yeah
 

1301
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,909
is yeah
wait wait wait look the being more than

1302
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:07,919
wait wait wait look the being more than
 

1303
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:08,310
wait wait wait look the being more than
half

1304
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
half
 

1305
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,950
half
that's okay that's okay look one is

1306
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:10,960
that's okay that's okay look one is
 

1307
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,310
that's okay that's okay look one is
smaller than four

1308
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,320
smaller than four
 

1309
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,230
smaller than four
so we know that we know f3

1310
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,240
so we know that we know f3
 

1311
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,750
so we know that we know f3
is f3 is f2 plus one all right

1312
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
is f3 is f2 plus one all right
 

1313
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,789
is f3 is f2 plus one all right
yeah let's get it yeah

1314
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
yeah let's get it yeah
 

1315
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,110
yeah let's get it yeah
all right suppose we want the calculator

1316
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,120
all right suppose we want the calculator
 

1317
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,630
all right suppose we want the calculator
f3 right

1318
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:26,640
f3 right
 

1319
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,950
f3 right
right yeah because one is smaller than

1320
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:28,960
right yeah because one is smaller than
 

1321
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,269
right yeah because one is smaller than
four so we know

1322
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:31,279
four so we know
 

1323
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,549
four so we know
is f2 plus one at least it's f2 plus one

1324
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:34,559
is f2 plus one at least it's f2 plus one
 

1325
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,110
is f2 plus one at least it's f2 plus one
right because

1326
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,120
right because
 

1327
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,310
