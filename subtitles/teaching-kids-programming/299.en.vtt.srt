1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,829

hello and hello mr mr how are you today

2
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:05,839

 

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,470

today uh we uh yesterday we talked about

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
today uh we uh yesterday we talked about
 

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,310
today uh we uh yesterday we talked about
the hashing function the heisen function

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,320
the hashing function the heisen function
 

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,669
the hashing function the heisen function
allows to map absolutely large data x

8
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679
allows to map absolutely large data x
 

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,790
allows to map absolutely large data x
yeah this could be any size into a fixed

10
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
yeah this could be any size into a fixed
 

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,230
yeah this could be any size into a fixed
size which could be started to be

12
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
size which could be started to be
 

13
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,670
size which could be started to be
integer yeah

14
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
integer yeah
 

15
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,310
integer yeah
so why we we use the hashing tag hashing

16
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
so why we we use the hashing tag hashing
 

17
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,509
so why we we use the hashing tag hashing
function because we need a hashing

18
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
function because we need a hashing
 

19
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,550
function because we need a hashing
function to compute the location of the

20
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
function to compute the location of the
 

21
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,429
function to compute the location of the
of the values to be stored so basically

22
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
of the values to be stored so basically
 

23
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,229
of the values to be stored so basically
the hash table is the fixed size right

24
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
the hash table is the fixed size right
 

25
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:33,910
the hash table is the fixed size right
it's a fixed size

26
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
it's a fixed size
 

27
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,950
it's a fixed size
and then we

28
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960
and then we
 

29
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,270
and then we
calculate the data question function

30
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,280
calculate the data question function
 

31
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,430
calculate the data question function
hygiene function of the data and it

32
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
hygiene function of the data and it
 

33
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,670
hygiene function of the data and it
gives us a value so it tells us where to

34
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
gives us a value so it tells us where to
 

35
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,549
gives us a value so it tells us where to
put it

36
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
put it
 

37
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,270
put it
if they are conflicts if what is what it

38
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
if they are conflicts if what is what it
 

39
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,549
if they are conflicts if what is what it
means that if there are two different

40
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
means that if there are two different
 

41
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,310
means that if there are two different
kind of data if x e x is not equal to y

42
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
kind of data if x e x is not equal to y
 

43
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,389
kind of data if x e x is not equal to y
and if x h x equal to h y

44
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
and if x h x equal to h y
 

45
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,990
and if x h x equal to h y
that means a conflict because we have

46
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
that means a conflict because we have
 

47
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,069
that means a conflict because we have
different data different inputs but the

48
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
different data different inputs but the
 

49
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,869
different data different inputs but the
hash function give us the same

50
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
hash function give us the same
 

51
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,029
hash function give us the same
value and what it means that these two

52
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
value and what it means that these two
 

53
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,990
value and what it means that these two
values these two values x y will be

54
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
values these two values x y will be
 

55
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,070
values these two values x y will be
pointing both to the same location and

56
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
pointing both to the same location and
 

57
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,149
pointing both to the same location and
we have we can use the linked list or at

58
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
we have we can use the linked list or at
 

59
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,109
we have we can use the linked list or at
least

60
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
least
 

61
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,550
least
yeah and we

62
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
yeah and we
 

63
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,550
yeah and we
we generally don't want this to happen

64
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
we generally don't want this to happen
 

65
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,149
we generally don't want this to happen
as much as often because when this

66
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
as much as often because when this
 

67
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,270
as much as often because when this
happens

68
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
happens
 

69
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,749
happens
it means that it means that it's just it

70
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
it means that it means that it's just it
 

71
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,749
it means that it means that it's just it
will be slowed down right there'll be a

72
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
will be slowed down right there'll be a
 

73
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,870
will be slowed down right there'll be a
performance

74
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
performance
 

75
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,910
performance
degree

76
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
degree
 

77
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,550
degree
yeah because we we take on time linear

78
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
yeah because we we take on time linear
 

79
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,390
yeah because we we take on time linear
time to go through a linked list or list

80
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
time to go through a linked list or list
 

81
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,310
time to go through a linked list or list
to find out if the element is in this

82
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
to find out if the element is in this
 

83
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,109
to find out if the element is in this
right

84
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
right
 

85
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,109
right
yeah we want them the data to be

86
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
yeah we want them the data to be
 

87
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,910
yeah we want them the data to be
geographically currently distributed

88
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
geographically currently distributed
 

89
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,510
geographically currently distributed
along the

90
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
along the
 

91
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,109
along the
hash table okay

92
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119
hash table okay
 

93
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,789
hash table okay
so that's the second part reduce

94
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
so that's the second part reduce
 

95
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,950
so that's the second part reduce
condition the first part is the the

96
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
condition the first part is the the
 

97
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,789
condition the first part is the the
hashing function needs to be very very

98
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
hashing function needs to be very very
 

99
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,190
hashing function needs to be very very
fast so we don't want it to be very

100
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
fast so we don't want it to be very
 

101
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,510
fast so we don't want it to be very
complex right

102
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
complex right
 

103
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,910
complex right
and i need one way why why do we need it

104
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
and i need one way why why do we need it
 

105
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,590
and i need one way why why do we need it
one way because if it's two-way what

106
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,600
one way because if it's two-way what
 

107
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,230
one way because if it's two-way what
does it mean if it's two-way look

108
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,240
does it mean if it's two-way look
 

109
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,429
does it mean if it's two-way look
let's say if

110
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
let's say if
 

111
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,510
let's say if
hydrogen function is two-way what could

112
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
hydrogen function is two-way what could
 

113
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,709
hydrogen function is two-way what could
happen

114
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
happen
 

115
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,510
happen
if a hyphen function is two-way

116
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:05,520
if a hyphen function is two-way
 

117
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,190
if a hyphen function is two-way
what possibly problems can you think of

118
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
what possibly problems can you think of
 

119
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,469
what possibly problems can you think of
right

120
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
right
 

121
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,270
right
if hx if you hx equals you'll get the

122
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
if hx if you hx equals you'll get the
 

123
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,110
if hx if you hx equals you'll get the
value v yeah

124
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
value v yeah
 

125
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,589
value v yeah
if if you can come up with some function

126
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
if if you can come up with some function
 

127
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,150
if if you can come up with some function
fv and that will come up

128
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
fv and that will come up
 

129
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,750
fv and that will come up
that will give you the x what does it

130
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
that will give you the x what does it
 

131
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,030
that will give you the x what does it
mean what what does it say

132
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040

 

133
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,390

what what

134
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
what what
 

135
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,830
what what
that's two ways right

136
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:27,840
that's two ways right
 

137
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,589
that's two ways right
then what problem would that

138
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
then what problem would that
 

139
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,910
then what problem would that
give us so

140
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
give us so
 

141
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,949
give us so
no it means look if it's two way yeah if

142
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
no it means look if it's two way yeah if
 

143
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,710
no it means look if it's two way yeah if
it's one if it's two-way it means that

144
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
it's one if it's two-way it means that
 

145
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,190
it's one if it's two-way it means that
if if d somehow is leaked the data is

146
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
if if d somehow is leaked the data is
 

147
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,309
if if d somehow is leaked the data is
big here

148
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
big here
 

149
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,390
big here
like that the hashing location is late

150
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
like that the hashing location is late
 

151
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,470
like that the hashing location is late
then i can deduce

152
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
then i can deduce
 

153
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,110
then i can deduce
the original key will be deduced right

154
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
the original key will be deduced right
 

155
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,390
the original key will be deduced right
right and there will be a security

156
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
right and there will be a security
 

157
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,309
right and there will be a security
security problem right for example like

158
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
security problem right for example like
 

159
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,390
security problem right for example like
even the next one you're not sure but

160
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
even the next one you're not sure but
 

161
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,550
even the next one you're not sure but
you can try right if it's a you can

162
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
you can try right if it's a you can
 

163
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,949
you can try right if it's a you can
deduce it right you can deduce it it

164
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
deduce it right you can deduce it it
 

165
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,949
deduce it right you can deduce it it
means that it's not it's not safe at all

166
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
means that it's not it's not safe at all
 

167
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,630
means that it's not it's not safe at all
but because generally

168
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
but because generally
 

169
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,030
but because generally
in database yeah when we store the data

170
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
in database yeah when we store the data
 

171
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,830
in database yeah when we store the data
we

172
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
we
 

173
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,589
we
when we store the password right you

174
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
when we store the password right you
 

175
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,750
when we store the password right you
know password is very

176
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
know password is very
 

177
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,390
know password is very
secret secret a password

178
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
secret secret a password
 

179
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,910
secret secret a password
usually they don't store a password in

180
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
usually they don't store a password in
 

181
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,390
usually they don't store a password in
in a database in which database database

182
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
in a database in which database database
 

183
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,710
in a database in which database database
place to store the japanese

184
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
place to store the japanese
 

185
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,229
place to store the japanese
stuff yeah

186
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
stuff yeah
 

187
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,860
stuff yeah
look how do they usually do if you want

188
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:24,870
look how do they usually do if you want
 

189
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,630
look how do they usually do if you want
[Music]

190
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
[Music]
 

191
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,750
[Music]
so in database okay in database usually

192
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
so in database okay in database usually
 

193
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,030
so in database okay in database usually
you have uh user here user and then you

194
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
you have uh user here user and then you
 

195
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,550
you have uh user here user and then you
have a password right

196
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
have a password right
 

197
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,990
have a password right
right all right

198
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
right all right
 

199
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,430
right all right
password

200
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
password
 

201
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,869
password
password

202
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879

 

203
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,550

so let's say look

204
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
so let's say look
 

205
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,990
so let's say look
eric

206
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
eric
 

207
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,750
eric
if your password is one two three four

208
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
if your password is one two three four
 

209
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,030
if your password is one two three four
okay this is the very simple password

210
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
okay this is the very simple password
 

211
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,869
okay this is the very simple password
your password is simple prospective one

212
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
your password is simple prospective one
 

213
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,750
your password is simple prospective one
okay

214
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
okay
 

215
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,750
okay
so if somehow this information is leaked

216
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
so if somehow this information is leaked
 

217
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,670
so if somehow this information is leaked
right and people can use your password

218
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
right and people can use your password
 

219
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,030
right and people can use your password
to do something

220
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
to do something
 

221
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,070
to do something
yeah

222
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
yeah
 

223
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,789
yeah
bad right we don't want that we want to

224
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
bad right we don't want that we want to
 

225
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,550
bad right we don't want that we want to
illegal we don't we want to prevent that

226
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
illegal we don't we want to prevent that
 

227
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,589
illegal we don't we want to prevent that
happening so

228
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599

 

229
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,309

we don't solve the plan password in that

230
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
we don't solve the plan password in that
 

231
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,390
we don't solve the plan password in that
instead we store a hashing function

232
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
instead we store a hashing function
 

233
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,390
instead we store a hashing function
right we store a hashing from there

234
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
right we store a hashing from there
 

235
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,789
right we store a hashing from there
usually there's an md5 we usually we can

236
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
usually there's an md5 we usually we can
 

237
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,310
usually there's an md5 we usually we can
store md5 or another existing shard

238
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
store md5 or another existing shard
 

239
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,670
store md5 or another existing shard
two five six

240
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
two five six
 

241
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,590
two five six
so what it does this hashing function

242
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
so what it does this hashing function
 

243
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,550
so what it does this hashing function
with that is you md5 look it give you uh

244
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
with that is you md5 look it give you uh
 

245
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,790
with that is you md5 look it give you uh
any password right any password and then

246
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
any password right any password and then
 

247
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,230
any password right any password and then
give you

248
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
give you
 

249
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,550
give you
32 bit yeah it's a little bit

250
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
32 bit yeah it's a little bit
 

251
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,629
32 bit yeah it's a little bit
something like that here

252
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639

 

253
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,270

so look if md5 i hatching i i give a

254
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
so look if md5 i hatching i i give a
 

255
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,710
so look if md5 i hatching i i give a
hashing yeah

256
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
hashing yeah
 

257
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,350
hashing yeah
hashing so eric you give something

258
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
hashing so eric you give something
 

259
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,150
hashing so eric you give something
hashing ax p t c

260
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
hashing ax p t c
 

261
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,150
hashing ax p t c
right or orion could be something

262
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
right or orion could be something
 

263
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,150
right or orion could be something
different p u

264
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
different p u
 

265
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,430
different p u
t t one okay something i just come up

266
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
t t one okay something i just come up
 

267
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,189
t t one okay something i just come up
so imagine

268
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
so imagine
 

269
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,990
so imagine
yeah yeah imagine this invention this

270
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
yeah yeah imagine this invention this
 

271
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,510
yeah yeah imagine this invention this
information is leaked

272
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520

 

273
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,189

okay what i'm saying is that if this

274
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
okay what i'm saying is that if this
 

275
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,189
okay what i'm saying is that if this
information is legal

276
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
information is legal
 

277
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,790
information is legal
can people directly make use of that

278
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
can people directly make use of that
 

279
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,070
can people directly make use of that
right no right

280
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
right no right
 

281
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,390
right no right
because maybe

282
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
because maybe
 

283
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,310
because maybe
if this look if h actually this password

284
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
if this look if h actually this password
 

285
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,350
if this look if h actually this password
gives to this column right and they

286
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
gives to this column right and they
 

287
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,070
gives to this column right and they
put one yeah yeah okay i'm just saying

288
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
put one yeah yeah okay i'm just saying
 

289
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,710
put one yeah yeah okay i'm just saying
that if this data this encrypted is

290
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
that if this data this encrypted is
 

291
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,110
that if this data this encrypted is
hashed it's not included it has the

292
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
hashed it's not included it has the
 

293
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,430
hashed it's not included it has the
password it's leaked

294
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
password it's leaked
 

295
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,110
password it's leaked
then it's less

296
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
then it's less
 

297
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,870
then it's less
a big problem right because people

298
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
a big problem right because people
 

299
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,790
a big problem right because people
cannot this is not a real

300
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
cannot this is not a real
 

301
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,710
cannot this is not a real
uh original password and people cannot

302
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
uh original password and people cannot
 

303
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,070
uh original password and people cannot
make use of these these are the

304
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
make use of these these are the
 

305
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,830
make use of these these are the
encrypted one and then they know they

306
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
encrypted one and then they know they
 

307
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,909
encrypted one and then they know they
cannot be produced

308
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
cannot be produced
 

309
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,230
cannot be produced
to the original one right got it

310
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
to the original one right got it
 

311
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,710
to the original one right got it
yeah they understand yeah

312
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
yeah they understand yeah
 

313
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,790
yeah they understand yeah
yeah

314
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
yeah
 

315
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,710
yeah
okay so for example like look this

316
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
okay so for example like look this
 

317
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,070
okay so for example like look this
hashing function the creation what

318
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
hashing function the creation what
 

319
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,230
hashing function the creation what
happened look if based on this if

320
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
happened look if based on this if
 

321
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,110
happened look if based on this if
another way if mommy yeah

322
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
another way if mommy yeah
 

323
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,629
another way if mommy yeah
mommy

324
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
mommy
 

325
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,749
mommy
mommy but

326
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
mommy but
 

327
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,830
mommy but
mom is encrypted the hashing function

328
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
mom is encrypted the hashing function
 

329
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,510
mom is encrypted the hashing function
okay so suppose there's a hashing phone

330
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
okay so suppose there's a hashing phone
 

331
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,150
okay so suppose there's a hashing phone
it's also axptc

332
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
it's also axptc
 

333
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,070
it's also axptc
so what does it mean

334
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
so what does it mean
 

335
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,070
so what does it mean
so mommy can use the same password all

336
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
so mommy can use the same password all
 

337
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,230
so mommy can use the same password all
different but look your password is one

338
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
different but look your password is one
 

339
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,469
different but look your password is one
two three four maybe mommy's password is

340
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
two three four maybe mommy's password is
 

341
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,309
two three four maybe mommy's password is
abcd but but the h hashing function hash

342
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
abcd but but the h hashing function hash
 

343
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,070
abcd but but the h hashing function hash
function gives

344
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
function gives
 

345
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,590
function gives
a b c d

346
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
a b c d
 

347
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,909
a b c d
to this asptcf

348
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:28,919
to this asptcf
 

349
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,230
to this asptcf
h1234 he also gives the ax ptc

350
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
h1234 he also gives the ax ptc
 

351
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,830
h1234 he also gives the ax ptc
so what does it mean

352
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
so what does it mean
 

353
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,350
so what does it mean
there's a connection right because the

354
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
there's a connection right because the
 

355
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,110
there's a connection right because the
different input

356
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
different input
 

357
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,469
different input
the hash to the same output the keys

358
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
the hash to the same output the keys
 

359
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,830
the hash to the same output the keys
so in siri right in siri mommy could use

360
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
so in siri right in siri mommy could use
 

361
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,870
so in siri right in siri mommy could use
their username and password

362
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
their username and password
 

363
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,790
their username and password
you have to log in right but but she

364
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
you have to log in right but but she
 

365
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,790
you have to log in right but but she
might not right she might not know right

366
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
might not right she might not know right
 

367
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,510
might not right she might not know right
no

368
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
no
 

369
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,029
no
yeah

370
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
yeah
 

371
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,790
yeah
yeah you can do this differently yeah

372
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
yeah you can do this differently yeah
 

373
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,029
yeah you can do this differently yeah
yeah

374
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
yeah
 

375
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,990
yeah
okay so um today we talk about how to

376
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
okay so um today we talk about how to
 

377
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,189
okay so um today we talk about how to
design a hash table definitely hashtag

378
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
design a hash table definitely hashtag
 

379
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,510
design a hash table definitely hashtag
no no no it's

380
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
no no no it's
 

381
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,390
no no no it's
very fast

382
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400

 

383
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,350

you need a better oh my

384
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
you need a better oh my
 

385
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,990
you need a better oh my
yes this is getting

386
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
yes this is getting
 

387
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,309
yes this is getting
bad

388
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
bad
 

389
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,309
bad
okay so let's say we have a

390
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
okay so let's say we have a
 

391
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,749
okay so let's say we have a
hash table of 10 10 yeah

392
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
hash table of 10 10 yeah
 

393
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,710
hash table of 10 10 yeah
let's say we have a test table so

394
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
let's say we have a test table so
 

395
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,589
let's say we have a test table so
at most ten elements

396
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
at most ten elements
 

397
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,550
at most ten elements
this is zero one two three four five six

398
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
this is zero one two three four five six
 

399
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,150
this is zero one two three four five six
seven

400
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
seven
 

401
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,110
seven
okay

402
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
okay
 

403
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,189
okay
a nine ten okay

404
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
a nine ten okay
 

405
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:39,990
a nine ten okay
okay

406
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
okay
 

407
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,029
okay
yeah so let's make it simpler our keys

408
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
yeah so let's make it simpler our keys
 

409
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,469
yeah so let's make it simpler our keys
are the integers

410
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
are the integers
 

411
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,350
are the integers
okay

412
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
okay
 

413
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,309
okay
so we have we have let's say we have uh

414
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
so we have we have let's say we have uh
 

415
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,029
so we have we have let's say we have uh
we have uh

416
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
we have uh
 

417
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,869
we have uh
okay let's say the key this is the hash

418
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
okay let's say the key this is the hash
 

419
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,790
okay let's say the key this is the hash
table yeah heist table this hash table

420
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
table yeah heist table this hash table
 

421
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,029
table yeah heist table this hash table
so we have a key here we have a key the

422
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
so we have a key here we have a key the
 

423
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,350
so we have a key here we have a key the
value this is integer and let's say if

424
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
value this is integer and let's say if
 

425
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,950
value this is integer and let's say if
our values is range from 1 to 20 oh no

426
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
our values is range from 1 to 20 oh no
 

427
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,070
our values is range from 1 to 20 oh no
no let's say from 1 to yeah from 1 to 20

428
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
no let's say from 1 to yeah from 1 to 20
 

429
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,350
no let's say from 1 to yeah from 1 to 20
okay

430
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
okay
 

431
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,469
okay
1 to 20 inclusive yeah 1 to 20. so how

432
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
1 to 20 inclusive yeah 1 to 20. so how
 

433
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,070
1 to 20 inclusive yeah 1 to 20. so how
would you map this 1 to 20 to 1 to 10

434
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
would you map this 1 to 20 to 1 to 10
 

435
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,270
would you map this 1 to 20 to 1 to 10
right

436
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
right
 

437
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,150
right
how would you do it

438
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160

 

439
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,909

how would you do it

440
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
how would you do it
 

441
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,670
how would you do it
which function we

442
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
which function we
 

443
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,670
which function we
let's come up with a simple

444
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
let's come up with a simple
 

445
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,830
let's come up with a simple
hash function okay we haven't

446
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
hash function okay we haven't
 

447
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,350
hash function okay we haven't
we haven't talked about a simple hash

448
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
we haven't talked about a simple hash
 

449
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,670
we haven't talked about a simple hash
function how do we have how do we map

450
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
function how do we have how do we map
 

451
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,909
function how do we have how do we map
something into a

452
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
something into a
 

453
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,990
something into a
into a fixed size table

454
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
into a fixed size table
 

455
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,589
into a fixed size table
and

456
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
and
 

457
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,589
and
how do we fix it

458
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
how do we fix it
 

459
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,149
how do we fix it
look at it define

460
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
look at it define
 

461
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,990
look at it define
hash hashtag

462
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
hash hashtag
 

463
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,150
hash hashtag
okay let's say key okay and key this is

464
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
okay let's say key okay and key this is
 

465
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,750
okay let's say key okay and key this is
key how do we

466
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
key how do we
 

467
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,310
key how do we
we know the size is 10 yeah we know this

468
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
we know the size is 10 yeah we know this
 

469
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,509
we know the size is 10 yeah we know this
table size size is 10.

470
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
table size size is 10.
 

471
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,470
table size size is 10.
size is 10 okay we know the size system

472
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
size is 10 okay we know the size system
 

473
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,790
size is 10 okay we know the size system
and how do we map this key the key this

474
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
and how do we map this key the key this
 

475
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,870
and how do we map this key the key this
is the integer right so this is the

476
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
is the integer right so this is the
 

477
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,030
is the integer right so this is the
integer key in

478
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
integer key in
 

479
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,829
integer key in
and now we want to return to it

480
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
and now we want to return to it
 

481
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,310
and now we want to return to it
right right yes

482
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
right right yes
 

483
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,990
right right yes
okay so i give you a

484
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
okay so i give you a
 

485
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,150
okay so i give you a
so we want to come up with a function to

486
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
so we want to come up with a function to
 

487
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,710
so we want to come up with a function to
map the integer to an integer but which

488
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
map the integer to an integer but which
 

489
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,310
map the integer to an integer but which
is the fixed size

490
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
is the fixed size
 

491
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,110
is the fixed size
yeah

492
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
yeah
 

493
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,269
yeah
so how can we do it this side type there

494
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
so how can we do it this side type there
 

495
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,949
so how can we do it this side type there
are ten elements in the table and then

496
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
are ten elements in the table and then
 

497
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,910
are ten elements in the table and then
our keys are twenty one to twenty so

498
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920

 

499
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,350

like i i

500
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
like i i
 

501
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,590
like i i
i have a few examples you tell me what

502
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
i have a few examples you tell me what
 

503
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,829
i have a few examples you tell me what
what is this function okay it guess okay

504
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
what is this function okay it guess okay
 

505
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,310
what is this function okay it guess okay
look one if it's one i want to i only

506
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
look one if it's one i want to i only
 

507
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,790
look one if it's one i want to i only
store in one if it's two i only need to

508
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
store in one if it's two i only need to
 

509
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,230
store in one if it's two i only need to
store in two

510
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
store in two
 

511
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,310
store in two
if it's four i wanted to do so far no no

512
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
if it's four i wanted to do so far no no
 

513
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,870
if it's four i wanted to do so far no no
no yet because i if it's 11 i want to

514
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
no yet because i if it's 11 i want to
 

515
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,790
no yet because i if it's 11 i want to
throw in one

516
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
throw in one
 

517
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,910
throw in one
it's 15 i want you to store in five

518
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
it's 15 i want you to store in five
 

519
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,190
it's 15 i want you to store in five
because they only

520
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
because they only
 

521
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,670
because they only
from zero one two three four five six

522
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
from zero one two three four five six
 

523
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,630
from zero one two three four five six
seven

524
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
seven
 

525
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,190
seven
eight nine ten right uh okay they're

526
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
eight nine ten right uh okay they're
 

527
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,150
eight nine ten right uh okay they're
enough eleven okay let's say nine here's

528
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
enough eleven okay let's say nine here's
 

529
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,870
enough eleven okay let's say nine here's
the nine that's ten ten eleven okay

530
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
the nine that's ten ten eleven okay
 

531
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,590
the nine that's ten ten eleven okay
so it's one

532
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
so it's one
 

533
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,910
so it's one
if it's one i want to store in one oh i

534
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
if it's one i want to store in one oh i
 

535
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,509
if it's one i want to store in one oh i
know like when you did eleven

536
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:13,519
know like when you did eleven
 

537
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,590
know like when you did eleven
because it goes nine and then back to

538
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
because it goes nine and then back to
 

539
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:24,480
because it goes nine and then back to
the start

540
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,490

yeah um instead of like 11 is like nine

544
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
yeah um instead of like 11 is like nine
 

545
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,069
yeah um instead of like 11 is like nine
and then you go back to the start ten

546
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
and then you go back to the start ten
 

547
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,030
and then you go back to the start ten
eleven it's one

548
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,040
eleven it's one
 

549
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,389

moderators what's this model

564
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,079
moderators what's this model
 

565
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,630
moderators what's this model
um

566
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640

 

567
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,829

come on

568
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839

 

569
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,230

that's the simplest function look we

570
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
that's the simplest function look we
 

571
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,829
that's the simplest function look we
have uh

572
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
have uh
 

573
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,230
have uh
we have a lot of keys to put in the

574
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
we have a lot of keys to put in the
 

575
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,310
we have a lot of keys to put in the
table right but we can usually these

576
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
table right but we can usually these
 

577
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,150
table right but we can usually these
modulus functions to to restrict it

578
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
modulus functions to to restrict it
 

579
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,949
modulus functions to to restrict it
inside the table right okay

580
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
inside the table right okay
 

581
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,550
inside the table right okay
and how about looking

582
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
and how about looking
 

583
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,949
and how about looking
what happened look look at this one goes

584
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
what happened look look at this one goes
 

585
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,430
what happened look look at this one goes
to one and ten eleven goes to one so

586
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
to one and ten eleven goes to one so
 

587
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,030
to one and ten eleven goes to one so
what happened yeah

588
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
what happened yeah
 

589
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,870
what happened yeah
all right what happened here

590
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
all right what happened here
 

591
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,030
all right what happened here
one goes to one so one here

592
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
one goes to one so one here
 

593
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,710
one goes to one so one here
yeah so one i i have one one the first

594
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
yeah so one i i have one one the first
 

595
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,350
yeah so one i i have one one the first
the two part i remember that yoga yeah

596
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
the two part i remember that yoga yeah
 

597
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,269
the two part i remember that yoga yeah
the key on the tuber is the key the

598
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
the key on the tuber is the key the
 

599
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,350
the key on the tuber is the key the
original key the value

600
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,360
original key the value
 

601
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,310
original key the value
is this value okay we can we can

602
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
is this value okay we can we can
 

603
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,470
is this value okay we can we can
worry about that later the key value

604
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
worry about that later the key value
 

605
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,230
worry about that later the key value
pair because in hash table you have a

606
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
pair because in hash table you have a
 

607
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,310
pair because in hash table you have a
key value pair yeah

608
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
key value pair yeah
 

609
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,110
key value pair yeah
and then look 11 1

610
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
and then look 11 1
 

611
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,470
and then look 11 1
close to 1 here so you put at the end

612
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
close to 1 here so you put at the end
 

613
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,910
close to 1 here so you put at the end
11 original list is in keys 11 and then

614
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
11 original list is in keys 11 and then
 

615
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,150
11 original list is in keys 11 and then
one okay

616
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,160
one okay
 

617
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,389
one okay
the value could be anything okay

618
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
the value could be anything okay
 

619
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,310
the value could be anything okay
it doesn't matter anything

620
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
it doesn't matter anything
 

621
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,069
it doesn't matter anything
anything

622
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
anything
 

623
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,269
anything
okay yes can you sit back please again

624
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
okay yes can you sit back please again
 

625
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,710
okay yes can you sit back please again
we're sitting yes okay

626
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
we're sitting yes okay
 

627
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,269
we're sitting yes okay
so now today we're going to

628
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
so now today we're going to
 

629
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,710
so now today we're going to
design this right so when we

630
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
design this right so when we
 

631
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,110
design this right so when we
uh we talked about a three operation

632
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
uh we talked about a three operation
 

633
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,389
uh we talked about a three operation
right to get a key to get a value right

634
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
right to get a key to get a value right
 

635
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,230
right to get a key to get a value right
get a get a value

636
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
get a get a value
 

637
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,870
get a get a value
get a value to update

638
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
get a value to update
 

639
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,710
get a value to update
and update

640
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
and update
 

641
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,110
and update
after a key value pair

642
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120

 

643
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,790

and then to remove a key all right

644
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
and then to remove a key all right
 

645
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,990
and then to remove a key all right
remove a key

646
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000

 

647
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,870

okay

648
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
okay
 

649
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,389
okay
these three operations

650
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
these three operations
 

651
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,750
these three operations
to get the key

652
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
to get the key
 

653
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,629
to get the key
first of all we compute this right

654
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
first of all we compute this right
 

655
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,269
first of all we compute this right
computer h key h function to tell us

656
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
computer h key h function to tell us
 

657
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,430
computer h key h function to tell us
where it's going to start and now we go

658
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
where it's going to start and now we go
 

659
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,949
where it's going to start and now we go
through this linkage to find out if

660
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
through this linkage to find out if
 

661
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,110
through this linkage to find out if
there's a key in there if it's their

662
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,120
there's a key in there if it's their
 

663
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,710
there's a key in there if it's their
skill would return the value and the

664
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
skill would return the value and the
 

665
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,670
skill would return the value and the

when we go through the linked list we
know the previous one right so all we

know the previous one right so all we
 

757
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,230
know the previous one right so all we
can do is what

758
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240
can do is what
 

759
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,470
can do is what
we want to take this out

00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
we want to take this out
 

761
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,069
we want to take this out
and we want to re

and we want to re
 

763
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,189
and we want to re
really modify the previous link to point

764
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
really modify the previous link to point
 

765
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,990
really modify the previous link to point
it to the next one right yeah

00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
it to the next one right yeah
 

767
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,870
it to the next one right yeah
all right instead of copying today to

all right instead of copying today to

there's no way to get the last value
 

775
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,870
there's no way to get the last value
without going one by one traversing to

without going one by one traversing to

the list provides us with random access

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
the list provides us with random access
 

781
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,509
the list provides us with random access
because we can just get it by index

because we can just get it by index

right i travelling i traveling i found

808
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
right i travelling i traveling i found
 

809
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,790

this link note

810
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
this link note
 

811
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,470
this link note
and obviously i know the previous one

812
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
and obviously i know the previous one
 

813
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,629
and obviously i know the previous one
here because i come from there

814
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
here because i come from there
 

815
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,509
here because i come from there
and what do i do i modify the previous

816
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
and what do i do i modify the previous
 

817
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,310
and what do i do i modify the previous
one

818
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
one
 

819
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,430
one
to point it to it pointed next to its

820
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
to point it to it pointed next to its
 

821
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,670
to point it to it pointed next to its
next one to the current notes next one

822
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
next one to the current notes next one
 

823
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,590
next one to the current notes next one
right so it's slightly different but a

824
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
right so it's slightly different but a
 

825
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,870
right so it's slightly different but a
constant term

826
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
constant term
 

827
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,470
constant term
when we multiply

828
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
when we multiply
 

829
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,110
when we multiply
when we know where where is the element

830
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
when we know where where is the element
 

831
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,030
when we know where where is the element
we want to remove it's always constant

832
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
we want to remove it's always constant
 

833
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,509
we want to remove it's always constant
right if you are given a number to

834
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
right if you are given a number to
 

835
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,670
right if you are given a number to
remove it's constant for example at

836
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
remove it's constant for example at
 

837
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,670
remove it's constant for example at
least you just copy the last one and you

838
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
least you just copy the last one and you
 

839
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,990
least you just copy the last one and you
remove the element for last one for the

840
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
remove the element for last one for the
 

841
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,550
remove the element for last one for the
link list you know this node is going to

842
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
link list you know this node is going to
 

843
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,509
link list you know this node is going to
take off right you modify the previous

844
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
take off right you modify the previous
 

845
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,389
take off right you modify the previous
link next thing to point to the next one

846
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
link next thing to point to the next one
 

847
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,269
link next thing to point to the next one
okay

848
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
okay
 

849
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,430
okay
okay then let's do it

850
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
okay then let's do it
 

851
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:47,430
okay then let's do it
yay let's do it

852
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440

 

853
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,230

okay so let's write it in a class okay

854
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
okay so let's write it in a class okay
 

855
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,069
okay so let's write it in a class okay
obviously we have talked about this

856
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
obviously we have talked about this
 

857
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,430
obviously we have talked about this
before of ob class

858
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
before of ob class
 

859
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,949
before of ob class
class

860
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
class
 

861
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,509
class
what class what's this keyword class

862
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
what class what's this keyword class
 

863
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,110
what class what's this keyword class
a class is

864
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
a class is
 

865
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,829
a class is
where like here one year to year

866
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839

 

867
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,069

it's object oriented thing like a person

868
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
it's object oriented thing like a person
 

869
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,870
it's object oriented thing like a person
right

870
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
right
 

871
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,230
right
yeah the object oriented yes like

872
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
yeah the object oriented yes like
 

873
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,189
yeah the object oriented yes like
like glass like class one is the best

874
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
like glass like class one is the best
 

875
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,549
like glass like class one is the best
okay

876
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
okay
 

877
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,429
okay
like in castle anything like that like

878
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
like in castle anything like that like
 

879
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,949
like in castle anything like that like
an object hash table so i can use this

880
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
an object hash table so i can use this
 

881
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,189
an object hash table so i can use this
the class is you can think of it as a

882
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:25,199
the class is you can think of it as a
 

883
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,189
the class is you can think of it as a
data container right a container

884
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
data container right a container
 

885
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,310
data container right a container
contains of these data and methods right

886
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
contains of these data and methods right
 

887
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,590
contains of these data and methods right
like a person class class person right

888
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
like a person class class person right
 

889
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,310
like a person class class person right
class person and person has the name age

890
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
class person and person has the name age
 

891
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,909
class person and person has the name age
right this attribute

892
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
right this attribute
 

893
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,710
right this attribute
and it has method like talk thing done

894
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:40,720
and it has method like talk thing done
 

895
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,150
and it has method like talk thing done
right got it

896
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,160
right got it
 

897
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,630
right got it
yeah and then you can use this obj class

898
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
yeah and then you can use this obj class
 

899
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,510
yeah and then you can use this obj class
to initiate to create different objects

900
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
to initiate to create different objects
 

901
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,789
to initiate to create different objects
like

902
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
like
 

903
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,350
like
i was eric equals

904
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
i was eric equals
 

905
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,390
i was eric equals
class

906
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
class
 

907
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,870
class
he was person name h right something

908
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:54,880
he was person name h right something
 

909
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,070
he was person name h right something
like that and ryan equals person

910
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
like that and ryan equals person
 

911
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,270
like that and ryan equals person
name age

912
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
name age
 

913
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,870
name age
so in this case we have created two

914
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880
so in this case we have created two
 

915
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,789
so in this case we have created two
objects which is uh

916
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
objects which is uh
 

917
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,350
objects which is uh
all belongs to the class person right so

918
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
all belongs to the class person right so
 

919
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,789
all belongs to the class person right so
a person

920
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
a person
 

921
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,350
a person
the class is like object template okay

922
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
the class is like object template okay
 

923
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,029
the class is like object template okay
the hash table so we could we want to

924
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
the hash table so we could we want to
 

925
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,029
the hash table so we could we want to
create a hash table

926
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
create a hash table
 

927
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,950
create a hash table
so first of all we want to initialize

928
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
so first of all we want to initialize
 

929
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,710
so first of all we want to initialize
the defined constructor yeah to

930
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
the defined constructor yeah to
 

931
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,750
the defined constructor yeah to
understand

932
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
understand
 

933
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,270
understand
underscore in

934
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,280
underscore in
 

935
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,470
underscore in
in it

936
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480

 

937
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,110

so let's say we let's say that we want

938
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
so let's say we let's say that we want
 

939
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,830
so let's say we let's say that we want
to install this hash table in a minion

940
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
to install this hash table in a minion
 

941
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,430
to install this hash table in a minion
right or maybe

942
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
right or maybe
 

943
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,270
right or maybe
let's say self

944
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
let's say self
 

945
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,789
let's say self
dot size

946
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
dot size
 

947
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,070
dot size
table size equal maybe

948
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
table size equal maybe
 

949
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,390
table size equal maybe
so in practically speaking this number

950
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
so in practically speaking this number
 

951
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,430
so in practically speaking this number
has to be

952
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:39,440
has to be
 

953
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,430
has to be
it's better to be a prime number so to

954
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
it's better to be a prime number so to
 

955
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,789
it's better to be a prime number so to
reduce the

956
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
reduce the
 

957
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,549
reduce the
collection so let's say can you give me

958
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
collection so let's say can you give me
 

959
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,549
collection so let's say can you give me
a prime number nine

960
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
a prime number nine
 

961
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,110
a prime number nine
no no no

962
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
no no no
 

963
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,270
no no no
okay 29 or seven bigger the better okay

964
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
okay 29 or seven bigger the better okay
 

965
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,750
okay 29 or seven bigger the better okay
i should i i the biggest

966
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:53,760
i should i i the biggest
 

967
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,150
i should i i the biggest
three the biggest point number i can

968
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,160
three the biggest point number i can
 

969
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,029
three the biggest point number i can
think of is 97 no no no 6 5 5

970
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
think of is 97 no no no 6 5 5
 

971
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:01,909
think of is 97 no no no 6 5 5
6

972
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
6
 

973
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,669
6
7.

974

7.
 

975
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,830
7.
how do you know that's the prime number

976
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
how do you know that's the prime number
 

977
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,190
how do you know that's the prime number
babe

978
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,200

 

979
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,909

did you okay that up

980
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
did you okay that up
 

981
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,789
did you okay that up
yeah

but this is
 

985
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,510
but this is
this is a prime number because i know

986
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
this is a prime number because i know
 

987
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,230
this is a prime number because i know
six five five

988
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
six five five
 

989
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,110
six five five
three six this is

990
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
three six this is
 

991
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,070
three six this is
this is 2 to the power of you know

992
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
this is 2 to the power of you know
 

993
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,909
this is 2 to the power of you know
16 maybe

1001
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,230

2 to the power of 16 plus 1 this is the

1002
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
2 to the power of 16 plus 1 this is the
 

1003
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,070
2 to the power of 16 plus 1 this is the
prime number

1004
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
prime number
 

1005
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,070
prime number
okay

1006
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
okay
 

1007
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,150
okay
okay we can look we can check later

1008
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,160
okay we can look we can check later
 

1009
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,430
okay we can look we can check later
even

1010
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
even
 

1011
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,150
even
what it's not even our odd number this

1012
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
what it's not even our odd number this
 

1013
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,470
what it's not even our odd number this
is the 2 to the power of 16

1014
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
is the 2 to the power of 16
 

1015
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,549
is the 2 to the power of 16
right this is obviously not a prime

1016
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:50,559
right this is obviously not a prime
 

1017
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,070
right this is obviously not a prime
number

1018
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
number
 

1019
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,470
number
i plus one what does it mean yeah it's a

1020
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:54,480
i plus one what does it mean yeah it's a
 

1021
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,310
i plus one what does it mean yeah it's a
prime number right

1022
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
prime number right
 

1023
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,630
prime number right
because you cannot find anything

1024
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
because you cannot find anything
 

1025
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,310
because you cannot find anything
that can be devised

1026
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
that can be devised
 

1027
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,510
that can be devised
by

1028
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
by
 

1029
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,390
by
any factors between one and itself right

1030
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,400
any factors between one and itself right
 

1031
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,549
any factors between one and itself right
okay so now we want to store this data

1032
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
okay so now we want to store this data
 

1033
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,350
okay so now we want to store this data
in the data save the data

1034
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
in the data save the data
 

1035
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,430
in the data save the data
remember how do we store this so each

1036
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:11,440
remember how do we store this so each
 

1037
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,870
remember how do we store this so each
one look

1038
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
one look
 

1039
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,710
one look
so look this table has 6 5 5

1040
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
so look this table has 6 5 5
 

1041
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,630
so look this table has 6 5 5
37 slots export spaces

yeah for each one

1044
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
yeah for each one
 

1045
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,029
yeah for each one
first one ryan alright for each one it's

1046
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
first one ryan alright for each one it's
 

1047
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,789
first one ryan alright for each one it's
a list there we're going to have a link

1048
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799
a list there we're going to have a link
 

1049
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,789
a list there we're going to have a link
list yeah so you'll be at least a list

1050
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
list yeah so you'll be at least a list
 

1051
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,190
list yeah so you'll be at least a list
of elements a list of elements all

1052
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
of elements a list of elements all
 

1053
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,430
of elements a list of elements all
linked list it'll be something like that

1054
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440
linked list it'll be something like that
 

1055
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,470
linked list it'll be something like that
yeah

1056
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
yeah
 

1057
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,630
yeah
and to make it simple we use a list so

1058
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:36,640
and to make it simple we use a list so
 

1059
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,750
and to make it simple we use a list so

up with a simple function remember

1094
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
up with a simple function remember
 

1095
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,390
up with a simple function remember
define get key okay this is get key

1096
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
define get key okay this is get key
 

1097
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,830
define get key okay this is get key
let's get key from here if you give a

1098
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:14,840
let's get key from here if you give a
 

1099
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,270
let's get key from here if you give a
key a key and then we need to return

1100
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
key a key and then we need to return
 

1101
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,669
key a key and then we need to return
we have a key

1102
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
we have a key
 

1103
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,149
we have a key
modulus right modulus

1104
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
modulus right modulus
 

1105
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,590
modulus right modulus
modulus save the size right

1106
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
modulus save the size right
 

1107
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,510
modulus save the size right
okay

1108
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:29,520
okay
 

1109
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,990
okay
pay attention here this hash function

1110
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
pay attention here this hash function
 

1111
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,830
pay attention here this hash function
this is the simple the simplest hash

1112
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
this is the simple the simplest hash
 

1113
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,830
this is the simple the simplest hash
function you don't have to you can put

1114
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:35,840
function you don't have to you can put
 

1115
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,350
function you don't have to you can put
you can write it

1116
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
you can write it
 

1117
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,750
you can write it
other ways or you can provide your

1118
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
other ways or you can provide your
 

1119
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,230
other ways or you can provide your
hash function but we usually want hash

1120
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
hash function but we usually want hash
 

1121
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,070
hash function but we usually want hash
function to be fast this is very fast

1122
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
function to be fast this is very fast
 

1123
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,110
function to be fast this is very fast
right

1124
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
right
 

1125
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,789
right
it reduce the collision yeah maybe or

1126
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
it reduce the collision yeah maybe or
 

1127
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,549
it reduce the collision yeah maybe or
maybe not right

1128
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
maybe not right
 

1129
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,390
maybe not right
yeah

1130
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
yeah
 

1131
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,710
yeah
and then the third one which is what

1132
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
and then the third one which is what
 

1133
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,990
and then the third one which is what
ever struck uh

1134
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
ever struck uh
 

1135
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,789
ever struck uh
avalanche effect right does it it's not

1136
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
avalanche effect right does it it's not
 

1137
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,350
avalanche effect right does it it's not
right because look a different key like

1138
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
right because look a different key like
 

1139
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,789
right because look a different key like
if i give you a value 10.

1140
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799
if i give you a value 10.
 

1141
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,870
if i give you a value 10.
okay if i give my value 10 in here in

1142
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880
okay if i give my value 10 in here in
 

1143
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,510
okay if i give my value 10 in here in
this case it's stored at location 10. if

1144
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520
this case it's stored at location 10. if
 

1145
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,909
this case it's stored at location 10. if
i give you a

1146
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919

 

1147
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:14,950

look

1148
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
look
 

1149
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,669
look
slight change is the key

1150
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,679
slight change is the key
 

1151
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,990
slight change is the key
and they they give the similar values of

1152
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
and they they give the similar values of
 

1153
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,630
and they they give the similar values of
the hash value right

1154
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:22,640
the hash value right
 

1155
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,390
the hash value right
yeah we don't want that right this is

1156
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
yeah we don't want that right this is
 

1157
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,390
yeah we don't want that right this is
okay but then for demonstration purpose

1158
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
okay but then for demonstration purpose
 

1159
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,350
okay but then for demonstration purpose
this this is okay

1160
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
this this is okay
 

1161
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,149
this this is okay
okay now let's let's try this okay

1162
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
okay now let's let's try this okay
 

1163
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,350
okay now let's let's try this okay
define

1164
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
define
 

1165
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,310

we want to get key get value

1166
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,320
we want to get key get value
 

1167
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,190
we want to get key get value
a key right

1168
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,200
a key right
 

1169
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,190
a key right
so this is the key we're going to get

1170
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
so this is the key we're going to get
 

1171
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,350
so this is the key we're going to get
the key so first of all we want to do it

1172
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
the key so first of all we want to do it
 

1173
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,950
the key so first of all we want to do it
do what key equals what

1174
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
do what key equals what
 

1175
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,549
do what key equals what
get key right because we want to find

1176
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
get key right because we want to find
 

1177
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,390
get key right because we want to find
out where it is

1178
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
out where it is
 

1179
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,470
out where it is
and the first step is find out where

1180
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
and the first step is find out where
 

1181
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,870
and the first step is find out where
this key a key

1182
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:54,880
this key a key
 

1183
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,990
this key a key
is

1184
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,000
is
 

1185
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,070
is
in the hash table so you'll be get here

1186
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
in the hash table so you'll be get here
 

1187
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,830
in the hash table so you'll be get here
right we're calling this function

1188
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
right we're calling this function
 

1189
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,630
right we're calling this function
save the key a key

1190
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
save the key a key
 

1191
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,070
save the key a key
okay actually look because these are

1192
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
okay actually look because these are
 

1193
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,990
okay actually look because these are
actually in python you have to put the

1194
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
actually in python you have to put the
 

1195
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,990
actually in python you have to put the
first parameter self okay

1196
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,000
first parameter self okay
 

1197
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,190
first parameter self okay
just remember there will be a first

1198
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,200
just remember there will be a first
 

1199
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,350
just remember there will be a first
parameter too because these functions

1200
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
parameter too because these functions
 

1201
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,590
parameter too because these functions
are defined as the class methods so the

1202
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
are defined as the class methods so the
 

1203
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,830
are defined as the class methods so the
first parameter has to be safe

1204
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
first parameter has to be safe
 

1205
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,669
first parameter has to be safe
self what's safe

1206
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:19,679
self what's safe
 

1207
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,390
self what's safe
self destruct

1208
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,400

 

1209
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,149

belongs to hash table so you need to put

1210
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
belongs to hash table so you need to put
 

1211
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,710
belongs to hash table so you need to put
a hash okay i don't

1212
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
a hash okay i don't
 

1213
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,630
a hash okay i don't
you just remember that okay

1214
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
you just remember that okay
 

1215
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,310
you just remember that okay
now like this key

1216
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
now like this key
 

1217
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,630
now like this key
now suppose this key is here now we want

1218
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
now suppose this key is here now we want
 

1219
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,870
now suppose this key is here now we want
to iterate over these yeah

1220
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
to iterate over these yeah
 

1221
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,870
to iterate over these yeah
we don't need to uh iterate over this to

1222
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
we don't need to uh iterate over this to
 

1223
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,630
we don't need to uh iterate over this to
see if it

1224
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:40,640
see if it
 

1225
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,750
see if it
uh if there's a key equals a key right

1226
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:43,760
uh if there's a key equals a key right
 

1227
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,390
uh if there's a key equals a key right
so what kind of search

1228
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:46,400
so what kind of search
 

1229
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,710
so what kind of search
are we performing on the link on the

1230
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,720
are we performing on the link on the
 

1231
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,549
are we performing on the link on the
phone here what kind of search are we

1232
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
phone here what kind of search are we
 

1233
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,870
phone here what kind of search are we
performing here

1234
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:52,880
performing here
 

1235
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,510
performing here
we locate this is a key

1236
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
we locate this is a key
 

1237
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,190
we locate this is a key
linear search yeah we just go through

1238
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
linear search yeah we just go through
 

1239
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,630
linear search yeah we just go through
one by one and there's no better way

1240
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
one by one and there's no better way
 

1241
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,950
one by one and there's no better way
right because we're not sure unless

1242
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
right because we're not sure unless
 

1243
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,830
right because we're not sure unless
unless what unless you

1244
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:03,840
unless what unless you
 

1245
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,990
unless what unless you
unless you know this this is sorted in

1246
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
unless you know this this is sorted in
 

1247
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,549
unless you know this this is sorted in
in that case we can use what

1248
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:08,559
in that case we can use what
 

1249
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,990
in that case we can use what
if it's at least something how can we

1250
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
if it's at least something how can we
 

1251
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,830
if it's at least something how can we
find anime in the saudis we can use what

1252
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
find anime in the saudis we can use what
 

1253
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,710
find anime in the saudis we can use what
kind of agreement are we using remember

1254
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
kind of agreement are we using remember
 

1255
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,110
kind of agreement are we using remember
the one we always split into tough

1256
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,120
the one we always split into tough
 

1257
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,870
the one we always split into tough
binary final research yeah and also

1258
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
binary final research yeah and also
 

1259
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,269
binary final research yeah and also
okay good job okay good job good job

1260

come on sit there please
 

1265
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,630
come on sit there please
so here we can only use the linear

1266
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:30,640
so here we can only use the linear
 

1267
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,870
so here we can only use the linear
search so let's go to the

1268
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
search so let's go to the
 

1269
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,909
search so let's go to the
for

1270
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:33,919
for
 

1271
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,269
for

00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
in what
 

1277
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,549
in what
range

1278
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
range
 

1279
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,430
range
maybe now we are we are known save data

1280
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
maybe now we are we are known save data
 

1281
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,870
maybe now we are we are known save data
dot key right

1282
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
dot key right
 

1283
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:51,909
dot key right
flying key say self

1284
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:51,919

 

1285
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,669

okay so we go through this element and

1286
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:53,679
okay so we go through this element and
 

1287
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,230
okay so we go through this element and
we want to find out if i

1288
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
we want to find out if i
 

1289
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,310
we want to find out if i
the first one is the key the second one

1290
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,320
the first one is the key the second one
 

1291
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,190
the first one is the key the second one
is

1292
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
is
 

1293
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,350
is
look at the two part the first one is

1294
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
look at the two part the first one is
 

1295
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,950
look at the two part the first one is
the

1296
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:02,960
the
 

1297
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,870
the
actual key so if i zero equal or equal a

1298
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:06,880
actual key so if i zero equal or equal a
 

1299
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,990
actual key so if i zero equal or equal a
key right

1300
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
key right
 

1301
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,710
key right
equals to the original key

1302
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
equals to the original key
 

1303
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,549
equals to the original key
then we return

1304
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
then we return
 

1305
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,510
then we return
we return the value which is i one is

1306
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
we return the value which is i one is
 

1307
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,789
we return the value which is i one is
this value

1308
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
this value
 

1309
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,710
this value
even after this or you haven't found the

1310
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
even after this or you haven't found the
 

1311
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,870
even after this or you haven't found the
value then we return nothing all written

1312
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:20,880
value then we return nothing all written
 

1313
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,310
value then we return nothing all written
minus one okay

1314
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
minus one okay
 

1315
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,269
minus one okay
okay

1316
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,279
okay
 

1317
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,630
okay
yeah

1318
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:24,640
yeah
 

1319
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,350
yeah
doesn't make sense key first of all we

1320
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
doesn't make sense key first of all we
 

1321
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,110
doesn't make sense key first of all we
we we want to check the key it's this

1322
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
we we want to check the key it's this
 

1323
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,350
we we want to check the key it's this
place and this here could be every line

1324
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
place and this here could be every line
 

1325
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,029
place and this here could be every line
or whatever right and i need to follow

1326
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:33,039
or whatever right and i need to follow
 

1327
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,590
or whatever right and i need to follow
you one by one to to find out

1328
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
you one by one to to find out
 

1329
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,909
you one by one to to find out
it's actually the first one the keyboard

1330
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
it's actually the first one the keyboard
 

1331
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,390
it's actually the first one the keyboard
is the the original key

1332
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400
is the the original key
 

1333
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,430
is the the original key
and the value will be the value okay

1334
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
and the value will be the value okay
 

1335
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,269
and the value will be the value okay
okay so now we have to get and how about

1336
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279
okay so now we have to get and how about
 

1337
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,350
okay so now we have to get and how about
with update i just change here to update

1338
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360
with update i just change here to update
 

1339
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,510
with update i just change here to update
okay update

1340
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:49,520
okay update
 

1341
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,990
okay update
update update the key a key and a value

1342
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
update update the key a key and a value
 

1343
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,470
update update the key a key and a value
right we need a value yeah

1344
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:56,480

 

1345
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,750

so this is the same we get a key right

1346
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
so this is the same we get a key right
 

1347
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,149
so this is the same we get a key right
okay so what happened here

1348
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:02,159
okay so what happened here
 

1349
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,390
okay so what happened here
we go through the original list if laser

1350
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400
we go through the original list if laser
 

1351
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,750
we go through the original list if laser
element or if this key is already in the

1352
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:07,760
element or if this key is already in the
 

1353
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,990
element or if this key is already in the
element we just update the value right

1354
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
element we just update the value right
 

1355
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,830
element we just update the value right
otherwise we append it right all right

1356
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840
otherwise we append it right all right
 

1357
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,230
otherwise we append it right all right
do you get my point

1358
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:16,240
do you get my point
 

1359
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,230
do you get my point
so this update function

1360
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
so this update function
 

1361
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,950
so this update function
if the key is already existed in a hash

1362
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:20,960
if the key is already existed in a hash
 

1363
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,430
if the key is already existed in a hash
table we update the value yeah if it's

1364
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
table we update the value yeah if it's
 

1365
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,669
table we update the value yeah if it's
not existing what what do we do

1366
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:25,679
not existing what what do we do
 

1367
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,950
not existing what what do we do
we don't care no no no we put this new

1368
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960
we don't care no no no we put this new
 

1369
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,990
we don't care no no no we put this new
thing at the end of this list right

1370
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
thing at the end of this list right
 

1371
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,669
thing at the end of this list right
correct yeah

1372
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
correct yeah
 

1373
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,630
correct yeah
so look for i insert the key

1374
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
so look for i insert the key
 

1375
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,510
so look for i insert the key
if i zero equals a key then we don't

1376
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,520
if i zero equals a key then we don't
 

1377
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,470
if i zero equals a key then we don't
return it instead what what do we do

1378
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:42,480
return it instead what what do we do
 

1379
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,909
return it instead what what do we do
i one

1380
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
i one
 

1381
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,870
i one
equal equal value we update it and we

1382
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
equal equal value we update it and we
 

1383
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,549
equal equal value we update it and we
return here

1384
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,559
return here
 

1385
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,350
return here
okay and if not if

1386
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,360
okay and if not if
 

1387
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,630
okay and if not if
look

1388
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:52,640
look
 

1389
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,630
look
if at least here it means that the key

1390
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:54,640
if at least here it means that the key
 

1391
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,350
if at least here it means that the key
is not in the table so we just put

1392
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
is not in the table so we just put
 

1393
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,350
is not in the table so we just put
append it so say

1394
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
append it so say
 

1395
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,990
append it so say
dot data

1396
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
dot data
 

1397
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,789
dot data
key

1398
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:02,799
key
 

1399
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,909
key
right

1400
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:03,919
right
 

1401
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,070
right
a pen a pen can you tell me what what do

1402
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
a pen a pen can you tell me what what do
 

1403
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,549
a pen a pen can you tell me what what do
i append what do i print

1404
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:08,559
i append what do i print
 

1405
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,430
i append what do i print
a panorama a tuber what's tuba

1406
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
a panorama a tuber what's tuba
 

1407
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,870
a panorama a tuber what's tuba
a tuber another bracket

1408
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880
a tuber another bracket
 

1409
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,110
a tuber another bracket
what's the key of the tuber

1410
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
what's the key of the tuber
 

1411
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,669
what's the key of the tuber
a key right yeah what's the value

1412
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:21,679
a key right yeah what's the value
 

1413
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,269
a key right yeah what's the value
value here

1414
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:23,279
value here
 

1415
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,710
value here
yeah you see

1416
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
yeah you see
 

1417
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,470
yeah you see
if we find it

1418
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
if we find it
 

1419
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,630
if we find it
we change it to the value and we detect

1420
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:28,640
we change it to the value and we detect
 

1421
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,190
we change it to the value and we detect
if we don't find it we append one item

1422
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,200
if we don't find it we append one item
 

1423
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,310
if we don't find it we append one item
to the to the to the end of the list as

1424
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,320
to the to the to the end of the list as
 

1425
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,990
to the to the to the end of the list as
a key okay we move the last one remove

1426
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,000
a key okay we move the last one remove
 

1427
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,070
a key okay we move the last one remove
how do we remove it

1428
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
how do we remove it
 

1429
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,909
how do we remove it
how do we do move it we we don't

1430
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
how do we do move it we we don't
 

1431
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,230
how do we do move it we we don't
actually need to pass the variable here

1432
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
actually need to pass the variable here
 

1433
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,789
actually need to pass the variable here
value here we just remove a key

1434
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:46,799
value here we just remove a key
 

1435
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,549
value here we just remove a key
for i

1436
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:48,559
for i
 

1437
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,710
for i
how do we go for i if we found a key now

1438
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:50,720
how do we go for i if we found a key now
 

1439
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,389
how do we go for i if we found a key now
we found a key right

1440
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:52,399
we found a key right
 

1441
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,430
we found a key right
now

1442
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
now
 

1443
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,590
now
we we need to

1444
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600
we we need to
 

1445
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,070
we we need to
we we need to do what if we found a key

1446
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,080
we we need to do what if we found a key
 

1447
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,389
we we need to do what if we found a key
what should we do

1448
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:00,399
what should we do
 

1449
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,269
what should we do
um

1450
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:01,279
um
 

1451
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,669
um
so i

1452
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:05,679

 

1453
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,230

so actually uh

1454
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:10,240

 

1455
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,789

so look i is actually we we actually

1456
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799
so look i is actually we we actually
 

1457
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,750
so look i is actually we we actually
need to copy over right so if we we need

1458
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
need to copy over right so if we we need
 

1459
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,269
need to copy over right so if we we need
here we for i let's say range range

1460
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:19,279
here we for i let's say range range
 

1461
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,990
here we for i let's say range range
we're going through the index length

1462
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000
we're going through the index length
 

1463
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,590
we're going through the index length
length okay

1464
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
length okay
 

1465
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,710
length okay
so now we here would be i

1466
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:26,720
so now we here would be i
 

1467
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,430
so now we here would be i
said the data

1468
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
said the data
 

1469
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,029
said the data
theta i

1470
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:31,039
theta i
 

1471
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,750
theta i
zero if i zero is the key

1472
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
zero if i zero is the key
 

1473
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,029
zero if i zero is the key
then

1474
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:35,039
then
 

1475
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,950
then
we copy over the last one right theta i

1476
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:38,960
we copy over the last one right theta i
 

1477
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,070
we copy over the last one right theta i
what data i

1478
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080

 

1479
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,230

we copy over how do we copy over equals

1480
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
we copy over how do we copy over equals
 

1481
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,190
we copy over how do we copy over equals
theta

1482
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200

 

1483
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,190

uh

1484
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,200
uh
 

1485
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,310
uh
okay theta k i okay so okay so theta key

1486
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,320
okay theta k i okay so okay so theta key
 

1487
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,110
okay theta k i okay so okay so theta key
i

1488
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120
i
 

1489
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,950
i
first of all key i

1490
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:56,960
first of all key i
 

1491
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,990
first of all key i
key minus one yeah minus one is the last

1492
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000
key minus one yeah minus one is the last
 

1493
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,269
key minus one yeah minus one is the last
element right

1494
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
element right
 

1495
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,070
element right
and we we have to use this you know the

1496
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
and we we have to use this you know the
 

1497
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,149
and we we have to use this you know the
the deep copy and shadow yeah see copy

1498
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
the deep copy and shadow yeah see copy
 

1499
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,630
the deep copy and shadow yeah see copy
you copy um something from widget

1500
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640

 

1501
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,190

at least b equals a is this the deep

1502
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
at least b equals a is this the deep
 

1503
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,310
at least b equals a is this the deep
copy of shallow copy

1504
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,320

 

1505
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,549

a equals one to b equals a is it deep

1506
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:22,559
a equals one to b equals a is it deep
 

1507
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,710
a equals one to b equals a is it deep
copy of zero copy

1508
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:24,720
copy of zero copy
 

1509
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,990
copy of zero copy
share because this b is like areas so if

1510
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,000
share because this b is like areas so if
 

1511
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,269
share because this b is like areas so if
i say b 0 equals 10

1512
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
i say b 0 equals 10
 

1513
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,350
i say b 0 equals 10
so what's the value of a 0

1514
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360

 

1515
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,789

look here

1516
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
look here
 

1517
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,750
look here
b 0 is 10 you say it's yellow copy and

1518
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:39,760
b 0 is 10 you say it's yellow copy and
 

1519
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,230
b 0 is 10 you say it's yellow copy and
what's uh what's the area of a0 come on

1520
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
what's uh what's the area of a0 come on
 

1521
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,350
what's uh what's the area of a0 come on
can you tell me

1522
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
can you tell me
 

1523
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,870
can you tell me
a quiz

1524
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:44,880
a quiz
 

1525
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,269
a quiz
a is one two and b equals a and i said b

1526
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
a is one two and b equals a and i said b
 

1527
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,630
a is one two and b equals a and i said b
0 is 10

1528
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:48,640
0 is 10
 

1529
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,269
0 is 10
so what's the value of a 0.

1530
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:51,279
so what's the value of a 0.
 

1531
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,350
so what's the value of a 0.
come on you say shadow what's the

1532
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360
come on you say shadow what's the
 

1533
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,070
come on you say shadow what's the
10 yeah exactly it's a 10 because it's

1534
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,080
10 yeah exactly it's a 10 because it's
 

1535
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,310
10 yeah exactly it's a 10 because it's
what what it does is here look it's one

1536
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
what what it does is here look it's one
 

1537
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,590
what what it does is here look it's one
two right

1538
00:29:59,590 --> 00:29:59,600
two right
 

1539
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,310
two right
a is here right x points to here look

1540
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,320
a is here right x points to here look
 

1541
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,190
a is here right x points to here look
alright

1542
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,200
alright
 

1543
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,669
alright
shallow copy what does it mean so b

1544
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:05,679
shallow copy what does it mean so b
 

1545
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,510
shallow copy what does it mean so b
also points to the same place right if

1546
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:07,520
also points to the same place right if
 

1547
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,310
also points to the same place right if
you change the first element to 10

1548
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:10,320
you change the first element to 10
 

1549
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,549
you change the first element to 10
and you also change the value of a to 10

1550
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:12,559
and you also change the value of a to 10
 

1551
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,669
and you also change the value of a to 10
right

1552
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:13,679
right
 

1553
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,830
right
how about shallow deep copy how do you

1554
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:15,840
how about shallow deep copy how do you
 

1555
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,750
how about shallow deep copy how do you
do this a

1556
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,760
do this a
 

1557
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,470
do this a
yeah deep copy you can you can do

1558
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
yeah deep copy you can you can do
 

1559
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,470
yeah deep copy you can you can do
deep copy tip copy is what copy there's

1560
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:22,480
deep copy tip copy is what copy there's
 

1561
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,710
deep copy tip copy is what copy there's
a copy package copy dot d copy yeah you

1562
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,720
a copy package copy dot d copy yeah you
 

1563
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,350
a copy package copy dot d copy yeah you
can do this d copy and then you can say

1564
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,360
can do this d copy and then you can say
 

1565
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,269
can do this d copy and then you can say
b equals b equals copy dot d copy a okay

1566
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:31,279
b equals b equals copy dot d copy a okay
 

1567
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,630
b equals b equals copy dot d copy a okay
that's the d copy or you can do this b

1568
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:34,640
that's the d copy or you can do this b
 

1569
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:43,350
that's the d copy or you can do this b
equals

1570
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,360

 

1571
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,510

so in this case if what

1572
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,520
so in this case if what
 

1573
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,590
so in this case if what
what if i said b0 to 10 and what's the

1574
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:47,600
what if i said b0 to 10 and what's the
 

1575
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,669
what if i said b0 to 10 and what's the
value of a0 come on b zero is to ten and

1576
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:51,679
value of a0 come on b zero is to ten and
 

1577
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,070
value of a0 come on b zero is to ten and
what's a a zero if it's a d copy b is a

1578
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,080
what's a a zero if it's a d copy b is a
 

1579
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,870
what's a a zero if it's a d copy b is a
deep copy of a

1580
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880
deep copy of a
 

1581
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,509
deep copy of a
uh

1582
00:30:59,509 --> 00:30:59,519

 

1583
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,630

well

1584
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:00,640
well
 

1585
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,710
well
right two

1586
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:02,720
right two
 

1587
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,149
right two
shallow copy is 10 what's the d copy

1588
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:06,159
shallow copy is 10 what's the d copy
 

1589
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,430
shallow copy is 10 what's the d copy
you're not copy because you're not

1590
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
you're not copy because you're not
 

1591
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,029
you're not copy because you're not
actually copying you change one thing

1592
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:09,039
actually copying you change one thing
 

1593
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,830
actually copying you change one thing
you change for o right

1594
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
you change for o right
 

1595
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,509
you change for o right
one two and i change the first element

1596
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:13,519
one two and i change the first element
 

1597
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,870
one two and i change the first element
to ten

1598
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:14,880
to ten
 

1599
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,509
to ten
so what's the b what's the a zero

1600
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:17,519
so what's the b what's the a zero
 

1601
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,070
so what's the b what's the a zero
what's the a zero here is it

1602
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
what's the a zero here is it
 

1603
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,909
what's the a zero here is it
is it change

1604
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:21,919
is it change
 

1605
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,029
is it change
yeah one two it's not changing a0 is one

1606
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
yeah one two it's not changing a0 is one
 

1607
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,590
yeah one two it's not changing a0 is one
it's not changed right because b is a

1608
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:27,600
it's not changed right because b is a
 

1609
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,070
it's not changed right because b is a
copy of totally a deep copy of a

1610
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:30,080
copy of totally a deep copy of a
 

1611
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,230
copy of totally a deep copy of a
changing everything to b doesn't affect

1612
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,240
changing everything to b doesn't affect
 

1613
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,430
changing everything to b doesn't affect
a right

1614
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
a right
 

1615
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,909
a right
yeah it's like you you

1616
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
yeah it's like you you
 

1617
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,190
yeah it's like you you
eric you are cr no no ryan you are clone

1618
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,200
eric you are cr no no ryan you are clone
 

1619
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,630
eric you are cr no no ryan you are clone
of eric right yeah i'm a small client

1620
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:42,640
of eric right yeah i'm a small client
 

1621
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,110
of eric right yeah i'm a small client
yeah smaller acronym so

1622
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
yeah smaller acronym so
 

1623
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,909
yeah smaller acronym so
so

1624
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:45,919
so
 

1625
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,190
so
does it make sense yeah if you're

1626
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,200
does it make sense yeah if you're
 

1627
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,350
does it make sense yeah if you're
anything i i i

1628
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:49,360
anything i i i
 

1629
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,590
anything i i i
anything you finish your homework does

1630
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:51,600
anything you finish your homework does
 

1631
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,509
anything you finish your homework does
not mean that everyone finishes some

1632
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:53,519
not mean that everyone finishes some
 

1633
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,950
not mean that everyone finishes some
more right you are too different

1634
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
more right you are too different
 

1635
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,350
more right you are too different
independent right okay

1636
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,360
independent right okay
 

1637
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,710
independent right okay
make sense

1638
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
make sense
 

1639
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,029
make sense
okay so oh we are a little bit far away

1640
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
okay so oh we are a little bit far away
 

1641
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,070
okay so oh we are a little bit far away
ah so look we give copy and now we copy

1642
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
ah so look we give copy and now we copy
 

1643
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,669
ah so look we give copy and now we copy
over the last one so what what's the

1644
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679
over the last one so what what's the
 

1645
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,950
over the last one so what what's the
next one if i want to delete it

1646
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
next one if i want to delete it

if the key

1654
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:26,640
if the key
 

1655
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,710
if the key
we go

1656
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720

 

1657
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,149

and we find out

1658
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159
and we find out
 

1659
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,470
and we find out
if there's a key and then we remove it

1660
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:34,480
if there's a key and then we remove it
 

1661
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,070
if there's a key and then we remove it
and then we return yeah we do we just

1662
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,080
and then we return yeah we do we just
 

1663
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,870
and then we return yeah we do we just
return because we just remove one

1664
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:38,880
return because we just remove one
 

1665
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,470
return because we just remove one
that's it i usually know uh key and then

1666
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
that's it i usually know uh key and then
 

1667
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,230
that's it i usually know uh key and then
we'll just ignore it and it will be here

1668
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
we'll just ignore it and it will be here
 

1669
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,269
we'll just ignore it and it will be here
and we can

1670
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:45,279
and we can
 

1671
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,350
and we can
possibly we can say okay raise exception

1672
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
possibly we can say okay raise exception
 

1673
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,909
possibly we can say okay raise exception
here yeah raise exception

1674
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:49,919
here yeah raise exception
 

1675
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,029
here yeah raise exception
anyway

1676
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:51,039
anyway
 

1677
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,190
anyway
key not found okay whatever

1678
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
key not found okay whatever
 

1679
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,870
key not found okay whatever
right

1680
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:54,880
right
 

1681
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,669
right
okay

1682
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:55,679
okay
 

1683
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,230
okay
what have you learned so far today

1684
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,240

 

1685
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,870

what what are we trying to do here

1686
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:02,880
what what are we trying to do here
 

1687
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,310
what what are we trying to do here
hashtag designer hash table right

1688
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:06,320
hashtag designer hash table right
 

1689
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,310
hashtag designer hash table right
so in the hash table what's the most

1690
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
so in the hash table what's the most
 

1691
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,630
so in the hash table what's the most
important thing you can think of deep

1692
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:10,640
important thing you can think of deep
 

1693
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,230
important thing you can think of deep
clean

1694
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,240
clean
 

1695
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,950
clean
no

1696
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:12,960
no
 

1697
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,669
no
what's the most important thing we

1698
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
what's the most important thing we
 

1699
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,549
what's the most important thing we
which what's the most important thing

1700
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
which what's the most important thing
 

1701
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,070
which what's the most important thing
it doesn't change what's this key

1702
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,080
it doesn't change what's this key
 

1703
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,389
it doesn't change what's this key
hash function structure hash function

1704
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
hash function structure hash function
 

1705
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,470
hash function structure hash function
allows us to because this is important

1706
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:26,480
allows us to because this is important
 

1707
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,549
allows us to because this is important
if you've given this input key you want

1708
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559
if you've given this input key you want
 

1709
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,990
if you've given this input key you want
to find out where to put it right we

1710
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,000
to find out where to put it right we
 

1711
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,590
to find out where to put it right we
want it to be

1712
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:31,600
want it to be
 

1713
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,149
want it to be
as as far as possible right so they

1714
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:34,159
as as far as possible right so they
 

1715
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,350
as as far as possible right so they
don't

1716
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,360
don't
 

1717
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,149
don't
they don't collide each other yeah so

1718
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,159
they don't collide each other yeah so
 

1719
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,070
they don't collide each other yeah so
that will give us the

1720
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,080
that will give us the
 

1721
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,509
that will give us the
time complexity how how how cooking

1722
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:43,519
time complexity how how how cooking
 

1723
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,470
time complexity how how how cooking
oh what three operations

1724
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:46,480
oh what three operations
 

1725
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,110
oh what three operations
a one a one and a one all one right this

1726
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,120
a one a one and a one all one right this
 

1727
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,710
a one a one and a one all one right this
is the most of our

1728
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:50,720
is the most of our
 

1729
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,870
is the most of our
most big advantage of using hash table

1730
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:52,880
most big advantage of using hash table
 

1731
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,950
most big advantage of using hash table
right correct so just one last question

1732
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:56,960
right correct so just one last question
 

1733
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,430
right correct so just one last question
if a hash table is fixed size okay let's

1734
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440
if a hash table is fixed size okay let's
 

1735
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,830
if a hash table is fixed size okay let's
say it's fixed and if there are too many

1736
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
say it's fixed and if there are too many
 

1737
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,430
say it's fixed and if there are too many
elements

1738
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,440
elements
 

1739
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,990
elements
coming so it's coming to the hash table

1740
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,000
coming so it's coming to the hash table
 

1741
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,149
coming so it's coming to the hash table
what could happen the performance of the

1742
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:08,159
what could happen the performance of the
 

1743
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,149
what could happen the performance of the
hash table will be

1744
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:10,159
hash table will be
 

1745
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,990
hash table will be
will be decrease or increase

1746
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,000

 

1747
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,430

you'll be degree if there are too many

1748
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,440
you'll be degree if there are too many
 

1749
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,909
you'll be degree if there are too many
elements in in the hash table can you

1750
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:17,919
elements in in the hash table can you
 

1751
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:20,470
elements in in the hash table can you
imagine that the performance to

1752
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:20,480
imagine that the performance to
 

1753
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,829
imagine that the performance to
to look up

1754
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:21,839
to look up
 

1755
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,909
to look up
to remove to update

1756
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:23,919
to remove to update
 

1757
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,550
to remove to update
will be slower or faster

1758
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:28,560

 

1759
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,349

come on be confident

1760
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:31,359
come on be confident
 

1761
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,349
come on be confident
the more elements in the hash table

1762
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:33,359
the more elements in the hash table
 

1763
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,470
the more elements in the hash table
there will be more chance of what faster

1764
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:36,480
there will be more chance of what faster
 

1765
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,030
there will be more chance of what faster
more chance of work come on

1766
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,040
more chance of work come on
 

1767
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,190
more chance of work come on
your fixed size come on

1768
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,200
your fixed size come on
 

1769
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,349
your fixed size come on
this is a hash table

1770
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:43,359
this is a hash table
 

1771
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,909
this is a hash table
only three people if another your friend

1772
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
only three people if another your friend
 

1773
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,669
only three people if another your friend
are coming what happened

1774
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:47,679
are coming what happened
 

1775
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,510
are coming what happened
too cloudy what happened in hash table

1776
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:49,520
too cloudy what happened in hash table
 

1777
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,589
too cloudy what happened in hash table
it'd be too cloudy as well slow you'll

1778
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:51,599
it'd be too cloudy as well slow you'll
 

1779
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,030
it'd be too cloudy as well slow you'll
be slow because the hashing functions

1780
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,040
be slow because the hashing functions
 

1781
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,190
be slow because the hashing functions
how do you get loads of traffic lots of

1782
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,200
how do you get loads of traffic lots of
 

1783
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,030
how do you get loads of traffic lots of
traffic because of the con

1784
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,040
traffic because of the con
 

1785
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,950
traffic because of the con
like collision yeah what do we talk

1786
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:58,960
like collision yeah what do we talk
 

1787
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,510
like collision yeah what do we talk
about collision because look if too many

1788
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,520
about collision because look if too many
 

1789
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,270
about collision because look if too many
elements and there will be all fear yeah

1790
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,280
elements and there will be all fear yeah
 

1791
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,589
elements and there will be all fear yeah
the table will be much much weird

1792
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:05,599
the table will be much much weird
 

1793
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,910
the table will be much much weird
and if any more comes comes in what will

1794
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
and if any more comes comes in what will
 

1795
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,030
and if any more comes comes in what will
happen

1796
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,040
happen
 

1797
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,310
happen
it has to be

1798
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
it has to be
 

1799
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,990
it has to be
put in the hash table right so it could

1800
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,000
put in the hash table right so it could
 

1801
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,829
put in the hash table right so it could
be somewhere in the link list right all

1802
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:13,839
be somewhere in the link list right all
 

1803
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,030
be somewhere in the link list right all
right

1804
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,040
right
 

1805
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,310
right
does doesn't make sense right look at me

1806
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:18,320
does doesn't make sense right look at me
 

1807
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,510
does doesn't make sense right look at me
so look

1808
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,520
so look
 

1809
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,390
so look
if this hash table is pretty much filled

1810
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,400
if this hash table is pretty much filled
 

1811
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,109
if this hash table is pretty much filled
then the operation to search

1812
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:25,119
then the operation to search
 

1813
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,589
then the operation to search
could be very slow because look this bit

1814
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:27,599
could be very slow because look this bit
 

1815
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,589
could be very slow because look this bit
could be very large at least yeah this

1816
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
could be very large at least yeah this
 

1817
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,310
could be very large at least yeah this
could be a very large list even you

1818
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:32,320
could be a very large list even you
 

1819
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,550
could be a very large list even you
separate using the h key

1820
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:34,560
separate using the h key
 

1821
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,430
separate using the h key
but you still have to do this in linear

1822
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,440
but you still have to do this in linear
 

1823
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,030
but you still have to do this in linear
time yeah to look for these elements

1824
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,040
time yeah to look for these elements
 

1825
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,870
time yeah to look for these elements
in the linked list so that will slow it

1826
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:42,880
in the linked list so that will slow it
 

1827
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,390
in the linked list so that will slow it
down we don't want to happen right

1828
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
down we don't want to happen right
 

1829
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,390
down we don't want to happen right
that's why we we can have a bigger hash

1830
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,400
that's why we we can have a bigger hash
 

1831
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,670
that's why we we can have a bigger hash
table

1832
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
table
 

1833
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,470
table
yeah bigger hex table a better hash key

1834
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:50,480
yeah bigger hex table a better hash key
 

1835
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,630
yeah bigger hex table a better hash key
to distributing the keys

1836
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:52,640
to distributing the keys
 

1837
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,510
to distributing the keys
evenly everywhere in the enhanced in the

1838
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:55,520
evenly everywhere in the enhanced in the
 

1839
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,630
evenly everywhere in the enhanced in the
table right

1840
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640
table right
 

1841
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,190
table right
so that will give us the o1 constant

1842
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,200
so that will give us the o1 constant
 

1843
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,190
so that will give us the o1 constant
nearly impressively very fast one

1844
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,200

yeah different pages got it
 

1919
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,230
yeah different pages got it
okay that's a good way of thinking very

okay that's a good way of thinking very
 

1921
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,390
okay that's a good way of thinking very
well i haven't saw it that way but it's

the key is also on page three what
 

1953
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,150
the key is also on page three what
happened if there are too many items on

1954
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,160
happened if there are too many items on
 

1955
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,990
happened if there are too many items on
page three what happened you still have

1956

page three what happened you still have
 

1957
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,790
page three what happened you still have
to

1958
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:04,800
to
 

1959
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,790
to
look through this

1960
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:06,800
look through this
 

1961
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,030
look through this
yeah you get it you still have to

1962
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,040
yeah you get it you still have to
 

1963
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,190
yeah you get it you still have to
breathe through the page three right to

1964
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,200
breathe through the page three right to
 

1965
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,750
breathe through the page three right to
find out where it's airing right so that

1966
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:13,760
find out where it's airing right so that
 

1967
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,270
find out where it's airing right so that
would slow you down

1968
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,280
would slow you down
 

1969
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,430
would slow you down
okay right now slow you down am i right

1970
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:17,440
okay right now slow you down am i right
 

1971
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,950
okay right now slow you down am i right
doesn't make sense

1972
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
doesn't make sense
 

1973
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,430
doesn't make sense
you you now understand the concept of

1974
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:21,440
you you now understand the concept of
 

1975
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,190
you you now understand the concept of
this yeah hashtag

1976
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,200
