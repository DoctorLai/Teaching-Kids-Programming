1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,669

hello hello eric are you right

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
hello hello eric are you right
 

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,550
hello hello eric are you right
yeah okay so today we're going to talk

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:06,560
yeah okay so today we're going to talk
 

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,230
yeah okay so today we're going to talk
about diagnose of a

6
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
about diagnose of a
 

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,390
about diagnose of a
square metric so what's square matrix

8
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
square metric so what's square matrix
 

9
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,430
square metric so what's square matrix
like one two

10
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
like one two
 

11
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,830
like one two
three four if there are four columns and

12
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:13,840
three four if there are four columns and
 

13
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,789
three four if there are four columns and
there'll be four

14
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
there'll be four
 

15
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,150
there'll be four
rows yeah five six seven eight

16
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,160
rows yeah five six seven eight
 

17
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,510
rows yeah five six seven eight
zero one two three three zero one two

18
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
zero one two three three zero one two
 

19
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,150
zero one two three three zero one two
okay

20
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,160
okay
 

21
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,670
okay
so four square

22
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
so four square
 

23
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,750
so four square
square metric

24
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760

 

25
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,190

if there are n columns so there should

26
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,200
if there are n columns so there should
 

27
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,830
if there are n columns so there should
be n rows okay

28
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840
be n rows okay
 

29
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,110
be n rows okay
i want to calculate the sum

30
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
i want to calculate the sum
 

31
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,549
i want to calculate the sum
the sum of diagonals

32
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559

 

33
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,189

so how many how many numbers are there

34
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
so how many how many numbers are there
 

35
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,229
so how many how many numbers are there
16. yeah how many diagonals are there

36
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
16. yeah how many diagonals are there
 

37
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,900
16. yeah how many diagonals are there
how many diagonals in this case

38
00:00:59,900 --> 00:00:59,910

 

39
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,750

[Music]

40
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760

 

41
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,109

how many how many numbers are on the

42
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
how many how many numbers are on the
 

43
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,550
how many how many numbers are on the
diagonals

44
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
diagonals
 

45
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,710
diagonals
eight yeah eight so just some of these

46
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
eight yeah eight so just some of these
 

47
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,830
eight yeah eight so just some of these
values

48
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
values
 

49
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,870
values
simple this is even at f4

50
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
simple this is even at f4
 

51
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,070
simple this is even at f4
and how about the odd number like one

52
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
and how about the odd number like one
 

53
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,350
and how about the odd number like one
two three

54
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
two three
 

55
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,030
two three
four five six seven eight nine

56
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
four five six seven eight nine
 

57
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,510
four five six seven eight nine
so how many odd numbers left

58
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520

 

59
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,830

how many how many diagonals number there

60
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
how many how many diagonals number there
 

61
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,109
how many how many diagonals number there
and five five so they are five

62
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
and five five so they are five
 

63
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,990
and five five so they are five
yeah and there are eight here so eight

64
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
yeah and there are eight here so eight
 

65
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,630
yeah and there are eight here so eight
equals

66
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
equals
 

67
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,910
equals
two times four at least three yeah

68
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
two times four at least three yeah
 

69
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,149
two times four at least three yeah
so if it's even number is two times

70
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
so if it's even number is two times
 

71
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,389
so if it's even number is two times
three minus one why do we need to minus

72
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
three minus one why do we need to minus
 

73
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,830
three minus one why do we need to minus
one

74
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
one
 

75
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,710
one
because we go across and mean yeah we go

76
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
because we go across and mean yeah we go
 

77
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,149
because we go across and mean yeah we go
across if we times two we need to

78
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159

 

79
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,149

subtract one yeah because this number is

80
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
subtract one yeah because this number is
 

81
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,270
subtract one yeah because this number is
counted twice

82
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,280
counted twice
 

83
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,789
counted twice
right correct yeah

84
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
right correct yeah
 

85
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,230
right correct yeah
okay so how can we do this easy right

86
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
okay so how can we do this easy right
 

87
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,910
okay so how can we do this easy right
so we just need to sum up the numbers

88
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
so we just need to sum up the numbers
 

89
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,390
so we just need to sum up the numbers
yeah but pay attention to these if it's

90
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
yeah but pay attention to these if it's
 

91
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,830
yeah but pay attention to these if it's
in the middle

92
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
in the middle
 

93
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,990
in the middle
if it's in the middle then we only need

94
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
if it's in the middle then we only need
 

95
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,309
if it's in the middle then we only need
to calculate at once right

96
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
to calculate at once right
 

97
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,470
to calculate at once right
so look if we if this is n

98
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
so look if we if this is n
 

99
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,750
so look if we if this is n
if this is n we iterate

100
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
if this is n we iterate
 

101
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,430
if this is n we iterate
range range let's do a range i

102
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
range range let's do a range i
 

103
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,350
range range let's do a range i
in range n yeah

104
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
in range n yeah
 

105
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,309
in range n yeah
so what's the index of these these

106
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
so what's the index of these these
 

107
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,790
so what's the index of these these
diagonals

108
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
diagonals
 

109
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,790
diagonals
what's the index how do we if this

110
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
what's the index how do we if this
 

111
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,550
what's the index how do we if this
matrix is m

112
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
matrix is m
 

113
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,390
matrix is m
how can we access this number here

114
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400

 

115
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,150

and zero zero because it's two

116
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
and zero zero because it's two
 

117
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,030
and zero zero because it's two
dimensional yeah and here

118
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
dimensional yeah and here
 

119
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,710
dimensional yeah and here
one one yeah and one one etc okay

120
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
one one yeah and one one etc okay
 

121
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,229
one one yeah and one one etc okay
so if n is from zero to n minus one yes

122
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
so if n is from zero to n minus one yes
 

123
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:58,710
so if n is from zero to n minus one yes
so it's

124
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
so it's
 

125
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,470
so it's
m i i right okay

126
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
m i i right okay
 

127
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,110
m i i right okay
yeah so these columns is mii

128
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
yeah so these columns is mii
 

129
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,869
yeah so these columns is mii
and how about this

130
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879

 

131
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,990

i is the row so if i'm here so it should

132
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
i is the row so if i'm here so it should
 

133
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,110
i is the row so if i'm here so it should
be here right

134
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
be here right
 

135
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,470
be here right
so it's the mirror remember let me know

136
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
so it's the mirror remember let me know
 

137
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,030
so it's the mirror remember let me know
right if there are n so what's the

138
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
right if there are n so what's the
 

139
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,550
right if there are n so what's the
coordinate of this

140
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560

 

141
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,190

n minus one minus i right remember it's

142
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
n minus one minus i right remember it's
 

143
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,149
n minus one minus i right remember it's
like the reverse

144
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
like the reverse
 

145
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,190
like the reverse
mirror yeah all right

146
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
mirror yeah all right
 

147
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,710
mirror yeah all right
look if here i want to calculate this

148
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
look if here i want to calculate this
 

149
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,309
look if here i want to calculate this
the i is one right i want this

150
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
the i is one right i want this
 

151
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,030
the i is one right i want this
two right zero one two how how do you

152
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
two right zero one two how how do you
 

153
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,550
two right zero one two how how do you
come up with two

154
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
come up with two
 

155
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,630
come up with two
four minus one minus one right okay yeah

156
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
four minus one minus one right okay yeah
 

157
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,070
four minus one minus one right okay yeah
and if i is here it should be here

158
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
and if i is here it should be here
 

159
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,270
and if i is here it should be here
four minus one minus two is one

160
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
four minus one minus two is one
 

161
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,509
four minus one minus two is one
okay and here i is three

162
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
okay and here i is three
 

163
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,670
okay and here i is three
four minus one minus three is zero okay

164
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
four minus one minus three is zero okay
 

165
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,229
four minus one minus three is zero okay
so using this formula you always find

166
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
so using this formula you always find
 

167
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,589
so using this formula you always find
the corresponding

168
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
the corresponding
 

169
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,110
the corresponding
image location so it's

170
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
image location so it's
 

171
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,229
image location so it's
so i we want to add m i i plus

172
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
so i we want to add m i i plus
 

173
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,909
so i we want to add m i i plus
m i and minus i minus 1

174
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919

 

175
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,949

yeah but if if n

176
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
yeah but if if n
 

177
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,629
yeah but if if n
minus i minus i my minus 1 minus i

178
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
minus i minus i my minus 1 minus i
 

179
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,990
minus i minus i my minus 1 minus i
is equals to i we don't we we don't

180
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,000
is equals to i we don't we we don't
 

181
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,110
is equals to i we don't we we don't
add it right because it will be the case

182
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
add it right because it will be the case
 

183
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,950
add it right because it will be the case
in the middle you can't add the number

184
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
in the middle you can't add the number
 

185
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,710
in the middle you can't add the number
twice okay

186
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
twice okay
 

187
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,950
twice okay
easy yeah fine work yeah easy

188
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
easy yeah fine work yeah easy
 

189
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,790
easy yeah fine work yeah easy
define diagonal

190
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800

 

191
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,629

sum metric m

192
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
sum metric m
 

193
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,310
sum metric m
so we want to get n n equals length m

194
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
so we want to get n n equals length m
 

195
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,430
so we want to get n n equals length m
and if n is only one what does it mean

196
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
and if n is only one what does it mean
 

197
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,350
and if n is only one what does it mean
return one if there's only one element

198
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
return one if there's only one element
 

199
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,189
return one if there's only one element
yeah we only return m zero zero okay

200
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
yeah we only return m zero zero okay
 

201
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,870
yeah we only return m zero zero okay
yeah that's diagonal it's only one

202
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
yeah that's diagonal it's only one
 

203
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,310
yeah that's diagonal it's only one
number then

204
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
number then
 

205
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,150
number then
answer equals zero right four

206
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
answer equals zero right four
 

207
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,870
answer equals zero right four
i in range range one

208
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880

 

209
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,350

um two n twenty n yes

210
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
um two n twenty n yes
 

211
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,350
um two n twenty n yes
okay then i want first of all i want to

212
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
okay then i want first of all i want to
 

213
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,550
okay then i want first of all i want to
add the number answer

214
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
add the number answer
 

215
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,070
add the number answer
plus equals one answer plus

216
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
plus equals one answer plus
 

217
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,150
plus equals one answer plus
equals and i what

218
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
equals and i what
 

219
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,590
equals and i what
i i i yeah

220
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
i i i yeah
 

221
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,510
i i i yeah
okay and then i i need to calculate the

222
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
okay and then i i need to calculate the
 

223
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,029
okay and then i i need to calculate the
the opposite let's say j

224
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
the opposite let's say j
 

225
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,670
the opposite let's say j
equals n minus i minus one right

226
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
equals n minus i minus one right
 

227
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,189
equals n minus i minus one right
if one if

228
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
if one if
 

229
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,189
if one if
look this here i'm calculating here

230
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
look this here i'm calculating here
 

231
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,230
look this here i'm calculating here
here is i right here it's i and then

232
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
here is i right here it's i and then
 

233
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,550
here is i right here it's i and then
it's

234
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
it's
 

235
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,909
it's
it's image part is here is

236
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
it's image part is here is
 

237
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,189
it's image part is here is
n minus y one minus i is j

238
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
n minus y one minus i is j
 

239
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,990
n minus y one minus i is j
j is here right this is the diagonal of

240
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
j is here right this is the diagonal of
 

241
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,469
j is here right this is the diagonal of
this

242
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
this
 

243
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,029
this
yeah i want to add this number yeah and

244
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
yeah i want to add this number yeah and
 

245
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,469
yeah i want to add this number yeah and
my eye is in this number right

246
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
my eye is in this number right
 

247
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,790
my eye is in this number right
answer plus this is these are these ones

248
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
answer plus this is these are these ones
 

249
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,790
answer plus this is these are these ones
where i want to add this

250
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
where i want to add this
 

251
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,110
where i want to add this
only if this point is not the same as

252
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
only if this point is not the same as
 

253
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,390
only if this point is not the same as
this point if it's the same it's going

254
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
this point if it's the same it's going
 

255
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,710
this point if it's the same it's going
to be

256
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
to be
 

257
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:44,160
to be
right

258
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,170

 

259

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,990
[Music]
um

262
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
um
 

263
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,230
um
and yeah what's the space complexity

264
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240

 

265
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,870

usually that's really good okay

266
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
usually that's really good okay
 

267
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,629
usually that's really good okay
okay that's it right now nothing

268
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
okay that's it right now nothing
 

269
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,670
okay that's it right now nothing
no b come on come on it's

270
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
no b come on come on it's
 

271
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,589
no b come on come on it's
easy you want to add these and at least

272
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
easy you want to add these and at least
 

273
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,670
easy you want to add these and at least
and only at least if it's not the same

274
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
and only at least if it's not the same
 

275
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,550
and only at least if it's not the same
as the left one

276
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
as the left one
 

277
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,469
as the left one
okay you can do it i trust this

278
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479

 

279
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:28,790

answer plus equal one um

280
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800

 

281
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,390

yeah the first coating i is the row j

282
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
yeah the first coating i is the row j
 

283
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:52,790
yeah the first coating i is the row j
yeah okay yeah

284
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800

 

285
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,309

look that's i this whole pie is n

286
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
look that's i this whole pie is n
 

287
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,790
look that's i this whole pie is n
so what's this yeah correct

288
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
so what's this yeah correct
 

289
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,990
so what's this yeah correct
so look here is j he's

290
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
so look here is j he's
 

291
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,510
so look here is j he's
here and here is i i want how big is

292
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
here and here is i i want how big is
 

293
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,350
here and here is i i want how big is
this

294
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
this
 

295
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:19,990
this
um

296
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000

 

297
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,230

minus one minus

298
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240

 

299
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,150

minus i and you need to minus one minus

300
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
minus i and you need to minus one minus
 

301
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,589
minus i and you need to minus one minus
one okay and if i not equal

302
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
one okay and if i not equal
 

303
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,829
one okay and if i not equal
yeah if i know equals j

304
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
yeah if i know equals j
 

305
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:50,550
yeah if i know equals j
that will happen

306
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560

 

307
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,790

oh that's okay yes the shooter code is

308
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
oh that's okay yes the shooter code is
 

309
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,350
oh that's okay yes the shooter code is
okay

310
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360

 

311
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,230

as long as you know how do you get it

312
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
as long as you know how do you get it
 

313
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,110

what does it mean
 

321
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:32,430
what does it mean
what happened if i equals

322
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,440
