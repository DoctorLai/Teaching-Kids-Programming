00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,870

go hi hello hello mr mr ryan how are you

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:04,880
go hi hello hello mr mr ryan how are you
 

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,990
go hi hello hello mr mr ryan how are you
today

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:06,000
today
 

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,749
today
good okay so today we'll talk about an

6
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
good okay so today we'll talk about an
 

7
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,070
good okay so today we'll talk about an
interesting problem which is called

8
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
interesting problem which is called
 

9
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,509
interesting problem which is called
zero zero

10
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
zero zero
 

11
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,390
zero zero
so given a positive positive number

12
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
so given a positive positive number
 

13
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,230
so given a positive positive number
integer n

14
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
integer n
 

15
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,510
integer n
find a way find a ask to return an array

16
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
find a way find a ask to return an array
 

17
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,470
find a way find a ask to return an array
which contains

18
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
which contains
 

19
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,269
which contains
integer let's sum up to zero but this

20
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
integer let's sum up to zero but this
 

21
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,509
integer let's sum up to zero but this
integer has to be different unique

22
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:27,519
integer has to be different unique
 

23
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,029
integer has to be different unique
so basically two requirements

24
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
so basically two requirements
 

25
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,790
so basically two requirements
requirement why is

26
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
requirement why is
 

27
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,950
requirement why is
all integers unique

28
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:34,960
all integers unique
 

29
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,030
all integers unique
okay you can only use one integer once

30
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
okay you can only use one integer once
 

31
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,830
okay you can only use one integer once
and all integers second requirements sum

32
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
and all integers second requirements sum
 

33
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,069
and all integers second requirements sum
to zero

34
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
to zero
 

35
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,549
to zero
okay okay another certain equipment use

36
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
okay okay another certain equipment use
 

37
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,150
okay okay another certain equipment use
an integer okay

38
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,160

 

39
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,350

so if n equals one can you find a way

40
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
so if n equals one can you find a way
 

41
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,029
so if n equals one can you find a way
which

42
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
which
 

43
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,150
which
uh satisfy these three requirements

44
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
uh satisfy these three requirements
 

45
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,869
uh satisfy these three requirements
actually there's only one array zero

46
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
actually there's only one array zero
 

47
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:01,189
actually there's only one array zero
yeah

48
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
yeah
 

49
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,789
yeah
yeah okay when n equals two

50
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799
yeah okay when n equals two
 

51
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,830
yeah okay when n equals two
can you find an array um

52
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:10,840

 

53
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,870

one

54
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
one
 

55
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,990
one
once you make sure is one and one minus

56
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
once you make sure is one and one minus
 

57
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,390
once you make sure is one and one minus
one

58
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
one
 

59
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,630
one
yes so how many how many kind of

60
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
yes so how many how many kind of
 

61
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,950
yes so how many how many kind of
possibilities

62
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
possibilities
 

63
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,310
possibilities
for this answer uh

64
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
for this answer uh
 

65
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,590
for this answer uh
is it unique you can you hop there one

66
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
is it unique you can you hop there one
 

67
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,230
is it unique you can you hop there one
if n is one only one possibility and

68
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
if n is one only one possibility and
 

69
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,789
if n is one only one possibility and
when n

70
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
when n
 

71
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,429
when n
is two or any what was it how many

72
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
is two or any what was it how many
 

73
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,270
is two or any what was it how many
possibilities

74
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280

 

75
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,749

how many can you find any other man

76
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
how many can you find any other man
 

77
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,590
how many can you find any other man
these two

78
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
these two
 

79
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,789
these two
can you find this

80
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:44,799

 

81
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,990

one come see two

82
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
one come see two
 

83
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,990
one come see two
minus three yeah so you can find i

84
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
minus three yeah so you can find i
 

85
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,670
minus three yeah so you can find i
limited one right

86
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
limited one right
 

87
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,870
limited one right
okay what does that mean

88
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
okay what does that mean
 

89
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,830
okay what does that mean
minus one one minus one so you find two

90
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
minus one one minus one so you find two
 

91
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,830
minus one one minus one so you find two
numbers added to zero

92
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
numbers added to zero
 

93
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,670
numbers added to zero
right and all these two numbers needs to

94
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
right and all these two numbers needs to
 

95
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,230
right and all these two numbers needs to
be different yeah it's easier one

96
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,240
be different yeah it's easier one
 

97
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,190
be different yeah it's easier one
minus one yeah it will be zero two minus

98
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
minus one yeah it will be zero two minus
 

99
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,749
minus one yeah it will be zero two minus
two

100
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
two
 

101
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,869
two
you can say three minus two yeah yeah

102
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
you can say three minus two yeah yeah
 

103
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,910
you can say three minus two yeah yeah
okay how about n equals three

104
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
okay how about n equals three
 

105
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,070
okay how about n equals three
uh three zero zero

106
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
uh three zero zero
 

107
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,550
uh three zero zero
one minus one yeah you see so when n

108
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
one minus one yeah you see so when n
 

109
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,750
one minus one yeah you see so when n
is in odd number see if you first put a

110
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
is in odd number see if you first put a
 

111
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,030
is in odd number see if you first put a
zero right

112
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
zero right
 

113
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,670
zero right
yeah and then you'll be reduced to n

114
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
yeah and then you'll be reduced to n
 

115
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,030
yeah and then you'll be reduced to n
equals two right

116
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
equals two right
 

117
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,070
equals two right
all right okay so this is

118
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
all right okay so this is
 

119
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,430
all right okay so this is
one kind of strategy yeah so what how

120
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
one kind of strategy yeah so what how
 

121
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,790
one kind of strategy yeah so what how
can you think of alex strategies

122
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
can you think of alex strategies
 

123
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,190
can you think of alex strategies
like if n equals a hundred so what do

124
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
like if n equals a hundred so what do
 

125
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,670
like if n equals a hundred so what do
you put that will take for ages to write

126
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
you put that will take for ages to write
 

127
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,790
you put that will take for ages to write
yeah but you can always write it

128
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
yeah but you can always write it
 

129
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,270
yeah but you can always write it
generally it's a hundred numbers i give

130
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
generally it's a hundred numbers i give
 

131
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,670
generally it's a hundred numbers i give
you 100 minus one

132
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
you 100 minus one
 

133
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,229
you 100 minus one
minus t minus three minus four

134
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239

 

135
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,790

and then how do you put it minus minus

136
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
and then how do you put it minus minus
 

137
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,270
and then how do you put it minus minus
nine

138
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
nine
 

139
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,110
nine
minus ten okay

140
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120

 

141
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,509

so n equals a hundred i give you a hint

142
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
so n equals a hundred i give you a hint
 

143
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,670
so n equals a hundred i give you a hint
how about that's generally the first 99

144
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
how about that's generally the first 99
 

145
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,509
how about that's generally the first 99
number in the sequence and then we can

146
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
number in the sequence and then we can
 

147
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,350
number in the sequence and then we can
calculate the last number

148
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
calculate the last number
 

149
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,390
calculate the last number
so can you find a sequence

150
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,400
so can you find a sequence
 

151
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,949
so can you find a sequence
any pattern yeah yeah any pattern how do

152
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
any pattern yeah yeah any pattern how do
 

153
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,270
any pattern yeah yeah any pattern how do
you generate the first

154
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
you generate the first
 

155
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,990
you generate the first
one yeah you can start from zero as well

156
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
one yeah you can start from zero as well
 

157
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,509
one yeah you can start from zero as well
yellow

158
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
yellow
 

159
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,750
yellow
one nine one keep doing two is it

160
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
one nine one keep doing two is it
 

161
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,949
one nine one keep doing two is it
different right

162
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
different right
 

163
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,750
different right
and you get 98 and then after this you

164
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
and you get 98 and then after this you
 

165
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,070
and you get 98 and then after this you
know

166
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
know
 

167
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,190
know
the sum of the first 99 numbers right

168
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
the sum of the first 99 numbers right
 

169
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,830
the sum of the first 99 numbers right
and then you put it you put the negative

170
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
and then you put it you put the negative
 

171
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,390
and then you put it you put the negative
to that

172
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
to that
 

173
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,789
to that
right and all you can guarantee all

174
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
right and all you can guarantee all
 

175
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,229
right and all you can guarantee all
these numbers are different

176
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
these numbers are different
 

177
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,550
these numbers are different
and they sum up to zero right does it

178
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
and they sum up to zero right does it
 

179
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,430
and they sum up to zero right does it
make sense

180
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
make sense
 

181
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,750
make sense
okay so let's try the first solution

182
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
okay so let's try the first solution
 

183
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,110
okay so let's try the first solution
okay should be

184
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
okay should be
 

185
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,470
okay should be
easy uh where's my eraser the end of the

186
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
easy uh where's my eraser the end of the
 

187
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,070
easy uh where's my eraser the end of the
first line

188
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
first line
 

189
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,350
first line
when we started yeah but we can write to

190
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
when we started yeah but we can write to
 

191
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,110
when we started yeah but we can write to
number two if you want okay

192
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
number two if you want okay
 

193
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,670
number two if you want okay
so this is just the way to generate this

194
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
so this is just the way to generate this
 

195
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,390
so this is just the way to generate this
and

196
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
and
 

197
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,869
and
array of any integer unique integer

198
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
array of any integer unique integer
 

199
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,830
array of any integer unique integer
let's sum up to zero okay so let's say

200
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840

 

201
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,270

defined

202
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280

 

203
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,590

so let's say this number starts from the

204
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
so let's say this number starts from the
 

205
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,790
so let's say this number starts from the
first one right

206
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
first one right
 

207
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,030
first one right
yeah and then we put this answer put the

208
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
yeah and then we put this answer put the
 

209
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,270
yeah and then we put this answer put the
number in the answer right

210
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
number in the answer right
 

211
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,030
number in the answer right
at the beginning is empty empty this

212
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
at the beginning is empty empty this
 

213
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,030
at the beginning is empty empty this
yeah

214
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
yeah
 

215
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,270
yeah
so wire while

216
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
so wire while
 

217
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,830
so wire while
i want to put one minus one two minus

218
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
i want to put one minus one two minus
 

219
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,870
i want to put one minus one two minus
two so if

220
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
two so if
 

221
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,030
two so if
x naught is bigger than two right be

222
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
x naught is bigger than two right be
 

223
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,550
x naught is bigger than two right be
gone the thingy

224
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
gone the thingy
 

225
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,189
gone the thingy
and then minus the thingy right look so

226
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
and then minus the thingy right look so
 

227
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,390
and then minus the thingy right look so
what should i put here

228
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
what should i put here
 

229
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,510
what should i put here
when n when they are more than t

230
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
when n when they are more than t
 

231
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,990
when n when they are more than t
two or at least two then what should we

232
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
two or at least two then what should we
 

233
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,749
two or at least two then what should we
put to the answer

234
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
put to the answer
 

235
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:09,029
put to the answer
a penguin

236
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039

 

237
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,749

and then when i use the i i need to do

238
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
and then when i use the i i need to do
 

239
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,350
and then when i use the i i need to do
one

240
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
one
 

241
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,350
one
i one i is one the next one is one

242
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
i one i is one the next one is one
 

243
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,710
i one i is one the next one is one
uh well now i

244
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
uh well now i
 

245
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,430
uh well now i
is one and i want to in the next turn i

246
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
is one and i want to in the next turn i
 

247
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,950
is one and i want to in the next turn i
will be

248
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
will be
 

249
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,990
will be
2 2 so what i what

250
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
2 2 so what i what
 

251
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,189
2 2 so what i what
add at equals 1 right

252
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
add at equals 1 right
 

253
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,510
add at equals 1 right
now i i use two numbers so what happened

254
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
now i i use two numbers so what happened
 

255
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,110
now i i use two numbers so what happened
to n

256
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
to n
 

257
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,350
to n
i have put two numbers so what what's

258
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
i have put two numbers so what what's
 

259
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,110
i have put two numbers so what what's
the what should i do to the n

260
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
the what should i do to the n
 

261
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,670
the what should i do to the n
n is the number of integers we need to

262
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
n is the number of integers we need to
 

263
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,270
n is the number of integers we need to
put in the array

264
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
put in the array
 

265
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,670
put in the array
and then i put one one number i put two

266
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
and then i put one one number i put two
 

267
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,510
and then i put one one number i put two
numbers so what should i do with the n

268
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
numbers so what should i do with the n
 

269
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,629
numbers so what should i do with the n
two what two and

270
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
two what two and
 

271
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,029
two what two and
minus three minus equals two okay and

272
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
minus three minus equals two okay and
 

273
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,070
minus three minus equals two okay and
then

274
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
then
 

275
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,629
then
after this loop okay when n is bigger

276
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
after this loop okay when n is bigger
 

277
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,430
after this loop okay when n is bigger
than two

278
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
than two
 

279
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,150
than two
so after this loop what happened to n n

280
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
so after this loop what happened to n n
 

281
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,189
so after this loop what happened to n n
will be

282
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
will be
 

283
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,390
will be
smaller than two right yeah so what kind

284
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
smaller than two right yeah so what kind
 

285
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,270
smaller than two right yeah so what kind
of value

286
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
of value
 

287
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,120
of value
possible value for the n

288
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,130

 

289
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,309

[Music]

290
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
[Music]
 

291
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,950
[Music]
possible value yeah

292
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960

 

293
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,990

zero and one

294
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
zero and one
 

295
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,990
zero and one
yeah zero and one so one is one what

296
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
yeah zero and one so one is one what
 

297
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,270
yeah zero and one so one is one what
does it mean if n

298
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
does it mean if n
 

299
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,110
does it mean if n
equals one it definitely gets zero

300
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
equals one it definitely gets zero
 

301
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,670
equals one it definitely gets zero
sorry if n is one what what's what does

302
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
sorry if n is one what what's what does
 

303
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,590
sorry if n is one what what's what does
it mean it's original is odd or human

304
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
it mean it's original is odd or human
 

305
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,790
it mean it's original is odd or human
number

306
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
number
 

307
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,909
number
odd odd yeah because it always changes

308
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
odd odd yeah because it always changes
 

309
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,870
odd odd yeah because it always changes
by two

310
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
by two
 

311
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,230
by two
it's all it doesn't change it's uh

312
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
it's all it doesn't change it's uh
 

313
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,230
it's all it doesn't change it's uh
the fact that it's even or all right

314
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
the fact that it's even or all right
 

315
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,510
the fact that it's even or all right
because three is

316
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
because three is
 

317
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,790
because three is
odd and in minus two is one still odd

318
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
odd and in minus two is one still odd
 

319
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,029
odd and in minus two is one still odd
four is even your minus two is two is

320
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
four is even your minus two is two is
 

321
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,390
four is even your minus two is two is
still even right

322
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
still even right
 

323
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,230
still even right
doesn't make sense so when a is one it

324
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
doesn't make sense so when a is one it
 

325
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,510
doesn't make sense so when a is one it
means original number

326
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
means original number
 

327
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,270
means original number
is odd number so in this case

328
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
is odd number so in this case
 

329
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,350
is odd number so in this case
what should we do with that we are

330
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
what should we do with that we are
 

331
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:07,830
what should we do with that we are
missing one

332
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840

 

333
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,370

and then there's one thing missing

334
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:11,380
and then there's one thing missing
 

335
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,830
and then there's one thing missing
[Music]

336
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840

 

337
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,950

returned

338
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
returned
 

339
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,629
returned
okay so we're implementing the second

340
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
okay so we're implementing the second
 

341
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,230
okay so we're implementing the second
approach

342
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
approach
 

343
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,710
approach
okay so does it make sense yeah yeah

344
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
okay so does it make sense yeah yeah
 

345
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,909
okay so does it make sense yeah yeah
okay now

346
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
okay now
 

347
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,790
okay now
using the triangle thingy what triangle

348
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
using the triangle thingy what triangle
 

349
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,350
using the triangle thingy what triangle
thing

350
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
thing
 

351
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,230
thing
nothing okay so i will be start from

352
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
nothing okay so i will be start from
 

353
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,390
nothing okay so i will be start from
zero okay so now

354
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
zero okay so now
 

355
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,390
zero okay so now
answer will be start from

356
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
answer will be start from
 

357
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,469
answer will be start from
at the beginning and then we have a sum

358
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
at the beginning and then we have a sum
 

359
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,749
at the beginning and then we have a sum
equals zero okay

360
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
equals zero okay
 

361
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,510
equals zero okay
i add one until n minus two so look look

362
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
i add one until n minus two so look look
 

363
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,189
i add one until n minus two so look look
wire and bigger lens

364
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
wire and bigger lens
 

365
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,029
wire and bigger lens
yellow are bigger than one okay because

366
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
yellow are bigger than one okay because
 

367
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,670
yellow are bigger than one okay because
we we need to save the last value right

368
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
we we need to save the last value right
 

369
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,830
we we need to save the last value right
the last value yeah yeah so look our

370
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:54,840
the last value yeah yeah so look our
 

371
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:06,470
the last value yeah yeah so look our
answer columns

372
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:06,480

 

373
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,029

[Music]

374
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039

 

375
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,869

column okay okay one okay i plus equals

376
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
column okay okay one okay i plus equals
 

377
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,270
column okay okay one okay i plus equals
one so i will become zero to one right

378
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
one so i will become zero to one right
 

379
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,150
one so i will become zero to one right
yes and then sum i need to add the sum

380
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
yes and then sum i need to add the sum
 

381
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,270
yes and then sum i need to add the sum
to

382
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
to
 

383
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,189
to
n sum equals and actually i need to put

384
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
n sum equals and actually i need to put
 

385
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,230
n sum equals and actually i need to put
it here

386
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
it here
 

387
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,110
it here
apparently i so the current sum is what

388
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
apparently i so the current sum is what
 

389
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,390
apparently i so the current sum is what
and i right

390
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
and i right
 

391
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,110
and i right
yeah and then i plus equals one right

392
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
yeah and then i plus equals one right
 

393
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,149
yeah and then i plus equals one right
and then

394
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
and then
 

395
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,190
and then
and what i i put one number so what

396
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
and what i i put one number so what
 

397
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:51,269
and what i i put one number so what
should i do with it

398
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279

 

399
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,710

so now n will become

400
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
so now n will become
 

401
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,110
so now n will become
zero right yeah becomes zero because

402
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
zero right yeah becomes zero because
 

403
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,470
zero right yeah becomes zero because
it's smaller

404
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
it's smaller
 

405
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,310
it's smaller
even it will become one because n is

406
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
even it will become one because n is
 

407
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,670
even it will become one because n is
bigger than one into this and

408
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
bigger than one into this and
 

409
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,470
bigger than one into this and
now n will be one right okay so there's

410
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
now n will be one right okay so there's
 

411
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,350
now n will be one right okay so there's
a special case

412
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
a special case
 

413
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,790
a special case
if n is zero

414
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800

 

415
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,590

no i can do this answer to a pen

416
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600

 

417
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,430

open what minus what

418
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
open what minus what
 

419
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,710
open what minus what
right when n is 0 s is zero minus

420
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
right when n is 0 s is zero minus
 

421
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,389
right when n is 0 s is zero minus
s is zero that's fine when that is one

422
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399

 

423
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,269

no n is one because n cannot be zero n

424
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
no n is one because n cannot be zero n
 

425
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,230
no n is one because n cannot be zero n
is one

426
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
is one
 

427
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,509
is one
it does not go inside and a minus zero

428
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
it does not go inside and a minus zero
 

429
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:35,990
it does not go inside and a minus zero
like this

430
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
like this
 

431
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,389
like this
one is n is two i add a uh

432
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
one is n is two i add a uh
 

433
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,910
one is n is two i add a uh
when n is to look when n is two

434
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
when n is to look when n is two
 

435
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,470
when n is to look when n is two
i add a zero

436
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480

 

437
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,030

okay so i think i think this should be

438
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
okay so i think i think this should be
 

439
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,790
okay so i think i think this should be
one stop number one okay i

440
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
one stop number one okay i
 

441
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,110
one stop number one okay i
when i put a one and then

442
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
when i put a one and then
 

443
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,470
when i put a one and then
i i just put up s right

444
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
i i just put up s right
 

445
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,509
i i just put up s right
put minus s yes all right oh yeah

446
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
put minus s yes all right oh yeah
 

447
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,310
put minus s yes all right oh yeah
does it make sense look this s is this s

448
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
does it make sense look this s is this s
 

449
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,870
does it make sense look this s is this s
thingy

450
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
thingy
 

451
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,949
thingy
is the first n minus one numbers the sum

452
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
is the first n minus one numbers the sum
 

453
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:11,670
is the first n minus one numbers the sum
of the first

454
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
of the first
 

455
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,790
of the first
and minus numbers yeah all right and the

456
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
and minus numbers yeah all right and the
 

457
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,269
and minus numbers yeah all right and the
minus

458
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
minus
 

459
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,509
minus
n is the last number because i want to

460
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
n is the last number because i want to
 

461
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,350
n is the last number because i want to
negate the

462
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
negate the
 

463
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,190
negate the
the the sum right yes so let's let's

464
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
the the sum right yes so let's let's
 

465
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,990
the the sum right yes so let's let's
write that one let's let's do this one n

466
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
write that one let's let's do this one n
 

467
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,710
write that one let's let's do this one n
equals

468
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
equals
 

469
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,750
equals
two n equals two right

470
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
two n equals two right
 

471
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,069
two n equals two right
append one

472
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079

 

473
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,630

and n will reduce by one level which is

474
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
and n will reduce by one level which is
 

475
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,910
and n will reduce by one level which is
one and go outside

476
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
one and go outside
 

477
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,389
one and go outside
s will be one minus one you'll be one

478
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
s will be one minus one you'll be one
 

479
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,590
s will be one minus one you'll be one
minus one that will work

480
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
minus one that will work
 

481
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,030
minus one that will work
right when n is three

482
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
right when n is three
 

483
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,069
right when n is three
music when only so you print

484
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
music when only so you print
 

485
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,389
music when only so you print
one two right the sum will be three and

486
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
one two right the sum will be three and
 

487
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,910
one two right the sum will be three and
the last one will be put

488
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
the last one will be put
 

489
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,790
the last one will be put
one two minus three right it's still one

490
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
one two minus three right it's still one
 

491
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,110
one two minus three right it's still one
when

492
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
when
 

493
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,630
when
n is one it doesn't go inside look

494
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
n is one it doesn't go inside look
 

495
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,350
n is one it doesn't go inside look
it doesn't go inside right well n is one

496
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
it doesn't go inside right well n is one
 

497
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,750
it doesn't go inside right well n is one
because

498
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
because
 

499
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,790
because
and th this loop you only go into this

500
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
and th this loop you only go into this
 

501
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,350
and th this loop you only go into this
loop when

502

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,110
than one right
now it's is what happens if it's the

508
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
now it's is what happens if it's the
 

509
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,470
now it's is what happens if it's the
same as one

510
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
same as one
 

511
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,710
same as one
yeah yeah n is one it doesn't go inside

512
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
yeah yeah n is one it doesn't go inside
 

513
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,389
yeah yeah n is one it doesn't go inside
so append minus

514
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
so append minus
 

515
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,310
so append minus
s will be minus zero will be zero so

516
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
s will be minus zero will be zero so
 

517
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,670
s will be minus zero will be zero so
it's still up okay

518
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
it's still up okay
 

519
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,509
it's still up okay
does it make sense when n is four

520
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
does it make sense when n is four
 

521
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,430
does it make sense when n is four
so look for i one two three

522
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
so look for i one two three
 

523
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,790
so look for i one two three
one two three yeah one two three six

524
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
one two three yeah one two three six
 

525
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,430
one two three yeah one two three six
yeah because the sum will be be six and

526
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
yeah because the sum will be be six and
 

527
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,470
yeah because the sum will be be six and
then minus s

528
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
then minus s
 

529
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,230
then minus s
will be minus six right does it make

530
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
will be minus six right does it make
 

531
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,990
will be minus six right does it make
sense okay

532
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
sense okay
 

533
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,430
sense okay
what's the time complexity a

534
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
what's the time complexity a
 

535
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,949
what's the time complexity a
and what n yeah and because

536
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
and what n yeah and because
 

537
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,590
and what n yeah and because
we are generating numbers yeah yeah

538
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
we are generating numbers yeah yeah
 

539
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,269
we are generating numbers yeah yeah
what's the space complexity

540
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
what's the space complexity
 

541
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,990
what's the space complexity
i win yeah well done wow that's very

542
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
i win yeah well done wow that's very
 

543
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,190
i win yeah well done wow that's very
quick we're done because

544
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
quick we're done because
 

545
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,030
quick we're done because
we are using uh what

546
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
we are using uh what
 

547
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,790
we are using uh what
thumb no why are you using a list

548
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
thumb no why are you using a list
 

549
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,069
thumb no why are you using a list
at least yeah quickly yeah that's good

550
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
at least yeah quickly yeah that's good
 

551
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,590
at least yeah quickly yeah that's good
that's good boy okay

552
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
that's good boy okay
 

553
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,790
that's good boy okay
so the last thing to say to the people

554
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
so the last thing to say to the people
 

555
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,949
so the last thing to say to the people
and then

556
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959

 

557
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,240

bye-bye see you tomorrow
