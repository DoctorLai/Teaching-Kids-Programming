00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,030

hello hello

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,040
hello hello
 

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,430
hello hello
hello miss mommy how are you today good

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,440
hello miss mommy how are you today good
 

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,749
hello miss mommy how are you today good
okay so we talked about the metric a few

6
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
okay so we talked about the metric a few
 

7
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,390
okay so we talked about the metric a few
days ago today we're going to talk about

8
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
days ago today we're going to talk about
 

9
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,350
days ago today we're going to talk about
implementing the metric multiplication

10
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
implementing the metric multiplication
 

11
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,390
implementing the metric multiplication
of the

12
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
of the
 

13
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,590
of the
power function so a to the power of n is

14
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,600
power function so a to the power of n is
 

15
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,830
power function so a to the power of n is
a times a times a how many a times

16
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
a times a times a how many a times
 

17
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,950
a times a times a how many a times
together

18
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
together
 

19
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,870
together
um and yes what's the time complexity oh

20
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:24,880
um and yes what's the time complexity oh
 

21
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,349
um and yes what's the time complexity oh
because these they are n so o

22
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
because these they are n so o
 

23
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,470
because these they are n so o
we're done

24
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,480
we're done
 

25
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,910
we're done
okay so um

26
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920

 

27
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,389

in order for two metrics to multiply

28
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:34,399
in order for two metrics to multiply
 

29
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,310
in order for two metrics to multiply
together if they're matching a and b we

30
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
together if they're matching a and b we
 

31
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,670
together if they're matching a and b we
if we want to multiply a to the metric b

32
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
if we want to multiply a to the metric b
 

33
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,790
if we want to multiply a to the metric b
right we want to multiply together so

34
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
right we want to multiply together so
 

35
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,430
right we want to multiply together so
the magic the dimension if this matrix a

36
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
the magic the dimension if this matrix a
 

37
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,229
the magic the dimension if this matrix a
is dimensional a times b you know a rows

38
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
is dimensional a times b you know a rows
 

39
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,350
is dimensional a times b you know a rows
b columns and b metric is c times d

40
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
b columns and b metric is c times d
 

41
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,430
b columns and b metric is c times d
in order for them to be multiplied

42
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
in order for them to be multiplied
 

43
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,510
in order for them to be multiplied
together we need

44
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
together we need
 

45
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,830
together we need
to make

46
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840
to make
 

47
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,590
to make
sure b and c should be

48
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
sure b and c should be
 

49
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,910
sure b and c should be
the same should be the same yes so for

50
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
the same should be the same yes so for
 

51
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,270
the same should be the same yes so for
example like if these 1 1 0 0 this is 2

52
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
example like if these 1 1 0 0 this is 2
 

53
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,990
example like if these 1 1 0 0 this is 2
times 2 matching we can times any metric

54
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
times 2 matching we can times any metric
 

55
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,789
times 2 matching we can times any metric
which is two rows and

56
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
which is two rows and
 

57
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,469
which is two rows and
any columns yeah so it could be two

58
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
any columns yeah so it could be two
 

59
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,030
any columns yeah so it could be two
times n columns right so let's say if we

60
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
times n columns right so let's say if we
 

61
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,630
times n columns right so let's say if we
have times two rows and three columns

62
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
have times two rows and three columns
 

63
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,550
have times two rows and three columns
two rows three columns one

64
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
two rows three columns one
 

65
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,350
two rows three columns one
two three four five six we can times it

66
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
two three four five six we can times it
 

67
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,070
two three four five six we can times it
together so how do we do this we we can

68
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
together so how do we do this we we can
 

69
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,390
together so how do we do this we we can
do this um

70
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
do this um
 

71
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,230
do this um
yeah so this row we we multiply

72
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
yeah so this row we we multiply
 

73
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,030
yeah so this row we we multiply
we take the rows of the first metric and

74
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
we take the rows of the first metric and
 

75
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,749
we take the rows of the first metric and
multiply and to the operator of the

76
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
multiply and to the operator of the
 

77
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,390
multiply and to the operator of the
second uh of recurrence of the second

78
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
second uh of recurrence of the second
 

79
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,030
second uh of recurrence of the second
magic so but one zero one four we do the

80
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
magic so but one zero one four we do the
 

81
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,670
magic so but one zero one four we do the
dot product so the dot product let's

82
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:45,680
dot product so the dot product let's
 

83
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,109
dot product so the dot product let's
stop that

84
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
stop that
 

85
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,109
stop that
if two two vectors there are two vector

86
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
if two two vectors there are two vector
 

87
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,870
if two two vectors there are two vector
two arrays in

88
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
two arrays in
 

89
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,910
two arrays in
uh

90
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
uh
 

91
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,590
uh
vectors you have two vectors we

92
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
vectors you have two vectors we
 

93
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,749
vectors you have two vectors we
represent using array if there are some

94
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
represent using array if there are some
 

95
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,830
represent using array if there are some
lengths we can multiply together using

96
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
lengths we can multiply together using
 

97
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,310
lengths we can multiply together using
the dot product so for example like a

98
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
the dot product so for example like a
 

99
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,670
the dot product so for example like a
times b

100
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
times b
 

101
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,389
times b
equals the sum yeah this is true matrix

102
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
equals the sum yeah this is true matrix
 

103
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,350
equals the sum yeah this is true matrix
a and b trigonometric the arrays the

104
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
a and b trigonometric the arrays the
 

105
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,830
a and b trigonometric the arrays the
list vectors

106
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
list vectors
 

107
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,949
list vectors
vectors we do the dot product so it's a

108
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
vectors we do the dot product so it's a
 

109
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,150
vectors we do the dot product so it's a
sum of

110
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
sum of
 

111
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,710
sum of
sum of i equals 0 to n minus 1 if there

112
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
sum of i equals 0 to n minus 1 if there
 

113
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,550
sum of i equals 0 to n minus 1 if there
are n elements yeah and then we do this

114
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
are n elements yeah and then we do this
 

115
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,910
are n elements yeah and then we do this
a i

116
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
a i
 

117
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,949
a i
the first the element at index i

118
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
the first the element at index i
 

119
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,670
the first the element at index i
times bi and then we sum it together so

120
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
times bi and then we sum it together so
 

121
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,150
times bi and then we sum it together so
for example if this one zero one four

122
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
for example if this one zero one four
 

123
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,990
for example if this one zero one four
one zero one four

124
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
one zero one four
 

125
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,630
one zero one four
so the double side will be one times one

126
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
so the double side will be one times one
 

127
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,670
so the double side will be one times one
plus zero times four which is

128
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
plus zero times four which is
 

129
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,910
plus zero times four which is
one right so one

130
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
one right so one
 

131
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,070
one right so one
one zero one four and we put it here

132
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
one zero one four and we put it here
 

133
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,350
one zero one four and we put it here
which is

134
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
which is
 

135
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,309
which is
one

136
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
one
 

137
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,110
one
right

138
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
right
 

139
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,910
right
so this this the metric

140
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
so this this the metric
 

141
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,030
so this this the metric
is the metric is a information is the

142
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
is the metric is a information is the
 

143
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,670
is the metric is a information is the
square matrix and with all the elements

144
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
square matrix and with all the elements
 

145
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,150
square matrix and with all the elements
a diagonal diagonal is equal to one and

146
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
a diagonal diagonal is equal to one and
 

147
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,509
a diagonal diagonal is equal to one and
a zero

148
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
a zero
 

149
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,509
a zero
in the rest of place we call it identity

150
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
in the rest of place we call it identity
 

151
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,670
in the rest of place we call it identity
magic we use the i so what's the

152
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
magic we use the i so what's the
 

153
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,630
magic we use the i so what's the
identity it looks you it's quite similar

154
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
identity it looks you it's quite similar
 

155
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,190
identity it looks you it's quite similar
as the number one right so i need any

156
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
as the number one right so i need any
 

157
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,589
as the number one right so i need any
metric times identity matrix

158
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
metric times identity matrix
 

159
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,589
metric times identity matrix
it's the same it won't change right so

160
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
it's the same it won't change right so
 

161
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,070
it's the same it won't change right so
these times that if you do it perform it

162
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
these times that if you do it perform it
 

163
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,990
these times that if you do it perform it
it will be like one two three four five

164
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
it will be like one two three four five
 

165
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,790
it will be like one two three four five
six

166
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
six
 

167
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,470
six
and then you reverse it is still the

168
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
and then you reverse it is still the
 

169
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,470
and then you reverse it is still the
same right if it's

170
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,480
same right if it's
 

171
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,149
same right if it's
can you reverse it

172
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
can you reverse it
 

173
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,110
can you reverse it
one two three four five six if you times

174
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
one two three four five six if you times
 

175
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,229
one two three four five six if you times
the this is what two times three

176
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
the this is what two times three
 

177
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,869
the this is what two times three
right two times two rows three columns

178
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
right two times two rows three columns
 

179
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,670
right two times two rows three columns
and you can't multiply you can multiply

180
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
and you can't multiply you can multiply
 

181
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,390
and you can't multiply you can multiply
two rows to color right you can't do it

182
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
two rows to color right you can't do it
 

183
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,270
two rows to color right you can't do it
so how do we fix this if it's two rows

184
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
so how do we fix this if it's two rows
 

185
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,390
so how do we fix this if it's two rows
three columns the matrix look this is i

186
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
three columns the matrix look this is i
 

187
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,750
three columns the matrix look this is i
this is a

188
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
this is a
 

189
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,869
this is a
i can say makes sense but a times i we

190
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
i can say makes sense but a times i we
 

191
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,470
i can say makes sense but a times i we
can multiply it

192
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
can multiply it
 

193
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,390
can multiply it
this i needs to be changed because it's

194
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
this i needs to be changed because it's
 

195
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,470
this i needs to be changed because it's
no longer two times two identity matrix

196
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
no longer two times two identity matrix
 

197
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,949
no longer two times two identity matrix
is three times three times magical if we

198
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
is three times three times magical if we
 

199
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,750
is three times three times magical if we
can just change this to three zero three

200
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
can just change this to three zero three
 

201
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,550
can just change this to three zero three
columns so you'll be multiply uh you

202
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
columns so you'll be multiply uh you
 

203
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,070
columns so you'll be multiply uh you
will be much multiplying it will be much

204
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
will be much multiplying it will be much
 

205
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,229
will be much multiplying it will be much
better one one one three times three

206
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
better one one one three times three
 

207
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,309
better one one one three times three
identity metric instead instead of two

208
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
identity metric instead instead of two
 

209
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,070
identity metric instead instead of two
times two okay

210
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
times two okay
 

211
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,990
times two okay
so

212
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
so
 

213
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,149
so
so we talk about how to multiply these n

214
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
so we talk about how to multiply these n
 

215
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,429
so we talk about how to multiply these n
terms but is there a quicker way

216
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
terms but is there a quicker way
 

217
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,190
terms but is there a quicker way
let's talk about the numbers first if we

218
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
let's talk about the numbers first if we
 

219
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,830
let's talk about the numbers first if we
want to calculate 2 to the power of 100

220
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
want to calculate 2 to the power of 100
 

221
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,469
want to calculate 2 to the power of 100
one way is to multiply these two how

222
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
one way is to multiply these two how
 

223
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,950
one way is to multiply these two how
many times

224
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
many times
 

225
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,550
many times
how many times

226
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
how many times
 

227
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,110
how many times
100 times yes we're done 2 times 2 times

228
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
100 times yes we're done 2 times 2 times
 

229
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,830
100 times yes we're done 2 times 2 times
to

230
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
to
 

231
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,070
to
a hundred times yeah but that's going to

232
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
a hundred times yeah but that's going to
 

233
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,950
a hundred times yeah but that's going to
take a linear nino yeah linear

234
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
take a linear nino yeah linear
 

235
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,870
take a linear nino yeah linear
linear complexities because this a

236
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
linear complexities because this a
 

237
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,230
linear complexities because this a
hundred you need to do this a hundred

238
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
hundred you need to do this a hundred
 

239
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,390
hundred you need to do this a hundred
times so a to the power of b

240
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
times so a to the power of b
 

241
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,030
times so a to the power of b
to the power of n if you times the a

242
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
to the power of n if you times the a
 

243
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,510
to the power of n if you times the a
n times that's going to take all n time

244
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
n times that's going to take all n time
 

245
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,830
n times that's going to take all n time
complexity this is linear so what's

246
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
complexity this is linear so what's
 

247
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,350
complexity this is linear so what's
linear so you can draw a graph this is a

248
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
linear so you can draw a graph this is a
 

249
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,030
linear so you can draw a graph this is a
yeah and then

250
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
yeah and then
 

251
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,270
yeah and then
the vertical vertical axis is the time

252
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
the vertical vertical axis is the time
 

253
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,629
the vertical vertical axis is the time
the complexity

254
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
the complexity
 

255
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,230
the complexity
and if you draw the linear you'll be

256
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
and if you draw the linear you'll be
 

257
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,469
and if you draw the linear you'll be
like that

258
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
like that
 

259
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,270
like that
okay

260
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280

 

261
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,909

okay so now we want to speed this up so

262
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
okay so now we want to speed this up so
 

263
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,909
okay so now we want to speed this up so
2 to the power 100 can we divide it

264
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
2 to the power 100 can we divide it
 

265
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,550
2 to the power 100 can we divide it
can we solve the first question which is

266
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
can we solve the first question which is
 

267
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,430
can we solve the first question which is
can we get computer 2 to the power of 50

268
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
can we get computer 2 to the power of 50
 

269
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,629
can we get computer 2 to the power of 50
first

270
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
first
 

271
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,510
first
yes okay so if we have 2 to the power 50

272
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
yes okay so if we have 2 to the power 50
 

273
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,189
yes okay so if we have 2 to the power 50
what what do we do to get the 2 to the

274
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
what what do we do to get the 2 to the
 

275
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,710
what what do we do to get the 2 to the
power of 100

276
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720

 

277
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,430

square square yeah we're not so 2 to the

278
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
square square yeah we're not so 2 to the
 

279
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,510
square square yeah we're not so 2 to the
power 50 then we can say 2 to the power

280
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
power 50 then we can say 2 to the power
 

281
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,550
power 50 then we can say 2 to the power
50 times square right so what does it

282
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
50 times square right so what does it
 

283
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,350
50 times square right so what does it
mean

284
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
mean
 

285
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,550
mean
we

286
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
we
 

287
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,710
we
we if we do this proof force you have to

288
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
we if we do this proof force you have to
 

289
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,189
we if we do this proof force you have to
this 100 times now

290
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
this 100 times now
 

291
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,230
this 100 times now
if we do this 50 times 2 to the power 50

292
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
if we do this 50 times 2 to the power 50
 

293
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,310
if we do this 50 times 2 to the power 50
50 times we just need to do it one more

294
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
50 times we just need to do it one more
 

295
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,110
50 times we just need to do it one more
time so 51 so you see we save almost

296
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
time so 51 so you see we save almost
 

297
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,830
time so 51 so you see we save almost
half of it right now look look if we 250

298
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:47,840
half of it right now look look if we 250
 

299
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,950
half of it right now look look if we 250
we can keep continue to 250 equals 2 to

300
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
we can keep continue to 250 equals 2 to
 

301
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,990
we can keep continue to 250 equals 2 to
the power of 35 square right and how

302
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
the power of 35 square right and how
 

303
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,710
the power of 35 square right and how
about 225 if we it's not an even number

304
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
about 225 if we it's not an even number
 

305
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,790
about 225 if we it's not an even number
the n is not an even number how do we do

306
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
the n is not an even number how do we do
 

307
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,749
the n is not an even number how do we do
this

308
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
this
 

309
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,749
this
if 2 to the 25

310
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
if 2 to the 25
 

311
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,950
if 2 to the 25
what should we do

312
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
what should we do
 

313
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,230
what should we do
uh 2 to the 24

314
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
uh 2 to the 24
 

315
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,510
uh 2 to the 24
2 to the power of 24 times 2 yes so so

316
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
2 to the power of 24 times 2 yes so so
 

317
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,950
2 to the power of 24 times 2 yes so so
to sum up

318
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
to sum up
 

319
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,469
to sum up
the sum of f

320
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:12,479
the sum of f
 

321
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,230
the sum of f
a to the power of n

322
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,240
a to the power of n
 

323
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,710
a to the power of n
equals we can use the curly uh big curve

324
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
equals we can use the curly uh big curve
 

325
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,590
equals we can use the curly uh big curve
base equals 2 to a to the power of n

326
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
base equals 2 to a to the power of n
 

327
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,710
base equals 2 to a to the power of n
minus

328
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
minus
 

329
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,309
minus
n divided by 2

00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
n divided by 2
 

331
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,670
n divided by 2
and squared is n is

332
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
and squared is n is
 

333
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,350
and squared is n is
even right even number and or equals a

n is hot
 

339
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,950
n is hot
okay

340
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960

 

341
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,230

uh

342
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
uh
 

343
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,070
uh
so what's the time complexity if you can

344
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
so what's the time complexity if you can
 

345
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,150
so what's the time complexity if you can
remember uh see this well every time we

346
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
remember uh see this well every time we
 

347
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,550
remember uh see this well every time we
we divide this n into half because we we

348
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
we divide this n into half because we we
 

349
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,950
we divide this n into half because we we
understand this right if we want to

350
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
understand this right if we want to
 

351
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,629
understand this right if we want to
solve this big problem we can solve the

352
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
solve this big problem we can solve the
 

353
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,870
solve this big problem we can solve the
half of a problem and on everything we

354
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:52,880
half of a problem and on everything we
 

355
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,950
half of a problem and on everything we
can keep solving this half our problem

356
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
can keep solving this half our problem
 

357
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,150
can keep solving this half our problem
half of her

358
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
half of her
 

359
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,870
half of her
we keep dividing into half so in this

360
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
we keep dividing into half so in this
 

361
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,510
we keep dividing into half so in this
case we the time complexity is what we

362
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
case we the time complexity is what we
 

363
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,309
case we the time complexity is what we
keep dividing into half right we keep

364
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
keep dividing into half right we keep
 

365
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,710
keep dividing into half right we keep
dividing into half

366
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
dividing into half
 

367
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,710
dividing into half
n times right

368
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
n times right
 

369
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,510
n times right
so

370
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
so
 

371
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,430
so
what's the time complexity of this one

372
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
what's the time complexity of this one
 

373
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,309
what's the time complexity of this one
so it's all

374
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
so it's all
 

375
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,270
so it's all
log base 2 m right what's log function

376
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280

 

377
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,550

log

378
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
log
 

379
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,230
log
a to the power b

380
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
a to the power b
 

381
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,510
a to the power b
a b equals n can we write it as

382
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
a b equals n can we write it as
 

383
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,710
a b equals n can we write it as
a to the power n equals b okay

384
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
a to the power n equals b okay
 

385
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,189
a to the power n equals b okay
so if we draw these axes

386
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
so if we draw these axes
 

387
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,510
so if we draw these axes
so previously yeah previously we have

388
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
so previously yeah previously we have
 

389
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,350
so previously yeah previously we have
this oh

390
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
this oh
 

391
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,230
this oh
linear linear is on

392
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
linear linear is on
 

393
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,390
linear linear is on
now log n how can you draw the logan

394
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
now log n how can you draw the logan
 

395
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,550
now log n how can you draw the logan
function it's like that log

396
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
function it's like that log
 

397
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,830
function it's like that log
log 2 to the power of 1 so look 2 to the

398
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
log 2 to the power of 1 so look 2 to the
 

399
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,029
log 2 to the power of 1 so look 2 to the
power of

400
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
power of
 

401
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,710
power of
1 uh 2 to what equals power 1 0 right so

402
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
1 uh 2 to what equals power 1 0 right so
 

403
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,110
1 uh 2 to what equals power 1 0 right so
1 y

404
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
1 y
 

405
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,629
1 y
uh when

406
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
uh when
 

407
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,550
uh when
y this is y right

408
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
y this is y right
 

409
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,749
y this is y right
x so when y is 0 x is what

410
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
x so when y is 0 x is what
 

411
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,550
x so when y is 0 x is what
log y equals y equals log 2 x so when y

412
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
log y equals y equals log 2 x so when y
 

413
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,150
log y equals y equals log 2 x so when y
is 0 what's the value of x

414
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
is 0 what's the value of x
 

415
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,110
is 0 what's the value of x
this is this is why this is a one

416
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
this is this is why this is a one
 

417
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,830
this is this is why this is a one
y is zero what's the value of x

418
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
y is zero what's the value of x
 

419
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,589
y is zero what's the value of x
look look at this look at this okay

420
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
look look at this look at this okay
 

421
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,510
look look at this look at this okay
i know it's a

422
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
i know it's a
 

423
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,909
i know it's a
what's

424
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919

 

425
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,550

a what's a a is 2

426
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
a what's a a is 2
 

427
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,830
a what's a a is 2
a

428
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
a
 

429
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,990
a
2 to the power of

430
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
2 to the power of
 

431
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,909
2 to the power of
0 equals what's the value of b

432
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
0 equals what's the value of b
 

433
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,029
0 equals what's the value of b
2 to the power of 0 what's this 1 1 okay

434
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
2 to the power of 0 what's this 1 1 okay
 

435
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,790
2 to the power of 0 what's this 1 1 okay
so when x is 1 y is zero so it's here

436
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
so when x is 1 y is zero so it's here
 

437
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,310
so when x is 1 y is zero so it's here
it's going through here right look at

438
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
it's going through here right look at
 

439
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,630
it's going through here right look at
that pay attention

440
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
that pay attention
 

441
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,590
that pay attention
okay yeah and then we if we drawing it

442
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
okay yeah and then we if we drawing it
 

443
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,590
okay yeah and then we if we drawing it
you'll be like there so which one is

444
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
you'll be like there so which one is
 

445
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,829
you'll be like there so which one is
better so two complete two egg run for

446
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
better so two complete two egg run for
 

447
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,750
better so two complete two egg run for
example which one is better second one

448
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
example which one is better second one
 

449
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,470
example which one is better second one
second one why is it better

450
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
second one why is it better
 

451
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,829
second one why is it better
why is better because look if x x is the

452
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
why is better because look if x x is the
 

453
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,070
why is better because look if x x is the
size of the problem right if we keep

454
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
size of the problem right if we keep
 

455
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,990
size of the problem right if we keep
increasing the x it does not the

456
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
increasing the x it does not the
 

457
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,150
increasing the x it does not the
complexity does not grow linear right

458
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
complexity does not grow linear right
 

459
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,670
complexity does not grow linear right
instead it would be

460
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
instead it would be
 

461
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,430
instead it would be
like left right you'd be like that

462
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
like left right you'd be like that
 

463
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,070
like left right you'd be like that
lesson it's reduced right

464
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
lesson it's reduced right
 

465
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,910
lesson it's reduced right
so the same we can do this with the uh

466
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
so the same we can do this with the uh
 

467
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,829
so the same we can do this with the uh
battery multiplication okay so if n

468
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
battery multiplication okay so if n
 

469
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,509
battery multiplication okay so if n
if n is the even number

470
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
if n is the even number
 

471
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,710
if n is the even number
we

472
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
we
 

473
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,509
we
divide it yeah and a square yeah

474
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
divide it yeah and a square yeah
 

475
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,430
divide it yeah and a square yeah
if n is odd number we reduce by one so

476
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
if n is odd number we reduce by one so
 

477
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,269
if n is odd number we reduce by one so
at the beginning what should we give to

478
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
at the beginning what should we give to
 

479
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,350
at the beginning what should we give to
the answer to do it

480
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
the answer to do it
 

481
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,190
the answer to do it
it's identity yeah we give you this

482
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
it's identity yeah we give you this
 

483
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,030
it's identity yeah we give you this
identifier first

484
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
identifier first
 

485
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,870
identifier first
and then we can keep this is the result

486
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
and then we can keep this is the result
 

487
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,949
and then we can keep this is the result
for example and then you know identity

488
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
for example and then you know identity
 

489
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,750
for example and then you know identity
for

490
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
for
 

491
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,870
for
for that energy times the a and times a

492
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
for that energy times the a and times a
 

493
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,509
for that energy times the a and times a
times a you know any you know by

494
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
times a you know any you know by
 

495
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,590
times a you know any you know by
following this pattern we can reduce it

496
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
following this pattern we can reduce it
 

497
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,670
following this pattern we can reduce it
we can calculate the answer if n is the

498
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
we can calculate the answer if n is the
 

499
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,110
we can calculate the answer if n is the
even number yeah we square it

500
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
even number yeah we square it
 

501
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,389
even number yeah we square it
if n is odd number we times it yeah okay

502
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
if n is odd number we times it yeah okay
 

503
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,870
if n is odd number we times it yeah okay
so let's write this okay

504
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
so let's write this okay
 

505
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,990
so let's write this okay
define

506
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
define
 

507
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,750
define
ma uh we say power power function for

508
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
ma uh we say power power function for
 

509
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,110
ma uh we say power power function for
matrix a

510
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
matrix a
 

511
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,790
matrix a
n right

512
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
n right
 

513
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,870
n right
okay so first of all we need to make

514
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
okay so first of all we need to make
 

515
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,990
okay so first of all we need to make
sure make sure the number of rows of a

516
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
sure make sure the number of rows of a
 

517
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,310
sure make sure the number of rows of a
and columns is the same here

518
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
and columns is the same here
 

519
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,990
and columns is the same here
why is that because look if it's a

520
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
why is that because look if it's a
 

521
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,310
why is that because look if it's a
matrix can times itself if a can times

522
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
matrix can times itself if a can times
 

523
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,350
matrix can times itself if a can times
itself

524
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
itself
 

525
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,509
itself
if a is the matrix

526
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
if a is the matrix
 

527
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,389
if a is the matrix
dimension of a rows b columns if you if

528
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
dimension of a rows b columns if you if
 

529
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,670
dimension of a rows b columns if you if
we need to be able to multiply itself

530
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
we need to be able to multiply itself
 

531
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,750
we need to be able to multiply itself
it's a times b what does it mean

532
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
it's a times b what does it mean
 

533
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,509
it's a times b what does it mean
what does mean a

534
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
what does mean a
 

535
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,550
what does mean a
a equals b okay a equals b so a equals b

536
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
a equals b okay a equals b so a equals b
 

537
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,150
a equals b okay a equals b so a equals b
so let's do this

538
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
so let's do this
 

539
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,870
so let's do this
so look the row the number of rows the

540
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
so look the row the number of rows the
 

541
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,710
so look the row the number of rows the
rows

542
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
rows
 

543
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,069
rows
equals length a this is getting uh

544
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
equals length a this is getting uh
 

545
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,509
equals length a this is getting uh
uh

546
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
uh
 

547
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,470
uh
the rows of the magic and then columns

548
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
the rows of the magic and then columns
 

549
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,069
the rows of the magic and then columns
equals length

550
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
equals length
 

551
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,230
equals length
a0 yeah because we're getting the first

552
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
a0 yeah because we're getting the first
 

553
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,310
a0 yeah because we're getting the first
row and then we return the dimension of

554
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
row and then we return the dimension of
 

555
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,550
row and then we return the dimension of
the rows so we need to assert what's

556
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
the rows so we need to assert what's
 

557
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,710
the rows so we need to assert what's
assuming in english

558
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
assuming in english
 

559
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,630
assuming in english
as a rows

560
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
as a rows
 

561
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,870
as a rows
equal current right

562
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
equal current right
 

563
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,110
equal current right
yeah and if we want to make sure we can

564
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
yeah and if we want to make sure we can
 

565
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,590
yeah and if we want to make sure we can
assert these as a

566
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
assert these as a
 

567
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,750
assert these as a
rows bigger than zero so if it's the

568
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
rows bigger than zero so if it's the
 

569
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,550
rows bigger than zero so if it's the
empty matrix we don't continue right

570
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
empty matrix we don't continue right
 

571
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,949
empty matrix we don't continue right
so other means that to make sure to

572
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
so other means that to make sure to
 

573
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,190
so other means that to make sure to
double check if the computer

574
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
double check if the computer
 

575
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,110
double check if the computer
find out the rows and columns it did

576
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120

 

577
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,190

the computer will saw an error

578
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
the computer will saw an error
 

579
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,990
the computer will saw an error
and refused to continue

580
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
and refused to continue
 

581
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,829
and refused to continue
okay now we need to create what's the

582
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
okay now we need to create what's the
 

583
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,630
okay now we need to create what's the
result that uh if we multiply the

584
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
result that uh if we multiply the
 

585
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,350
result that uh if we multiply the
number of rows and uh the a what's the

586
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
number of rows and uh the a what's the
 

587
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,670
number of rows and uh the a what's the
dimension or final dimension of a

588
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
dimension or final dimension of a
 

589
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,870
dimension or final dimension of a
is it the same

590
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
is it the same
 

591
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,389
is it the same
it's the same yeah because the rows and

592
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
it's the same yeah because the rows and
 

593
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,829
it's the same yeah because the rows and
columns are say if you multiply it to

594
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
columns are say if you multiply it to
 

595
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,910
columns are say if you multiply it to
the same you'll be the same uh you'll be

596
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
the same you'll be the same uh you'll be
 

597
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,069
the same you'll be the same uh you'll be
the same dimension so we create a metric

598
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
the same dimension so we create a metric
 

599
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,829
the same dimension so we create a metric
which is called red

600
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
which is called red
 

601
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,710
which is called red
red equals 0

602
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
red equals 0
 

603
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,870
red equals 0

so at the beginning

616
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
so at the beginning
 

617
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,990
so at the beginning
at the beginning

618
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,000
at the beginning
 

619
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,150
at the beginning
at the beginning we feel that metric is

620
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,160
at the beginning we feel that metric is
 

621
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,230
at the beginning we feel that metric is
zero but we we need to

622
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
zero but we we need to
 

623
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,389
zero but we we need to
find out we need to

624
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
find out we need to
 

625
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,150
find out we need to
we we need to actually

626
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
we we need to actually
 

627
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,790
we we need to actually
we need to initialize the return metric

628
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
we need to initialize the return metric
 

629
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,629
we need to initialize the return metric
as the identity matrix so what's

630
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
as the identity matrix so what's
 

631
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,949
as the identity matrix so what's
identical matching if this look this is

632
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
identical matching if this look this is
 

633
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,790
identical matching if this look this is
all zero so what do we need to do to

634
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
all zero so what do we need to do to
 

635
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,870
all zero so what do we need to do to
make it identity matrix

636
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880

 

637
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,870

what do we need to do to make this

638
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
what do we need to do to make this
 

639
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,030
what do we need to do to make this
natural identity metric at the beginning

640
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
natural identity metric at the beginning
 

641
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,670
natural identity metric at the beginning
it's all zero what's the identity magic

642
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
it's all zero what's the identity magic
 

643
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,670
it's all zero what's the identity magic
i what i didn't remember remember we

644
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
i what i didn't remember remember we
 

645
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,590
i what i didn't remember remember we
talked about this at the beginning five

646
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
talked about this at the beginning five
 

647
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,269
talked about this at the beginning five
minutes ago yeah you should remember

648
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
minutes ago yeah you should remember
 

649
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,710
minutes ago yeah you should remember
that yeah look

650
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
that yeah look
 

651
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,590
that yeah look
all the diagonals is the one all others

652
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
all the diagonals is the one all others
 

653
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,829
all the diagonals is the one all others
is zero so we just need to change this

654
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
is zero so we just need to change this
 

655
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,590
is zero so we just need to change this
value to one right

656
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
value to one right
 

657
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,430
value to one right
we just need to change this value right

658
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
we just need to change this value right
 

659
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,030
we just need to change this value right
so we use a for loop yeah four are in

660
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
so we use a for loop yeah four are in
 

661
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,470
so we use a for loop yeah four are in
rows

662
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
rows
 

663
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,550
rows
in range row there we want to iterate

664
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
in range row there we want to iterate
 

665
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,870
in range row there we want to iterate
from zero to range rows

666
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:06,880
from zero to range rows
 

667
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,350
from zero to range rows
and then what should we do red

668
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
and then what should we do red
 

669
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,470
and then what should we do red
red

670
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
red
 

671
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,310
red
r

672
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
r
 

673
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,310
r
r is the rows and which is the columns

674
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
r is the rows and which is the columns
 

675
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,110
r is the rows and which is the columns
what's the columns

676
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
what's the columns
 

677
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,790
what's the columns
what's the columns

678
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
what's the columns
 

679
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,870
what's the columns
ah the same yeah the

680
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
ah the same yeah the
 

681
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,629
ah the same yeah the
the first row first column the second

682
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,639
the first row first column the second
 

683
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,069
the first row first column the second
second number equals what one one

684
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
second number equals what one one
 

685
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,550
second number equals what one one
be confident yeah you know like that

686
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
be confident yeah you know like that
 

687
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,190
be confident yeah you know like that
okay so now we have this metric and then

688
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
okay so now we have this metric and then
 

689
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,030
okay so now we have this metric and then
what should we do now what should we do

690
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
what should we do now what should we do
 

691
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,949
what should we do now what should we do
now what should we do now so we we need

692
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
now what should we do now so we we need
 

693
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,990
now what should we do now so we we need
to

694
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
to
 

695
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,190
to
we need to

696
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
we need to
 

697
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,910
we need to
do this y we need to check why n is

698
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
do this y we need to check why n is
 

699
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,150
do this y we need to check why n is
bigger than zero right if it's bigger

700
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
bigger than zero right if it's bigger
 

701
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,990
bigger than zero right if it's bigger
than zero what should we do

702
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
than zero what should we do
 

703
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,230
than zero what should we do
if n

704
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240
if n
 

705
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,509
if n
and

706
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
and
 

707
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,670
and
one

708
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
one
 

709
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,829
one
bigger than zero right if n and one what

710
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
bigger than zero right if n and one what
 

711
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,069
bigger than zero right if n and one what
does it mean if it's an even if it's if

712
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
does it mean if it's an even if it's if
 

713
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:54,949
does it mean if it's an even if it's if
it's

714
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
it's
 

715
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,430
it's
if it's odd number right if it's not all

716
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
if it's odd number right if it's not all
 

717
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,710
if it's odd number right if it's not all
number

718
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
number
 

719
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,470
number
so what we do we should we should add

720
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
so what we do we should we should add
 

721
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,509
so what we do we should we should add
red equals multiply yeah we talked about

722
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
red equals multiply yeah we talked about
 

723
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,430
red equals multiply yeah we talked about
multiply yesterday

724
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
multiply yesterday
 

725
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,750
multiply yesterday
red what

726
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
red what
 

727
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,470
red what
a

728
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480

 

729
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,509

and now we multiply we need to make the

730
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
and now we multiply we need to make the
 

731
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,870
and now we multiply we need to make the
n smaller by half right so how do we do

732
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
n smaller by half right so how do we do
 

733
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,550
n smaller by half right so how do we do
it 55 or and all we can do is a divided

734
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:20,560
it 55 or and all we can do is a divided
 

735
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,509
it 55 or and all we can do is a divided
by equals two or we can shift one

736
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
by equals two or we can shift one
 

737
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,350
by equals two or we can shift one
one position to the right yeah

738
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
one position to the right yeah
 

739
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,870
one position to the right yeah
equals one right

740
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
equals one right
 

741
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,430
equals one right
and then now when we safety we need to

742
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,440
and then now when we safety we need to
 

743
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,949
and then now when we safety we need to
double

744
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
double
 

745
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,389
double
well what do we need we need to square

746
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
well what do we need we need to square
 

747
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,310
well what do we need we need to square
the edges by itself so a equals what

748
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
the edges by itself so a equals what
 

749
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,389
the edges by itself so a equals what
i equals one

750
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
i equals one
 

751
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,430
i equals one
multiply multiply what okay

752
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
multiply multiply what okay
 

753
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:52,069
multiply multiply what okay
multiply a yeah

754
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:52,079

 

755
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,949

what's the time complexity

756
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
what's the time complexity
 

757
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,590
what's the time complexity
we talked about this three minutes ago

758
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
we talked about this three minutes ago
 

759
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,350
we talked about this three minutes ago
look

760
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
look
 

761
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,230
look
if we talk about logan and it comes in

762
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
if we talk about logan and it comes in
 

763
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,870
if we talk about logan and it comes in
10 times but we have apparently not time

764
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
10 times but we have apparently not time
 

765
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,710
10 times but we have apparently not time
much praying and have we so let's come

766
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
much praying and have we so let's come
 

767
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,710
much praying and have we so let's come
back to this block area we stop 100 250

768
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
back to this block area we stop 100 250
 

769
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,310
back to this block area we stop 100 250
reduce 25 reduce 24 reduce to 12 and

770
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
reduce 25 reduce 24 reduce to 12 and
 

771
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,829
reduce 25 reduce 24 reduce to 12 and
reduce to 1. what's next

772
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839

 

773
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,990

so yeah what's next

774
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
so yeah what's next
 

775
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,990
so yeah what's next
see yeah right now okay you're paying

776
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
see yeah right now okay you're paying
 

777
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,350
see yeah right now okay you're paying
attention good

778
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
attention good
 

779
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,870
attention good
okay so let's multiply okay the

780
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
okay so let's multiply okay the
 

781
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,350
okay so let's multiply okay the
any question so far no

782
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
any question so far no
 

783
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,230
any question so far no
okay

784
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
okay
 

785
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,310
okay
okay so can you tell me what's identity

786
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
okay so can you tell me what's identity
 

787
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,150
okay so can you tell me what's identity
magic

788
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
magic
 

789
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,069
magic
what's identity match which part is to

790
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
what's identity match which part is to
 

791
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,550
what's identity match which part is to
setting this identity matrix which part

792
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:40,560
setting this identity matrix which part
 

793
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,389
setting this identity matrix which part
this part this part

794
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,399
this part this part
 

795
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,790
this part this part
this one which bar

796
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
this one which bar
 

797
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,910
this one which bar
this fire yeah yeah okay and what's this

798
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
this fire yeah yeah okay and what's this
 

799
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,629
this fire yeah yeah okay and what's this
battery what if i'm and one

800
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639

 

801
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,990

it's to checking when n is even or

802
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
it's to checking when n is even or
 

803
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,430
it's to checking when n is even or
number here

804
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
number here
 

805
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,870
number here
yeah

806
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
yeah
 

807
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,550
yeah
that's a question what

808
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
that's a question what
 

809
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,110
that's a question what
n is even or all number

810
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
n is even or all number
 

811
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,150
n is even or all number
n and one

812
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160

 

813
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,550

if it's an odd number that we times it

814
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
if it's an odd number that we times it
 

815
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,829
if it's an odd number that we times it
one time and we what's this doing

816
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
one time and we what's this doing
 

817
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,509
one time and we what's this doing
