yeah okay so today a task is very simple
 

7
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,390
yeah okay so today a task is very simple
this is an easy question right just to

8
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
this is an easy question right just to
 

9
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,070
this is an easy question right just to
get you familiar with the same text

10
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
get you familiar with the same text
 

11
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,789
get you familiar with the same text
again okay so given a list of numbers

12
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
again okay so given a list of numbers
 

13
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,750
again okay so given a list of numbers
one three five

14
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:17,760
one three five
 

15
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,830
one three five
okay all these numbers these numbers are

16
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
okay all these numbers these numbers are
 

17
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,310
okay all these numbers these numbers are
you know uh if if the length let's say

18
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,320
you know uh if if the length let's say
 

19
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,790
you know uh if if the length let's say
zero maybe not

20
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800

 

21
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,830

three okay

22
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:35,840
three okay
 

23
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,910
three okay
so all these num look how many elements

24
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
so all these num look how many elements
 

25
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,750
so all these num look how many elements
are here how many elements

26
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
are here how many elements
 

27
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,110
are here how many elements
four elements four okay so n equals four

28
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
four elements four okay so n equals four
 

29
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,750
four elements four okay so n equals four
okay let's say

30
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
okay let's say
 

31
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,630
okay let's say
n equals four and all these numbers are

32
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
n equals four and all these numbers are
 

33
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,150
n equals four and all these numbers are
between

34
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,160
between
 

35
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,670
between
zero to n okay remember this

36
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
zero to n okay remember this
 

37
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,790
zero to n okay remember this
is the why does why why does

38
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
is the why does why why does
 

39
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,850
is the why does why why does
um a list and then a tree

40
00:00:59,850 --> 00:00:59,860

43
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,910

this is mathematic this means that

44
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
this is mathematic this means that
 

45
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,510
this is mathematic this means that
inclusive remember this is

46
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
inclusive remember this is
 

47
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,590
inclusive remember this is
exclusive so it's bigger than zero

48
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
exclusive so it's bigger than zero
 

49
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,310
exclusive so it's bigger than zero
bigger or equal than zero

50
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
bigger or equal than zero
 

51
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,749
bigger or equal than zero
yeah that's number x smaller than n

52
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
yeah that's number x smaller than n
 

53
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,789
yeah that's number x smaller than n
that's what you mean

54
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
that's what you mean
 

55
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,789
that's what you mean
if this is the square bracket it means

56
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
if this is the square bracket it means
 

57
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,990
if this is the square bracket it means
that inclusive

58
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
that inclusive
 

59
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,830
that inclusive
if this is the uh well let's call it

60
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840
if this is the uh well let's call it
 

61
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,950
if this is the uh well let's call it
uh parentheses our bracket is it doesn't

62
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
uh parentheses our bracket is it doesn't
 

63
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,429
uh parentheses our bracket is it doesn't
have

64
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
have
 

65
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,630
have
this inclusive right it's exclusive

66
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
this inclusive right it's exclusive
 

67
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,429
this inclusive right it's exclusive
so what what i mean is that if n n is

68
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:35,439
so what what i mean is that if n n is
 

69
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,749
so what what i mean is that if n n is
the number of elements in the array

70
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
the number of elements in the array
 

71
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,670
the number of elements in the array
and n is four and all these values are

72
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
and n is four and all these values are
 

73
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,749
and n is four and all these values are
this have this range yeah we gonna all

74
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
this have this range yeah we gonna all
 

75
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,270
this have this range yeah we gonna all
equal and zero and smaller n

76
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
equal and zero and smaller n
 

77
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,429
equal and zero and smaller n
okay and then what we want to do to

78
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
okay and then what we want to do to
 

79
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,310
okay and then what we want to do to
transform it

80
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
transform it
 

81
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,590
transform it
as two so what's

82
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
as two so what's
 

83
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,630
as two so what's
index two zero one 2 so it's here

84
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
index two zero one 2 so it's here
 

85
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,469
index two zero one 2 so it's here
one zero one index one is here

86
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
one zero one index one is here
 

87
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,590
one zero one index one is here
yellow two

88
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
yellow two
 

89
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,789
yellow two
two and then three got it

90
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
two and then three got it
 

91
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,229
two and then three got it
yeah that's it today stars

92
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
yeah that's it today stars
 

93
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,550
yeah that's it today stars
do they get it these are the indexes and

94
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
do they get it these are the indexes and
 

95
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,750
do they get it these are the indexes and
i want to

96
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
i want to
 

97
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,030
i want to
what if you can't find the index yes

98
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
what if you can't find the index yes
 

99
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,949
what if you can't find the index yes
you can that's why i said these values

100
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
you can that's why i said these values
 

101
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,229
you can that's why i said these values
are within this range

102
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
are within this range
 

103
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,270
are within this range
so it's the index indexes there right

104
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
so it's the index indexes there right
 

105
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,790
so it's the index indexes there right
okay if it's one million you can find

106
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
okay if it's one million you can find
 

107
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,670
okay if it's one million you can find
this in one

108
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
this in one
 

109
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,190
this in one
yeah in a way right that's what i'm

110
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
yeah in a way right that's what i'm
 

111
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,949
yeah in a way right that's what i'm
saying okay

112
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:28,959
saying okay
 

113
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,070
saying okay
okay okay okay so any idea how we're

114
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
okay okay okay so any idea how we're
 

115
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,190
okay okay okay so any idea how we're
doing this

116
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
doing this
 

117
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,830
doing this
is simple form it's very simple yeah

118
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
is simple form it's very simple yeah
 

119
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,990
is simple form it's very simple yeah
it's very so basically you start with

120
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
it's very so basically you start with
 

121
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,430
it's very so basically you start with
zero

122
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
zero
 

123
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,910
zero
and plus one to the next one and plus

124
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
and plus one to the next one and plus
 

125
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,990
and plus one to the next one and plus
one

126
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
one
 

127
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,270
one
so what do you mean and all these

128
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
so what do you mean and all these
 

129
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,430
so what do you mean and all these
numbers are distinct means that they are

130
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
numbers are distinct means that they are
 

131
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,270
numbers are distinct means that they are
you know they are they are not duplicate

132
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
you know they are they are not duplicate
 

133
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,710
you know they are they are not duplicate
they are the same and they

134
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
they are the same and they
 

135
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,270
they are the same and they
they are not duplicate yeah like unique

136
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
they are not duplicate yeah like unique
 

137
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,509
they are not duplicate yeah like unique
yeah you can only find one

138
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
yeah you can only find one
 

139
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,630
yeah you can only find one
yeah the same okay

140
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
yeah the same okay
 

141
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,830
yeah the same okay
so what we do is we want to transform

142
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
so what we do is we want to transform
 

143
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,509
so what we do is we want to transform
the nums nums

144
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
the nums nums
 

145
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,550
the nums nums
i why the new numbers are

146
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
i why the new numbers are
 

147
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,750
i why the new numbers are
is to noms is for

148
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
is to noms is for
 

149
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,670
is to noms is for
nums

150
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680

 

151
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,170

yeah so that's the transformation yeah

152
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,180
yeah so that's the transformation yeah
 

153
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,750
yeah so that's the transformation yeah

so can you tell me how to buy it if i

160
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
so can you tell me how to buy it if i
 

161
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,910
so can you tell me how to buy it if i
let's say f

162

163
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,710

okay so in order to return it we need to

164
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
okay so in order to return it we need to
 

165
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,910
okay so in order to return it we need to
create a

166
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
create a
 

167
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:47,820
create a
answer which is what also equals zero

168
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:47,830

this is the value
 

303
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,909
this is the value

and then we use the value as the index
 

305
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,350

difference yeah
 

323
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,670
difference yeah
yeah and if it's the index you need to

324
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
yeah and if it's the index you need to
 

325
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,070
yeah and if it's the index you need to
use the nums i to get the value

326
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
use the nums i to get the value
 

327
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,750
use the nums i to get the value
right and this is already well i'll get

328
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
right and this is already well i'll get
 

329
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,589
right and this is already well i'll get
it at the index correct

330
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
it at the index correct
 

331
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,670
it at the index correct
okay okay so why at least one method

332
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
okay okay so why at least one method
 

333
00:08:45,680 --> 00:09:11,509
okay okay so why at least one method
okay just buy every one message i mean
