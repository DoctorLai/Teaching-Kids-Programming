okay so today
 

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,630
okay so today
we're going to talk about the how to

8
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
we're going to talk about the how to
 

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,029
we're going to talk about the how to
search

10
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,039
search
 

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,670
search
a value in a binary search tree so do

12
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,680
a value in a binary search tree so do
 

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,950
a value in a binary search tree so do
you still remember what's

14
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
you still remember what's
 

15
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,150
you still remember what's
binary tree or binary search tree

16
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
binary tree or binary search tree
 

17
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:43,670
binary tree or binary search tree
binary binary tree yeah

18
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680

 

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,630

right each parent have animals two kids

20
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
right each parent have animals two kids
 

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,270
right each parent have animals two kids
this tree

22
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
this tree
 

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,670
this tree
like upside down this is the root this

24
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
like upside down this is the root this
 

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,630
like upside down this is the root this
is the leaf

26
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
is the leaf
 

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,310
is the leaf
yeah a leaf is leaf

28
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
yeah a leaf is leaf
 

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,069
yeah a leaf is leaf
the leaf is unknown without any children

30
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
the leaf is unknown without any children
 

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,510
the leaf is unknown without any children
right yeah how many goats can a

32
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
right yeah how many goats can a
 

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,950
right yeah how many goats can a
tree have one

34
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
tree have one
 

35
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,830
tree have one
yeah one that's the root and yeah and

36
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
yeah one that's the root and yeah and
 

37
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,270
yeah one that's the root and yeah and
then you can have many

38
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
then you can have many
 

39
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,789
then you can have many
leaves yeah this is like the tree yeah

40
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
leaves yeah this is like the tree yeah
 

41
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,230
leaves yeah this is like the tree yeah
okay and these are

42
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
okay and these are
 

43
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,109
okay and these are
this is a leaf this is also a leaf leaf

44
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
this is a leaf this is also a leaf leaf
 

45
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,789
this is a leaf this is also a leaf leaf
leaf this is

46
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
leaf this is
 

47
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,910
leaf this is
just a normal note it's not it's not a

71
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,270

do you still remember the left nose are

72
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
do you still remember the left nose are
 

73
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,590
do you still remember the left nose are
always smaller than the parents the

74
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
always smaller than the parents the
 

75
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,109
always smaller than the parents the
right notes are always

76
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
right notes are always
 

77
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,309
right notes are always
bigger than the parents like this

78
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
bigger than the parents like this
 

79
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,990
bigger than the parents like this
is like 10 right and these will be

80
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
is like 10 right and these will be
 

81
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,070
is like 10 right and these will be
smaller that will be a and this will be

82
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
smaller that will be a and this will be
 

83
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,190
smaller that will be a and this will be
bigger nine

84
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
bigger nine
 

85
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,949
bigger nine
and this will be six maybe this will be

86
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
and this will be six maybe this will be
 

87
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,750
and this will be six maybe this will be
well maybe at least put it no this is 11

88
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
well maybe at least put it no this is 11
 

89
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,550
well maybe at least put it no this is 11
right

90
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
right
 

91
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,150
right
bigger than that and then this would be

92
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
bigger than that and then this would be
 

93
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,070
bigger than that and then this would be
nice something like that okay

94
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
nice something like that okay
 

95
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,949
nice something like that okay
right yeah smaller always smaller what

96
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
right yeah smaller always smaller what
 

97
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,110
right yeah smaller always smaller what
that one's flipping

98
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
that one's flipping
 

99
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,190
that one's flipping
right it doesn't matter as long as it's

100
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
right it doesn't matter as long as it's
 

101
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,110
right it doesn't matter as long as it's
smaller this is always smaller the less

102
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
smaller this is always smaller the less
 

103
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,630
smaller this is always smaller the less
notes are always smaller than the

104
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
notes are always smaller than the
 

105
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,430
notes are always smaller than the
parents

106
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
parents
 

107
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,509
parents
but right now it's always bigger than uh

108
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
but right now it's always bigger than uh
 

109
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,350
but right now it's always bigger than uh
uh bigger than the parents right but

110
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
uh bigger than the parents right but
 

111
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,190
uh bigger than the parents right but
look at this it's nice it's also smaller

112
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
look at this it's nice it's also smaller
 

113
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,309
look at this it's nice it's also smaller
than 10 right

114
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
than 10 right
 

115
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,390
than 10 right
so what does it mean it means that if we

116
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
so what does it mean it means that if we
 

117
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,430
so what does it mean it means that if we
want to search

118
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
want to search
 

119
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,710
want to search
9 we compare the root is it smaller

120
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
9 we compare the root is it smaller
 

121
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,790
9 we compare the root is it smaller
bigger

122
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
bigger
 

123
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,990
bigger
smaller so which way does it go

124
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
smaller so which way does it go
 

125
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,430
smaller so which way does it go
way it's smaller

126
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
way it's smaller
 

127
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,630
way it's smaller
nice smaller than 10. that way yeah so

128
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
nice smaller than 10. that way yeah so
 

129
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,910
nice smaller than 10. that way yeah so
it should be smaller

130
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
it should be smaller
 

131
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,869
it should be smaller
it should be somewhere here right it's

132
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
it should be somewhere here right it's
 

133
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,869
it should be somewhere here right it's
not bigger than eight

134
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
not bigger than eight
 

135
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,110
not bigger than eight
yes so it's somewhere in the right hand

136
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
yes so it's somewhere in the right hand
 

137
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,110
yes so it's somewhere in the right hand
street right because the right

138
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
street right because the right
 

139
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,030
street right because the right
children is always bigger than the

140
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
children is always bigger than the
 

141
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,710
children is always bigger than the
parents right

142
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
parents right
 

143
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,149
parents right
okay so this is the final

144
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
okay so this is the final
 

145
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,309
okay so this is the final
three so how how we search it we first

146
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
three so how how we search it we first
 

147
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,470
three so how how we search it we first
of all define the class

148
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
of all define the class
 

149
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,910
of all define the class
class three

150
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
class three
 

151
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,030
class three
yeah well what's missing here column

152
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
yeah well what's missing here column
 

153
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,670
yeah well what's missing here column
yeah and then we can define a

154
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
yeah and then we can define a
 

155
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,830
yeah and then we can define a
constructor and remember constructor

156
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
constructor and remember constructor
 

157
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,070
constructor and remember constructor
initialization and

158
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
initialization and
 

159
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,869
initialization and
we can have a this is the self and then

160
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
we can have a this is the self and then
 

161
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,589
we can have a this is the self and then
we have to

162
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
we have to
 

163
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,869
we have to
have a value right and then we can have

164
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
have a value right and then we can have
 

165
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,869
have a value right and then we can have
a left

166
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
a left
 

167
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,070
a left
and we can have a right

168
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
and we can have a right
 

169
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,550
and we can have a right
if we don't specify left and right we

170
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
if we don't specify left and right we
 

171
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,190
if we don't specify left and right we
can give it

172
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
can give it
 

173
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,630
can give it
a default parameter which is we can call

174
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
a default parameter which is we can call
 

175
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,910
a default parameter which is we can call
it left

176
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
it left
 

177
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,509
it left
you know left we can write left

178
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
you know left we can write left
 

179
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,830
you know left we can write left
equals num

180
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840

 

181
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,550

it means if you don't specify a value

182
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
it means if you don't specify a value
 

183
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,430
it means if you don't specify a value
for

184
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
for
 

185
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,430
for
for left or right you will be

186
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
for left or right you will be
 

187
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,030
for left or right you will be
initialized to

188
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
initialized to
 

189
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,150
initialized to
nothing none okay so

190
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
nothing none okay so
 

191
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,430
nothing none okay so
then now we can have this self

192
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
then now we can have this self
 

193
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,469
then now we can have this self
dot value

194
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
dot value
 

195
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,830
dot value
equals value serve the

196
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
equals value serve the
 

197
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,350
equals value serve the
left equals left yeah and what's human

198
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
left equals left yeah and what's human
 

199
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,230
left equals left yeah and what's human
writing yes

200
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
writing yes
 

201
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,270
writing yes
left over right right

202
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
left over right right
 

203
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,749
left over right right
equals right yeah so that means that the

204
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
equals right yeah so that means that the
 

205
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,350
equals right yeah so that means that the
tree has three

206
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
tree has three
 

207
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,590
tree has three
three things one a dot yeah a three note

208
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
three things one a dot yeah a three note
 

209
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,870
three things one a dot yeah a three note
has one one value yeah

210
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
has one one value yeah
 

211
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,830
has one one value yeah
it has a value and you also have two

212
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
it has a value and you also have two
 

213
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,350
it has a value and you also have two
things to point to its

214
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
things to point to its
 

215
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,150
things to point to its
kids it could be nothing 24 is nothing

216
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
kids it could be nothing 24 is nothing
 

217
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,950
kids it could be nothing 24 is nothing
right

218
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
right
 

219
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,710
right
yeah because nothing

220
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720

 

221
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,189

no so so it means that you can specify

222
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
no so so it means that you can specify
 

223
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,830
no so so it means that you can specify
the left

224
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
the left
 

225
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,350
the left
kids or like it right right yeah

226
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
kids or like it right right yeah
 

227
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,749
kids or like it right right yeah
okay so how can we search it

228
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759

 

229
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,469

define for when we write and

230
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479

 

231
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,469

yes it's like true or false true

tea right they are constant new york
 

255
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,870
tea right they are constant new york
okay so search in the binary tree

256
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
okay so search in the binary tree
 

257
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,150
okay so search in the binary tree
let's call it search right and we take a

258
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
let's call it search right and we take a
 

259
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,590
let's call it search right and we take a
parameter root

260
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
parameter root
 

261
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,150
parameter root
this is the root of the tree eric do

262
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
this is the root of the tree eric do
 

263
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,350
this is the root of the tree eric do
double tree

264
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
double tree
 

265
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,790
double tree
and we want to search the value right

266
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
and we want to search the value right
 

267
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,110
and we want to search the value right
search the value we're searching for

268
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
search the value we're searching for
 

269
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,990
search the value we're searching for
values

270
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
values
 

271
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,790
values
yeah so how do you do this how do we do

272
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
yeah so how do you do this how do we do
 

273
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,189
yeah so how do you do this how do we do
this

274
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
this
 

275
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,830
this
yeah if if if the root is nothing if

276
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
yeah if if if the root is nothing if
 

277
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,070
yeah if if if the root is nothing if
it's

278
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
it's
 

279
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,870
it's
you giving me a number right then if

280
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
you giving me a number right then if
 

281
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,390
you giving me a number right then if
root

282
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
root
 

283
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,670
root
is number it's long look

284
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
is number it's long look
 

285
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,070
is number it's long look
if the root is numb we return first

286
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
if the root is numb we return first
 

287
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,230
if the root is numb we return first
means we can't find it right

288
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
means we can't find it right
 

289
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,590
means we can't find it right
all right yeah

290
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
all right yeah
 

291
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,270
all right yeah
okay then if the value

292
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
okay then if the value
 

293
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,189
okay then if the value
is smaller than root

294
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
is smaller than root
 

295
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,670
is smaller than root
top value right the value remember the

296
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
top value right the value remember the
 

297
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,270
top value right the value remember the
tree has the value yeah

298
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
tree has the value yeah
 

299
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,870
tree has the value yeah
so what do we do now if the look value

300
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
so what do we do now if the look value
 

301
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,790
so what do we do now if the look value
is smaller than this three remember

302
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
is smaller than this three remember
 

303
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,990
is smaller than this three remember
which is this

304
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
which is this
 

305
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,909
which is this
is a right the right one

306
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
is a right the right one
 

307
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,629
is a right the right one
now this is 10 we are looking for we are

308
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
now this is 10 we are looking for we are
 

309
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,550
now this is 10 we are looking for we are
looking for nine

310
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
looking for nine
 

311
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,189
looking for nine
the root the root is in ten then we go

312
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
the root the root is in ten then we go
 

313
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,070
the root the root is in ten then we go
to the left

314
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
to the left
 

315
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,550
to the left
okay so look return this is the magic

316
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
okay so look return this is the magic
 

317
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,990
okay so look return this is the magic
return

318
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
return
 

319
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,110
return
search we call the function

320
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
search we call the function
 

321
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,990
search we call the function
blue dot left right blue dot left we are

322
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
blue dot left right blue dot left we are
 

323
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,589
blue dot left right blue dot left we are
searching the left tree

324
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
searching the left tree
 

325
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,629
searching the left tree
with the value right so what do we do

326
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
with the value right so what do we do
 

327
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,830
with the value right so what do we do
we can read don't

328
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
we can read don't
 

329
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,270
we can read don't
write not yet because

330
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
write not yet because
 

331
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,790
write not yet because
yeah you're quite close remember we

332
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
yeah you're quite close remember we
 

333
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,870
yeah you're quite close remember we
haven't talked about when it's equal

334
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
haven't talked about when it's equal
 

335
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,869
haven't talked about when it's equal
right yeah so if value

336
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
right yeah so if value
 

337
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,350
right yeah so if value
equal equal to the value

338
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
equal equal to the value
 

339
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,710
equal equal to the value
return one value

340
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
return one value
 

341
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,790
return one value
now we already slide it we turn two of

342
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
now we already slide it we turn two of
 

343
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,990
now we already slide it we turn two of
us between two of us

344
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
us between two of us
 

345
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,430
us between two of us
okay i know what what was written here

346
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
okay i know what what was written here
 

347
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,230
okay i know what what was written here
return

348
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240

 

349
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,629

no no yeah we we're talking about

350
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
no no yeah we we're talking about
 

351
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,390
no no yeah we we're talking about
smaller network

352
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
smaller network
 

353
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,110
smaller network
we don't write value

354
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
we don't write value
 

355
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,230
we don't write value
we're done you see so in this case we

356
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
we're done you see so in this case we
 

357
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,790
we're done you see so in this case we
always

358
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
always
 

359
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,710
always
you know when it's smaller we search the

360
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
you know when it's smaller we search the
 

361
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,469
you know when it's smaller we search the
left tree when it's

362
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
left tree when it's
 

363
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,950
left tree when it's
equal we can please we can move this

364
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
equal we can please we can move this
 

365
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,670
equal we can please we can move this
be right awesome oh good job good job

366
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
be right awesome oh good job good job
 

367
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,230
be right awesome oh good job good job
yeah

368
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
yeah
 

369
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,430
yeah
yeah my mistake yeah and then

370
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
yeah my mistake yeah and then
 

371
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,269
yeah my mistake yeah and then
this can go here as well right it

372
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
this can go here as well right it
 

373
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,589
this can go here as well right it
doesn't matter the the sequence

374
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
doesn't matter the the sequence
 

375
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,070
doesn't matter the the sequence
right if it's smaller we search the left

376
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
right if it's smaller we search the left
 

377
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,790
right if it's smaller we search the left
tray if it's

378
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
tray if it's
 

379
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,190
tray if it's
bigger we search the right way otherwise

380
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
bigger we search the right way otherwise
 

381
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,190
bigger we search the right way otherwise
it should be equal right

382
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
it should be equal right
 

383
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,070
it should be equal right
yeah then it's if it's equal then we

384
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
yeah then it's if it's equal then we
 

385
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,509
yeah then it's if it's equal then we
found it return true

386
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
found it return true
 

387
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,790
found it return true
uh if if we even find the rule

388
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
uh if if we even find the rule
 

389
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,670
uh if if we even find the rule
remember if this is the leaf node right

390
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
remember if this is the leaf node right
 

391
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,630
remember if this is the leaf node right
and it's still not equal to the value

392
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
and it's still not equal to the value
 

393
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,750
and it's still not equal to the value
then you will go

394
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
then you will go
 

395
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,949
then you will go
to leave no dot left or right leave

396
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
to leave no dot left or right leave
 

397
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,910
to leave no dot left or right leave
no dot left because leaf node does not

398
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
no dot left because leaf node does not
 

399
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,470
no dot left because leaf node does not
have

400
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
have
 

401
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,990
have
kids so leave no doubt left

402
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
kids so leave no doubt left
 

403
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,430
kids so leave no doubt left
or top right will be none right

404
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
or top right will be none right
 

405
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,829
or top right will be none right
i'm right yeah well and then you call

406
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
i'm right yeah well and then you call
 

407
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,350
i'm right yeah well and then you call
this function again and lose

408
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
this function again and lose
 

409
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,630
this function again and lose
is none what what happened to return

410
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
is none what what happened to return
 

411
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,590
is none what what happened to return
force false

412
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
force false
 

413
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,630
force false
you get it enough value gets propagated

414
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
you get it enough value gets propagated
 

415
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,310
you get it enough value gets propagated
and then you will return first this is

416
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
and then you will return first this is
 

417
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,150
and then you will return first this is
recursive do you understand

418
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
recursive do you understand
 

419
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,310
recursive do you understand
recursion yeah we talked about that on

420
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
recursion yeah we talked about that on
 

421
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,550
recursion yeah we talked about that on
the lesson one recursion

422
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
the lesson one recursion
 

423
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,630
the lesson one recursion
okay so we can also do this using

424
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:35,640
okay so we can also do this using
 

425
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,870
okay so we can also do this using
non-recursive method this will be

426
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
non-recursive method this will be
 

427
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,470
non-recursive method this will be
look will be something similar look why

428
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
look will be something similar look why
 

429
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,389
look will be something similar look why
yeah we're using the white root yeah

430
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
yeah we're using the white root yeah
 

431
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,590
yeah we're using the white root yeah
this is the root

432
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
this is the root
 

433
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,430
this is the root
okay this is the root we are here right

434
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
okay this is the root we are here right
 

435
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,030
okay this is the root we are here right
why root is not long right

436
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
why root is not long right
 

437
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,150
why root is not long right
it's not noun

438
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
it's not noun
 

439
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,150
it's not noun
while is not long now we compare e

440
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
while is not long now we compare e
 

441
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,310
while is not long now we compare e
is what value look equals

442
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
is what value look equals
 

443
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,550
is what value look equals
it doesn't matter a rule of value right

444
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
it doesn't matter a rule of value right
 

445
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,430
it doesn't matter a rule of value right
then what

446
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
then what
 

447
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,790
then what
what what we should do here

448
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
what what we should do here
 

449
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,230
what what we should do here
we found a value

450
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240

 

451
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,350

return one two right yeah we found a

452
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
return one two right yeah we found a
 

453
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,230
return one two right yeah we found a
value

454
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
value
 

455
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,230
value
if value is smaller than root of value

456
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240

 

457
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,230

what should we do now if it's smaller so

458
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
what should we do now if it's smaller so
 

459
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,790
what should we do now if it's smaller so
no no if it's smaller

460
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800

 

461
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,350

go to the left look this is magic we we

462
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
go to the left look this is magic we we
 

463
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:37,829
go to the left look this is magic we we
can

464
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
can
 

465
00:10:37,839 --> 00:11:00,949
can
we can do this blue equal loo

466
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:00,959

 

467
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,870

yeah we are done because after this we

468
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
yeah we are done because after this we
 

469
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,550
yeah we are done because after this we
still can't find the

470
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
still can't find the
 

471
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,230
still can't find the
value then it must not be in the

472
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
value then it must not be in the
 

473
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,470
value then it must not be in the
yeah in the tree right he looks like

474
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
yeah in the tree right he looks like
 

475
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,829
yeah in the tree right he looks like
that he looks like an e

476
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
that he looks like an e
 

477
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,750
that he looks like an e
do you get it it's easy yeah this is the

478
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
do you get it it's easy yeah this is the
 

479
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,190
do you get it it's easy yeah this is the
way to search

480
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
way to search
 

481
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,470
way to search
okay so the complexity

482
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480

 

483
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:31,990

oh it's already been 11 minutes

484
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000

 

485
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,949

every time i cut it in half yeah yeah

486
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:34,959
every time i cut it in half yeah yeah
 

487
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,829
every time i cut it in half yeah yeah
it's already been 11 minutes and 37

488
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
it's already been 11 minutes and 37
 

489
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,069
it's already been 11 minutes and 37
seconds

490
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
seconds
 

491
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,190
seconds
that's good five okay there's a special

492
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
that's good five okay there's a special
 

493
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,310
that's good five okay there's a special
case

494
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
case
 

495
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,470
case
look listen what what's the special okay

496
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
look listen what what's the special okay
 

497
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,150
look listen what what's the special okay
look this is good i mean

498
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
look this is good i mean
 

499
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,550
look this is good i mean
look look at if there are eight notes

500
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
look look at if there are eight notes
 

501
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,910
look look at if there are eight notes
right

502
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
right
 

503
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,389
right
or they are one two three four five six

504
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
or they are one two three four five six
 

505
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,670
or they are one two three four five six
seven notes

506
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680
seven notes
 

507
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,389
seven notes
yeah and on average it needs the three

508
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
yeah and on average it needs the three
 

509
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,190
yeah and on average it needs the three
times right

510
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
times right
 

511
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,990
times right
one two three one two three one two

512
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
one two three one two three one two
 

513
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,509
one two three one two three one two
three one two three yeah

514
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
three one two three yeah
 

515
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,550
three one two three yeah
do you get it if there's seven notes o

516
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
do you get it if there's seven notes o
 

517
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,670
do you get it if there's seven notes o
log seven is approximately three yeah

518
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
log seven is approximately three yeah
 

519
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,030
log seven is approximately three yeah
approximately three

520
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
approximately three
 

521
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,190
approximately three
so it means it needs three hundred yeah

522
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
so it means it needs three hundred yeah
 

523
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,230
so it means it needs three hundred yeah
but how about

524
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
but how about
 

525
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,710
but how about
if this is called a highly balanced

526
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
if this is called a highly balanced
 

527
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,430
if this is called a highly balanced
finalist

528
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
finalist
 

529
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,910
finalist
tree means that but what what if a tree

530
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
tree means that but what what if a tree
 

531
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,030
tree means that but what what if a tree
is by balance

532
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
is by balance
 

533
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,829
is by balance
you know the balance you have balance it

534
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:23,839
you know the balance you have balance it
 

535
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,190
you know the balance you have balance it
means that

536
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
means that
 

537
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,550
means that
that at any level any number

538
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
that at any level any number
 

539
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,350
that at any level any number
left the minimum and the right uh the

540
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
left the minimum and the right uh the
 

541
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,629
left the minimum and the right uh the
three levels

542
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
three levels
 

543
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,629
three levels
the difference is smaller than one

544
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
the difference is smaller than one
 

545
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,829
the difference is smaller than one
that's called highly balanced

546
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
that's called highly balanced
 

547
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,629
that's called highly balanced
if this is not a balance look this is

548
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
if this is not a balance look this is
 

549
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,750
if this is not a balance look this is
not a balance tree

550
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
not a balance tree
 

551
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,030
not a balance tree
we don't have a left left kid we always

552
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
we don't have a left left kid we always
 

553
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,790
we don't have a left left kid we always
have the right kids

554
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
have the right kids
 

555
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,509
have the right kids
yeah do you get it this is not highly

556
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
yeah do you get it this is not highly
 

557
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,550
yeah do you get it this is not highly
but this is not

558
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
but this is not
 

559
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,949
but this is not
balance at all so what happens is still

560
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
balance at all so what happens is still
 

561
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,069
balance at all so what happens is still
a tree it just doesn't have left kit

562
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
a tree it just doesn't have left kit
 

563
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,509
a tree it just doesn't have left kit
yeah so it's like a list and if we want

564
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
yeah so it's like a list and if we want
 

565
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,389
yeah so it's like a list and if we want
to find the value

566
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
to find the value
 

567
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,230
to find the value
in the worst case we need to go through

568
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
in the worst case we need to go through
 

569
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,829
in the worst case we need to go through
seven times yeah and that

570
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
seven times yeah and that
 

571
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,389
seven times yeah and that
in that case this will be o and m right

572
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
in that case this will be o and m right
 

573
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,310
in that case this will be o and m right
if the value is here like if

574
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
if the value is here like if
 

575
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,949
if the value is here like if
we have one two three four five six you

576
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
we have one two three four five six you
 

577
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,230
we have one two three four five six you
are finding the seven

578
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
are finding the seven
 

579
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,470
are finding the seven
and the computer needs to go through

580
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
and the computer needs to go through
 

581
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,069
and the computer needs to go through
each list

582
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
each list
 

583
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,910
each list
the value and he needs the seven times

584
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
the value and he needs the seven times
 

585
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,069
the value and he needs the seven times
right this is not balance but

586
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
right this is not balance but
 

587
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,069
right this is not balance but
when we talk about a better binary

588
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:20,079
when we talk about a better binary
 

589
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,150
when we talk about a better binary
search tree we have to talk about

590
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
search tree we have to talk about
 

591
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,629
search tree we have to talk about
balance if it's balanced if we structure

592
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
balance if it's balanced if we structure
 

593
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,670
balance if it's balanced if we structure
like this

594
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
like this
 

595
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,030
like this
then it's o log n if if it if it's not

596
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,040
then it's o log n if if it if it's not
 

597
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,829
then it's o log n if if it if it's not
balanced

598
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
balanced
 

599
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,230
balanced
it's o n right does it make sense

600
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
it's o n right does it make sense
 

601
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,949
it's o n right does it make sense
yeah doesn't make sense okay good luck

602
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
yeah doesn't make sense okay good luck
 

603
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,550
yeah doesn't make sense okay good luck
good job today

604
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560

 

605
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,279

oh yeah
