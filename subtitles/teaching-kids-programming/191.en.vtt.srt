hello hi hi hello mr erin mr ryan how

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
hello hi hi hello mr erin mr ryan how
 

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,390
hello hi hi hello mr erin mr ryan how
are you today

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
are you today
 

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,150
are you today
good okay so what's binary search tree

6
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
good okay so what's binary search tree
 

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,110
good okay so what's binary search tree
it's a tree with numbers and on the left

8
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,120
it's a tree with numbers and on the left
 

9
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,990
it's a tree with numbers and on the left
side

10
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
side
 

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,030
side
is smaller than the roots and on the

12
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040
is smaller than the roots and on the
 

13
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,310
is smaller than the roots and on the
right side is bigger

14
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320

 

15
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,349

you need to be apparent what you need to

16
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
you need to be apparent what you need to
 

17
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:23,590
you need to be apparent what you need to
be

18
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,600
be
 

19
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,189
be
preparing not just

20
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199

 

21
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:43,190

it's not just

22
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200

 

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,190

is basically the value tree but the

24
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
is basically the value tree but the
 

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,430
is basically the value tree but the
numbers the notes on the left hand side

26
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
numbers the notes on the left hand side
 

27
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,430
numbers the notes on the left hand side
is strictly smaller than the parent

28
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
is strictly smaller than the parent
 

29
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,110
is strictly smaller than the parent
and the right hand side is strictly

30
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
and the right hand side is strictly
 

31
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,910
and the right hand side is strictly
bigger than right so

32
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:53,920
bigger than right so
 

33
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,670
bigger than right so
in in the final research tree they are

34
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
in in the final research tree they are
 

35
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,350
in in the final research tree they are
not

36
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
not
 

37
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,510
not
they are unique numbers so it means that

38
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
they are unique numbers so it means that
 

39
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,950
they are unique numbers so it means that
there can't be any

40
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
there can't be any
 

41
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,310
there can't be any
uh duplicate numbers right all right

42
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
uh duplicate numbers right all right
 

43
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,390
uh duplicate numbers right all right
yeah so for example if you have four

44
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,400
yeah so for example if you have four
 

45
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,910
yeah so for example if you have four
another four you can't put it in the

46
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
another four you can't put it in the
 

47
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,350
another four you can't put it in the
binary okay

48
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
binary okay
 

49
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,190
binary okay
yeah so how many can you put a four

50
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
yeah so how many can you put a four
 

51
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,469
yeah so how many can you put a four
here and here four sorry four

52
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
here and here four sorry four
 

53
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,630
here and here four sorry four
no no no that's what i'm saying they are

54
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
no no no that's what i'm saying they are
 

55
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,830
no no no that's what i'm saying they are
all unique numbers

56
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
all unique numbers
 

57
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,270
all unique numbers
so you can imagine you have given a list

58
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
so you can imagine you have given a list
 

59
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,990
so you can imagine you have given a list
of

60
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
of
 

61
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,670
of
given three numbers for example one two

62
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
given three numbers for example one two
 

63
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,030
given three numbers for example one two
three how many kinds of how many

64
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
three how many kinds of how many
 

65
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,390
three how many kinds of how many
different ways of the

66
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
different ways of the
 

67
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,230
different ways of the
binary search three one two three

68
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
binary search three one two three
 

69
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,670
binary search three one two three
it's not unique right you're gonna put a

70
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
it's not unique right you're gonna put a
 

71
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,590
it's not unique right you're gonna put a
two here all right this is one

72
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
two here all right this is one
 

73
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,830
two here all right this is one
three yeah yeah or you can put a one

74
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,840
three yeah yeah or you can put a one
 

75
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,749
three yeah yeah or you can put a one
two three yeah

76
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
two three yeah
 

77
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,830
two three yeah
oh you can put a three here can you put

78
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
oh you can put a three here can you put
 

79
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,230
oh you can put a three here can you put
a three

80
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240

 

81
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,350

two one right yeah

82
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
two one right yeah
 

83
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,510
two one right yeah
so as you can see there are three ways

84
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
so as you can see there are three ways
 

85
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,230
so as you can see there are three ways
right maybe more i don't know

86
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
right maybe more i don't know
 

87
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,270
right maybe more i don't know
could there be more two one three yeah

88
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
could there be more two one three yeah
 

89
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,550
could there be more two one three yeah
or yeah so they're basically

90
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
or yeah so they're basically
 

91
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,830
or yeah so they're basically
three okay

92
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
three okay
 

93
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,190
three okay
because the pre-order right pre-order

94
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
because the pre-order right pre-order
 

95
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,830
because the pre-order right pre-order
pre-order is the sorting right for

96
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
pre-order is the sorting right for
 

97
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,270
pre-order is the sorting right for
example pre-order is one two three

98
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
example pre-order is one two three
 

99
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,869
example pre-order is one two three
pre-orders one two three

100
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
pre-orders one two three
 

101
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,350
pre-orders one two three
two dollars traversal okay all right

102
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
two dollars traversal okay all right
 

103
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,350
two dollars traversal okay all right
does it make sense

104
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
does it make sense
 

105
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,869
does it make sense
put all the services what what's with

106
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
put all the services what what's with
 

107
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,790
put all the services what what's with
the other terminator

108
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
the other terminator
 

109
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,710
the other terminator
i like build it like definite search way

110
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
i like build it like definite search way
 

111
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,110
i like build it like definite search way
yeah but which is the left tree and the

112
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
yeah but which is the left tree and the
 

113
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,550
yeah but which is the left tree and the
note and the right right

114
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560

 

115
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,830

left left right right left

116
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
left left right right left
 

117
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,030
left left right right left
blue and right if there's right

118
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
blue and right if there's right
 

119
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,550
blue and right if there's right
let's read right left

120
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
let's read right left
 

121
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,509
let's read right left
note right pre-order the pre-order of a

122
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
note right pre-order the pre-order of a
 

123
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:43,910
note right pre-order the pre-order of a
question

124
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
question
 

125
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,949
question
i think that's in order oh

126
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
i think that's in order oh
 

127
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,290
i think that's in order oh
yeah you are right you know yeah we got

128
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:51,300

 

129
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:59,509

[Music]

130
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519

 

131
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,190

so it's actually uh pre-order is 2

132
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200
so it's actually uh pre-order is 2
 

133
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,190
so it's actually uh pre-order is 2
one two it's not what we are looking for

134
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
one two it's not what we are looking for
 

135
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,470
one two it's not what we are looking for
is what it should be

136
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
is what it should be
 

137
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,949
is what it should be
left no right in order okay let's know

138
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
left no right in order okay let's know
 

139
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,550
left no right in order okay let's know
so in order of

140
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
so in order of
 

141
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,350
so in order of
binary search tree is give a circuit at

142
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
binary search tree is give a circuit at
 

143
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,830
binary search tree is give a circuit at
least

144
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
least
 

145
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,509
least
am right okay okay so today's task is

146
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
am right okay okay so today's task is
 

147
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,149
am right okay okay so today's task is
very simple

148
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
very simple
 

149
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,350
very simple
given a new number like for example yeah

150
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
given a new number like for example yeah
 

151
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,750
given a new number like for example yeah
let's say i just leave this point this

152
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
let's say i just leave this point this
 

153
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,949
let's say i just leave this point this
is true okay

154
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
is true okay
 

155
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,630
is true okay
give a new number four

156
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640

 

157
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,990

insert it into a binary search tree

158
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
insert it into a binary search tree
 

159
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,589
insert it into a binary search tree
okay we'll just make it for the same

160
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
okay we'll just make it for the same
 

161
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,309
okay we'll just make it for the same
you just i you just please note here

162
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
you just i you just please note here
 

163
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,550
you just i you just please note here
somewhere and make it a

164
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
somewhere and make it a
 

165
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,470
somewhere and make it a
new binary search tree it has to be a

166
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
new binary search tree it has to be a
 

167
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,149
new binary search tree it has to be a
new binary

168
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
new binary
 

169
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,229
new binary
okay any idea how we're doing this

170
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
okay any idea how we're doing this
 

171
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,430
okay any idea how we're doing this
how do we insert it so for example if i

172
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
how do we insert it so for example if i
 

173
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,710
how do we insert it so for example if i
want to put the four here where where

174
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
want to put the four here where where
 

175
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,190
want to put the four here where where
are you going

176
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
are you going
 

177
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,830
are you going
see there can be lots of boxes yeah

178
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
see there can be lots of boxes yeah
 

179
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,030
see there can be lots of boxes yeah
that's our answer but

180
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
that's our answer but
 

181
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,429
that's our answer but
look at the easy way pick the easy way

182
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
look at the easy way pick the easy way
 

183
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,949
look at the easy way pick the easy way
let's fall this is the brightness

184
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
let's fall this is the brightness
 

185
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,190
let's fall this is the brightness
tree yeah of course if you want to put

186
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
tree yeah of course if you want to put
 

187
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,470
tree yeah of course if you want to put
that it could be

188
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
that it could be
 

189
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,630
that it could be
if you change the root you it could be

190
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
if you change the root you it could be
 

191
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,509
if you change the root you it could be
what

192
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
what
 

193
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,589
what
it could be if i three four

194
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
it could be if i three four
 

195
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,630
it could be if i three four
two one right right if i

196
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
two one right right if i
 

197
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,189
two one right right if i
give you a four this is original tree

198
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
give you a four this is original tree
 

199
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,069
give you a four this is original tree
right

200
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
right
 

201
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,150
right
you can tell me it's this one that's

202
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
you can tell me it's this one that's
 

203
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,749
you can tell me it's this one that's
okay but it's too complicated you're

204
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
okay but it's too complicated you're
 

205
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,189
okay but it's too complicated you're
changing the loot right

206
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
changing the loot right
 

207
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,590
changing the loot right
so all i want to do is what you put

208
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
so all i want to do is what you put
 

209
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,310
so all i want to do is what you put
these four

210
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
these four
 

211
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,950
these four
somewhere here without changing the

212
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
somewhere here without changing the
 

213
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,310
somewhere here without changing the
existing

214
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320

215
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,909
existing
binary search tree yeah

216
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
binary search tree yeah
 

217
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,110
binary search tree yeah
so if you get it if i tell you if

218
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
so if you get it if i tell you if
 

219
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,749
so if you get it if i tell you if
it's what if i tell you you want to put

220
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
it's what if i tell you you want to put
 

221
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,510
it's what if i tell you you want to put
a zero

222
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
a zero
 

223
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,270
a zero
yeah so where do we put it without

224
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
yeah so where do we put it without
 

225
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,469
yeah so where do we put it without
changing these three numbers

226
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
changing these three numbers
 

227
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,070
changing these three numbers
where down yeah you see so so how are we

228
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
where down yeah you see so so how are we
 

229
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,430
where down yeah you see so so how are we
doing this

230
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440

 

231
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,350

oh one point five oh one point five i

232
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
oh one point five oh one point five i
 

233
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,629
oh one point five oh one point five i
wanted to put this

234
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
wanted to put this
 

235
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,909
wanted to put this
one point five where to put this

236
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
one point five where to put this
 

237
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,350
one point five where to put this
why don't we put it without changing

238
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
why don't we put it without changing
 

239
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,830
why don't we put it without changing
only three

240
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
only three
 

241
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,830
only three
yeah you got it yeah so easy

242
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
yeah you got it yeah so easy
 

243
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,790
yeah you got it yeah so easy
what's the approach you're going to take

244
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
what's the approach you're going to take
 

245
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,670
what's the approach you're going to take
1.5

246
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
1.5
 

247
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,710
1.5
is it bigger or smaller than can what if

248
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:14,720
is it bigger or smaller than can what if
 

249
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,590
is it bigger or smaller than can what if
we

250
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
we
 

251
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,870
we
cannot do it without changing it that's

252
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
cannot do it without changing it that's
 

253
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,629
cannot do it without changing it that's
not possible because we can always

254
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
not possible because we can always
 

255
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,350
not possible because we can always
change it

256
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
change it
 

257
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,550
change it
right why is that look 1.5 is

258
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:24,560
right why is that look 1.5 is
 

259
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,350
right why is that look 1.5 is
bigger or smaller than 2.

260
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
bigger or smaller than 2.
 

261
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,110
bigger or smaller than 2.
so it should be on the left hand three

262
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
so it should be on the left hand three
 

263
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,469
so it should be on the left hand three
right so i go here

264
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
right so i go here
 

265
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,590
right so i go here
is one is it bigger or smaller bigger

266
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
is one is it bigger or smaller bigger
 

267
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,950
is one is it bigger or smaller bigger
bigger so i put it here easy

268
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
bigger so i put it here easy
 

269
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,430
bigger so i put it here easy
got it yeah okay so

270
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440

 

271
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,990

so that will be easier define what you

272
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
so that will be easier define what you
 

273
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,550
so that will be easier define what you
know that

274
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
know that
 

275
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,690
know that
because you just did two yeah

276
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:50,700

301
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,700

okay then what if the value in this

306
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
okay then what if the value in this
 

307
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,790
okay then what if the value in this
value

308
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
value
 

309
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,230
value
is bigger than current load yeah so

310
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
is bigger than current load yeah so
 

311
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,710
is bigger than current load yeah so
where are we gonna put it

312
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
where are we gonna put it
 

313
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,670
where are we gonna put it
this is this is the root like a 2 if the

314
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
this is this is the root like a 2 if the
 

315
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,909
this is this is the root like a 2 if the
value i'm going to put is 3

316
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
value i'm going to put is 3
 

317
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,990
value i'm going to put is 3
so if 3 is bigger than 2 what should i

318
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
so if 3 is bigger than 2 what should i
 

319
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,710
so if 3 is bigger than 2 what should i
put what should i put

there are eight seven notes yeah so the

398
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
there are eight seven notes yeah so the

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,150
there are eight seven notes yeah so the

three seven is roughly three three yeah

402
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:53,839
three seven is roughly three three yeah
 

403
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,470
three seven is roughly three three yeah
not seven

404
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
not seven
 

405
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,110
not seven
three okay it's highly balanced and can

406
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
three okay it's highly balanced and can
 

407
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,949
three okay it's highly balanced and can
you give me an example

408
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
you give me an example
 

409
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,430
you give me an example
yeah yeah one more thing can you tell me

410
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
yeah yeah one more thing can you tell me
 

411
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,230
yeah yeah one more thing can you tell me
this

412
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
this
 

413
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,590

if it's unbalanced okay
 

415
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,509
if it's unbalanced okay
can you give me draw a very very

416
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
can you give me draw a very very
 

417
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,670
can you give me draw a very very
unbalanced final research tree

418
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
unbalanced final research tree
 

419
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,509
unbalanced final research tree
you wonder yeah like one

420
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
you wonder yeah like one
 

421
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,230
you wonder yeah like one
two is like this there so there's no

422
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
two is like this there so there's no
 

423
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,949
two is like this there so there's no
advantage

do you get it why we wanted it why

428
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
do you get it why we wanted it why
 

429
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,030
do you get it why we wanted it why
why we prefer the balance instead of

430
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
why we prefer the balance instead of
 

431
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,590
why we prefer the balance instead of
unbalanced because because when you

432
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
unbalanced because because when you
 

433
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,110
unbalanced because because when you
start you abandon

434
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
start you abandon
 

435
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,110
start you abandon
half of it yeah and for this one i'm

436
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
half of it yeah and for this one i'm
 

437
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,829
half of it yeah and for this one i'm
balanced we cannot abandon half right we

438
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
balanced we cannot abandon half right we
 

439
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,430
balanced we cannot abandon half right we
if we only fight four

440
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
if we only fight four
 

441
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,430
if we only fight four
we always go one direction there's only

442
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
we always go one direction there's only
 

443
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,949
we always go one direction there's only
one possibility right

00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
one possibility right
 

445
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,710
one possibility right
so if there are n notes in the worst

446
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
so if there are n notes in the worst
 

447
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,550
so if there are n notes in the worst
cases

448

cases
 

449
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,710

yeah and if there are n notes the
 

451
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,590

unbalanced surgery is what
 

459
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,430
unbalanced surgery is what
and if it's highly balanced finding the

yeah that's why we want the highly

464
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
yeah that's why we want the highly
 

465
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,310

okay let's do it okay does it make sense
 

469
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,550
okay let's do it okay does it make sense
yes yeah okay

470
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
yes yeah okay
 

471
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,949
yes yeah okay
okay what even what

472
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959

 

473
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,190

if that note is what then we want to go

474
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
if that note is what then we want to go
 

475
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,389
if that note is what then we want to go
to the right

476
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399

 

477
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,350

i don't know what what what why in what

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
i don't know what what what why in what
 

479
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,870
i don't know what what what why in what
cases we are going to the

480
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
cases we are going to the
 

481
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,910

500
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320

 

501
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,190

which is uh bigger yeah we can write it
