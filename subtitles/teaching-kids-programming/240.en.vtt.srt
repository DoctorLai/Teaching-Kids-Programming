1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470

hello hello hello mr ariel all right

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:04,480
hello hello hello mr ariel all right
 

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,749
hello hello hello mr ariel all right
a long time ago we talked about

4
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:05,759
a long time ago we talked about
 

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,070
a long time ago we talked about
apprentices yeah fantasies so given the

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
apprentices yeah fantasies so given the
 

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,350
apprentices yeah fantasies so given the
parenthesis

8
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
parenthesis
 

9
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,430
parenthesis
how do we check if it's a valid if it

10
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
how do we check if it's a valid if it
 

11
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,470
how do we check if it's a valid if it
comes with a pair

12
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
comes with a pair
 

13
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,150
comes with a pair
so this is not right yeah and

14
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
so this is not right yeah and
 

15
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,429
so this is not right yeah and
this is what not

16
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439

 

17
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,429

at least is yeah

18
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
at least is yeah
 

19
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,589
at least is yeah
and this is nice okay so how can we do

20
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:29,599
and this is nice okay so how can we do
 

21
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,029
and this is nice okay so how can we do
it i need one correct

22
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
it i need one correct
 

23
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,069
it i need one correct
yeah how can we do it we um use that

24
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
yeah how can we do it we um use that
 

25
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,510
yeah how can we do it we um use that
balance that we um we use the counter

26
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
balance that we um we use the counter
 

27
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,150
balance that we um we use the counter
to count if it's opening if it's opening

28
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
to count if it's opening if it's opening
 

29
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,869
to count if it's opening if it's opening
a plus one

30
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
a plus one
 

31
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,430
a plus one
closing minus one if any time it falls

32
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
closing minus one if any time it falls
 

33
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,790
closing minus one if any time it falls
below zero

34
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
below zero
 

35
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,229
below zero
then it's not right yeah yeah so look

36
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
then it's not right yeah yeah so look
 

37
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,270
then it's not right yeah yeah so look
plus one minus one is zero one

38
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
plus one minus one is zero one
 

39
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,510
plus one minus one is zero one
zero one and at the end we need to check

40
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
zero one and at the end we need to check
 

41
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,869
zero one and at the end we need to check
it with zero

42
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
it with zero
 

43
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,310
it with zero
right this is minus one now

44
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
right this is minus one now
 

45
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,590
right this is minus one now
one zero one zero that's good zero

46
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
one zero one zero that's good zero
 

47
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,789
one zero one zero that's good zero
one zero one no because at the end it

48
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
one zero one no because at the end it
 

49
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,990
one zero one no because at the end it
needs to be zero okay

50
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
needs to be zero okay
 

51
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,149
needs to be zero okay
so today's tasks are a little bit

52
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
so today's tasks are a little bit
 

53
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,710
so today's tasks are a little bit
similar but different quite similar okay

54
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
similar but different quite similar okay
 

55
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,350
similar but different quite similar okay
so we are given a pair

56
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360

 

57
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,469

so you need to keep tell me the longest

58
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
so you need to keep tell me the longest
 

59
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,109
so you need to keep tell me the longest
the longest longest valid

60
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
the longest longest valid
 

61
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,550
the longest longest valid
valid subsequent uh the quantities

62
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
valid subsequent uh the quantities
 

63
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,710
valid subsequent uh the quantities
pairs so quantities per subsequence yeah

64
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
pairs so quantities per subsequence yeah
 

65
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,460
pairs so quantities per subsequence yeah
what's the subsequence

66
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:36,470
what's the subsequence
 

67
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,910
what's the subsequence
[Music]

68
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920

 

69
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,109

so long is valid subsequent so

70
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
so long is valid subsequent so
 

71
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,550
so long is valid subsequent so
which one this one this one

72
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
which one this one this one
 

73
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,510
which one this one this one
this one yes so that's six one two three

74
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
this one yes so that's six one two three
 

75
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,389
this one yes so that's six one two three
four five six

76
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
four five six
 

77
00:01:52,399 --> 00:02:01,590
four five six
okay got

78
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600

 

79
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:14,630

how many

80
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640

 

81
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,150

yeah how about the one bigger than that

82
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
yeah how about the one bigger than that
 

83
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,470
yeah how about the one bigger than that
how about this oh yeah yeah so so well

84
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
how about this oh yeah yeah so so well
 

85
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,710
how about this oh yeah yeah so so well
yeah so let's the longest would be

86
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
yeah so let's the longest would be
 

87
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,350
yeah so let's the longest would be
six right yeah

88
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
six right yeah
 

89
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:40,869
six right yeah
you you return the number of parentheses

90
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879

 

91
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,470

exactly because we want to find out the

92
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
exactly because we want to find out the
 

93
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,550
exactly because we want to find out the
number of pairs right so it needs to be

94
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
number of pairs right so it needs to be
 

95
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,390
number of pairs right so it needs to be
an even number that's a good catch

96
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
an even number that's a good catch
 

97
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,949
an even number that's a good catch
so how can we do this how can we do this

98
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
so how can we do this how can we do this
 

99
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:49,670
so how can we do this how can we do this
any idea

100
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
any idea
 

101
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:58,390
any idea
it's quite similar so so we any idea

102
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400

 

103
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,550

so before if it's negative it will

104
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
so before if it's negative it will
 

105
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,309
so before if it's negative it will
counter it's negative we just return

106
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
counter it's negative we just return
 

107
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,350
counter it's negative we just return
faster because that

108
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
faster because that
 

109
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,589
faster because that
at the beginning the previous task is

110
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
at the beginning the previous task is
 

111
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,550
at the beginning the previous task is
was checking the

112
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
was checking the
 

113
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,790
was checking the
the string with the red parentheses but

114
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
the string with the red parentheses but
 

115
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,670
the string with the red parentheses but
now we are

116
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
now we are
 

117
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,710
now we are
we need to find out the number of the

118
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
we need to find out the number of the
 

119
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,750
we need to find out the number of the
valid pairs

120
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
valid pairs
 

121
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,470
valid pairs
so it's if it's negative we just ignore

122
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
so it's if it's negative we just ignore
 

123
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,309
so it's if it's negative we just ignore
continue negative

124
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
continue negative
 

125
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,270
continue negative
ignore continue and set it to zero right

126
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
ignore continue and set it to zero right
 

127
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,949
ignore continue and set it to zero right
and then we start here one

128
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
and then we start here one
 

129
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,229
and then we start here one
right one two

130
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
right one two
 

131
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,589
right one two
right okay now if i mean this

132
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
right okay now if i mean this
 

133
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,270
right okay now if i mean this
closing parenthesis what does it mean we

134
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
closing parenthesis what does it mean we
 

135
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,710
closing parenthesis what does it mean we
increment we decrement

136
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
increment we decrement
 

137
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,030
increment we decrement
to one right so if we still above zero

138
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
to one right so if we still above zero
 

139
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,710
to one right so if we still above zero
about equal zero

140
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
about equal zero
 

141
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,949
about equal zero
what does it mean if we have a if we add

142
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
what does it mean if we have a if we add
 

143
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,309
what does it mean if we have a if we add
this point

144
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
this point
 

145
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,589
this point
we are not violating the balance count

146
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
we are not violating the balance count
 

147
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,750
we are not violating the balance count
the balance is still above or equal to

148
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
the balance is still above or equal to
 

149
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,509
the balance is still above or equal to
zero after we inc

150
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
zero after we inc
 

151
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,830
zero after we inc
equipment one what does it mean it means

152
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
equipment one what does it mean it means
 

153
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,869
equipment one what does it mean it means
we already

154
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
we already
 

155
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,390
we already
have a corresponding pair right yeah

156
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
have a corresponding pair right yeah
 

157
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,429
have a corresponding pair right yeah
okay yeah in order to be

158
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
okay yeah in order to be
 

159
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,869
okay yeah in order to be
valid it has to be come in patch compare

160
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
valid it has to be come in patch compare
 

161
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,910
valid it has to be come in patch compare
right

162
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
right
 

163
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,390
right
you have a closing one so there must be

164
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
you have a closing one so there must be
 

165
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,670
you have a closing one so there must be
a opening one

166
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
a opening one
 

167
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,110
a opening one
got it right right

168
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
got it right right
 

169
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,390
got it right right
yeah okay so now this is

170
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
yeah okay so now this is
 

171
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,629
yeah okay so now this is
now the quarter is one yeah the counter

172
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
now the quarter is one yeah the counter
 

173
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,990
now the quarter is one yeah the counter
the answer

174
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
the answer
 

175
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,509
the answer
answer is one okay and the balance will

176
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
answer is one okay and the balance will
 

177
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,350
answer is one okay and the balance will
be one the balance will be one

178
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
be one the balance will be one
 

179
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,070
be one the balance will be one
and here two balance will be two right

180
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
and here two balance will be two right
 

181
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,830
and here two balance will be two right
but we're not doing anything to answer

182
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
but we're not doing anything to answer
 

183
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,790
but we're not doing anything to answer
because we're not meeting uh closing

184
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
because we're not meeting uh closing
 

185
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,909
because we're not meeting uh closing
minus one balance will be one and the

186
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
minus one balance will be one and the
 

187
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,110
minus one balance will be one and the
answer will plus one

188
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
answer will plus one
 

189
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,510
answer will plus one
all right balance will be zero

190
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
all right balance will be zero
 

191
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,670
all right balance will be zero
yeah answer plus one so left three

192
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
yeah answer plus one so left three
 

193
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,110
yeah answer plus one so left three
quantities

194
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
quantities
 

195
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,270
quantities
times two is six okay

196
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280

 

197
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,590

does it make sense yeah it looks like

198
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
does it make sense yeah it looks like
 

199
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,950
does it make sense yeah it looks like
it's time seven

200
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
it's time seven
 

201
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,390
it's time seven
yes okay so

202
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
yes okay so
 

203
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,790
yes okay so
can you repeat what i'm saying just make

204
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
can you repeat what i'm saying just make
 

205
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,070
can you repeat what i'm saying just make
sure you understand oh

206
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
sure you understand oh
 

207
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,950
sure you understand oh
because it times two at the end yeah

208
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
because it times two at the end yeah
 

209
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,189
because it times two at the end yeah
yeah but how can we count how many yeah

210
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
yeah but how can we count how many yeah
 

211
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,790
yeah but how can we count how many yeah
they say that say that firstly

212
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
they say that say that firstly
 

213
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,550
they say that say that firstly
um if it goes below zero it's um

214
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
um if it goes below zero it's um
 

215
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,550
um if it goes below zero it's um
we set it back to zero from them next

216
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
we set it back to zero from them next
 

217
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,110
we set it back to zero from them next
it's like one and plus one again that's

218
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
it's like one and plus one again that's
 

219
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,909
it's like one and plus one again that's
two

220
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
two
 

221
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,310
two
and then and what cases uh what do we

222
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
and then and what cases uh what do we
 

223
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,029
and then and what cases uh what do we
mean

224
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
mean
 

225
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,310
mean
when do we plus the answers if

226
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
when do we plus the answers if
 

227
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,510
when do we plus the answers if
if um that is a

228
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
if um that is a
 

229
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,629
if um that is a
is bigger than zero and we need um this

230
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
is bigger than zero and we need um this
 

231
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,230
is bigger than zero and we need um this
closing yeah yeah what would be the

232
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
closing yeah yeah what would be the
 

233
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,070
closing yeah yeah what would be the
closing we increment because if we move

234
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
closing we increment because if we move
 

235
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,550
closing we increment because if we move
the cur

236
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
the cur
 

237
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,790
the cur
opening we don't don't know if they are

238
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
opening we don't don't know if they are
 

239
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,590
opening we don't don't know if they are
closing right

240
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
closing right
 

241
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,550
closing right
so look this is yellow right equivalent

242
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
so look this is yellow right equivalent
 

243
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,350
so look this is yellow right equivalent
counter

244
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
counter
 

245
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,590
counter
one two three right the the patterns

246
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
one two three right the the patterns
 

247
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,590
one two three right the the patterns
count one two three but we don't know

248
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
count one two three but we don't know
 

249
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,070
count one two three but we don't know
if lay less uh closing if we mean here

250
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
if lay less uh closing if we mean here
 

251
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,629
if lay less uh closing if we mean here
yeah so we we add the one we need

252
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
yeah so we we add the one we need
 

253
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,749
yeah so we we add the one we need
another one

254
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
another one
 

255
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,510
another one
we added one we need another one

256
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
we added one we need another one
 

257
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,029
we added one we need another one
everyone okay

258
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
everyone okay
 

259
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,070
everyone okay
yeah that's how it works okay

260
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
yeah that's how it works okay
 

261
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,430
yeah that's how it works okay
doesn't make sense yeah okay so okay

262
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
doesn't make sense yeah okay so okay
 

263
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,110
doesn't make sense yeah okay so okay
let's run it anytime you want to write

264
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
let's run it anytime you want to write
 

265
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,510
let's run it anytime you want to write
okay

266
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
okay
 

267
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,350
okay
define longest

268
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
define longest
 

269
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,909
define longest
subsequent valid valid parenthesis okay

270
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
subsequent valid valid parenthesis okay
 

271
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,070
subsequent valid valid parenthesis okay
when parenthesis

272
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
when parenthesis
 

273
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,270
when parenthesis
s so we have an answer

274
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
s so we have an answer
 

275
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,110
s so we have an answer
and we also need to a balance yeah a

276
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
and we also need to a balance yeah a
 

277
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,309
and we also need to a balance yeah a
balanced counter

278
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
balanced counter
 

279
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,510
balanced counter
which at the beginning set to one

280
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
which at the beginning set to one
 

281
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,830
which at the beginning set to one
zero answer equals balance because okay

282
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
zero answer equals balance because okay
 

283
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,189
zero answer equals balance because okay
and then for

284
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
and then for
 

285
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,950
and then for
i in s we go through each

286
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
i in s we go through each
 

287
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,309
i in s we go through each
each characters in a parenthesis string

288
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
each characters in a parenthesis string
 

289
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,909
each characters in a parenthesis string
if i is opening

290
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
if i is opening
 

291
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,110
if i is opening
what should we do

292
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120

 

293
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,150

plus one here one plus one balance plus

294
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
plus one here one plus one balance plus
 

295
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,870
plus one here one plus one balance plus
one

296
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
one
 

297
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,790
one
plus equation as here is the

298
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
plus equation as here is the
 

299
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,749
plus equation as here is the
if if this string only contains the

300
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
if if this string only contains the
 

301
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,189
if if this string only contains the
opening and closing

302
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
opening and closing
 

303
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,870
opening and closing
so we don't need to check if it's

304
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
so we don't need to check if it's
 

305
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,790
so we don't need to check if it's
closing because if it's not

306
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
closing because if it's not
 

307
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,350
closing because if it's not
if it's equal to opening is here errors

308
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
if it's equal to opening is here errors
 

309
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,029
if it's equal to opening is here errors
it should be the clos

310
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
it should be the clos
 

311
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,270
it should be the clos
here it should be the closing yeah yeah

312
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
here it should be the closing yeah yeah
 

313
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,189
here it should be the closing yeah yeah
right this is coming okay

314
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
right this is coming okay
 

315
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:26,629
right this is coming okay
that's what um

316
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639

 

317
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,200

we need to check if they obviously

318
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,210
we need to check if they obviously
 

319
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:42,870
we need to check if they obviously

come on tell me if look here
one and then zero yeah

324
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
one and then zero yeah
 

325
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,990
one and then zero yeah
what happened what happened to i said

326
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
what happened what happened to i said
 

327
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,350
what happened what happened to i said
yeah equal yeah then what happened

328
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
yeah equal yeah then what happened
 

329
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,550
yeah equal yeah then what happened
we plus one which one five one and the

330
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
we plus one which one five one and the
 

331
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,950
we plus one which one five one and the
plus equals one

332
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
plus equals one
 

333
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,270
plus equals one
and as if it's smaller than zero what

334
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
and as if it's smaller than zero what
 

335
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,869
and as if it's smaller than zero what
happened

336
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
happened
 

337
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,270
happened
if balance is smaller than zero zero

338
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
if balance is smaller than zero zero
 

339
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,710
if balance is smaller than zero zero
yeah we started to balance

340
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
yeah we started to balance
 

341
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,270
yeah we started to balance
here at this point right at this point

342
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
here at this point right at this point
 

343
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,629
here at this point right at this point
it means that at this point

344
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
it means that at this point
 

345
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,270
it means that at this point
the previous one does not count anymore

346
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
the previous one does not count anymore
 

347
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,830
the previous one does not count anymore
right

348
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
right
 

349
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,070
right
so we start with the new one so balance

350
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
so we start with the new one so balance
 

351
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,990
so we start with the new one so balance
equals zero

352
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
equals zero
 

353
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,749
equals zero
and return within

354
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759

 

355
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,909

okay what's the time complexity

356
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919

 

357
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,550

if there are any strings and characters

358
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
if there are any strings and characters
 

359
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:34,949
if there are any strings and characters
in

360
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
in
 

361
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,750
in
s what's the term complexity

362
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760

 

363
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,310

what's the space complexity

364
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320

 

365
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,310

and the one

366
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
and the one
 

367
00:08:50,320 --> 00:09:05,430
and the one
why you say oh and where is the space a1

368
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440

 

369
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:30,870

come on

370
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880

 

371
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:48,670

yeah okay

372
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:48,680

 

373
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,680

bye
