1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,359
hello mister hello mr ryan all right

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,640
okay so let's say we have a string

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,640
pattern yeah tiger

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,200
and then suppose this this string

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,719
repeats itself infinitive time what's

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,279
infinity

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,520
white tiger i know it doesn't matter oh

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,840
you can say eric yeah

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,199
okay okay let's change it to arie

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,439
i like it

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,000
which is the best oh yeah okay

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,840
environment as well yeah okay so eric

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,160
yeah

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,040
and it repeats itself yeah

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,760
why infinitive time

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,600
so if i say i equals rice

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,079
i equals three right j equals 10. so can

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,680
you tell me the substring the you know

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,320
the index from

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,160
three zero one two three here this is i

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
equals three

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,879
and then ten

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,079
ten you know so it's i up to j not

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,280
including j so it should the last index

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,640
to be included is nine right so that

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,920
three four five six seven eight nine

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,760
nine yeah

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,840
this is nine

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,119
and

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,040
ryan right so that would be this is jake

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,280
yeah so you need to tell me this dream

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,880
yeah character

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,920
make sense

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,680
yeah

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,840
yeah okay

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
this is an easy question so

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,799
what's your thoughts about solving this

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,320
i mean i mean this is what you did

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,079
obviously

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,320
that could be a solution that allowed to

41
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,479
be very you know

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,079
but the thing is that uh

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,520
we want to

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,079
how how do we find out because this

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,479
stream never it's not existing you can't

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,439
put these three in memory it's infinity

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,159
yeah

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,200
it's in infinity so we we don't have

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,880
this string and memory this is infinity

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,840
yeah we can't put this string in the

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,040
memory

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,040
so we need to do some math right so we

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,280
need to do some math so we can go

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,520
through this index but how do we like

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,239
the key thing today is that how do we

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,680
map the index to the original index all

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,239
we have is e-r-i-c this index right so

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,239
if i'm saying e-i-c-c

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,080
needs to map to this one

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,080
e needs to map to this character ah yeah

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,959
you see what we're doing

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,680
yeah

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,560
so we only have a copy

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,360
and we want to go to the range here for

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
i

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,440
in let's say for x in

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,560
range

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,599
we start with i up to j right so now we

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,640
have this index x but how do we map this

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,000
x to the original index

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,560
any idea that's the backspace

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
what but

73
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,000
oh well my question is this index x from

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,480
i to j how do we map this x to the

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
original guys because that's all we have

76
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,640
one copy so how do we make this x to

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,080
resist to here so so for example like

78
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,959
this is three four okay so here is four

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,879
five six seven eight how do we make this

80
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,920
seven two

81
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,599
two three

82
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,200
you just count um

83
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,959
yeah under the count how do we count i

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,760
mean this is c

85
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,519
i equals seven how do we make it zero

86
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,360
one two three

87
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,040
that's my question how do you remember

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:48,319
this okay another example e

89
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,239
when i equals a how do we map it to zero

90
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,799
do i need to give you more example of

91
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,040
this it's very obvious yeah we can't we

92
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,360
go around the table so what kind of

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,200
operator is this i'm trying to get this

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,599
thing out of your mouth

95
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,920
we go look dear one two three and then

96
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,879
back to yellow one two three a tl one

97
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,040
two three

98
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,040
so what operator is this come on

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,480
modulus

100
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,879
yes wow

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,000
i'm getting this yeah i'm almost giving

102
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,959
it up

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,519
okay

104
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,919
yeah modules so we can just do this

105
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,320
answer equals at the beginning we put in

106
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,560
the list then answer

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,720
a pen

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,919
a pen uh the original copy let's say s

109
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,040
s okay x modulus

110
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,199
modulus the length yeah the length of

111
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,199
s

112
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,600
okay and then now we can return this is

113
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,680
at least we need to convert it to a

114
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,800
string dot join

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,759
all right join answer

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,759
yeah

117
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
and that would be like easy question the

118
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,479
most important thing is this

119
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:02,280
module yeah easy

120
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,280
so we can even use the one line return

121
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,840
um

122
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,000
going on you're not explaining it just

123
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,199
repeating my question so my what's john

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,199
here what's john doing

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,400
it together can you give me an example

126
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,120
yeah

127
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,199
it's common sense yeah okay can you

128
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,320
explain to me like i'm a five-year-old

129
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,960
boy

130
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,960
what's going on

131
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,440
where does split okay ryan you're

132
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,610
listening yeah right okay so what's join

133
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,080
uh

134
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,319
[Music]

135
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,759
okay so

136
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,800
oh what's split

137
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,479
like

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,880
cut in here

139
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,720
yeah okay so look

140
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,160
hey

141
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
a

142
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,639
space a plus b plus c if this is a

143
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,520
string if i split it start split

144
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,280
split by a plus then you'll give me a

145
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,800
list array of

146
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,319
a

147
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,520
b

148
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,240
c yeah

149
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,639
this is called delimiter separator yeah

150
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,840
easy and then join look

151
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,880
i can say

152
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
uh

153
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,440
well i can say x

154
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,479
dot join

155
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,199
every

156
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,560
ryan so yeah tell me what what do we get

157
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,639
here eric doctor no no no this is x dot

158
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,960
join everything right so what do we get

159
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,880
eric x ryan

160
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,639
exactly yeah you'll understand it yeah

161
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,440
so you need to better

162
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,360
you know explanation i know you you

163
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,599
understand but

164
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,240
one skill right

165
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,240
one skill is to explain it to other

166
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,759
people who don't know it right this is a

167
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,560
very important skill do you understand

168
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,160
yeah

169
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,360
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

170
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,599
yeah

171
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,520
okay so another way of doing it yeah

172
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,160
another way of doing this

173
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,919
this eye because this eye could be very

174
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,440
big right so if we modulus this length

175
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,240
length s

176
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,080
then this is the starting position how

177
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,599
many characters we need to return is j j

178
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,639
minus i right

179
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,319
so if

180
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,720
this is the number of character we need

181
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,599
to return not that come on this is the

182
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,440
number of characters we need to return

183
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,280
my fluffy

184
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,440
what's j minor

185
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,560
uh so it's basically

186
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,560
what's j minor sign

187
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,720
what does it mean

188
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,080
it means

189
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,479
that you kind of search

190
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,240
so what's this number k minus i come on

191
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,199
it's very obvious what you're looking

192
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,440
for

193
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,440
three minus i what's the same what is it

194
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,759
what is a equal equals that green bar

195
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,479
the number of what characters of the

196
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,280
return string right yeah yeah yeah okay

197
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,879
so

198
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,720
if this is n

199
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,240
and then the time conditions are when

200
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,280
the space complexities are when

201
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,000
obviously yeah so what we're saying is

202
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,199
that i model that's the star and then we

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,519
can do this i okay i equals

204
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,399
i modulus equals modulus equal length s

205
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,880
right

206
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,200
then k this is the number of character

207
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,959
we need to return j minus i

208
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,080
and then we have a

209
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,680
we need to construct a string that's uh

210
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,040
you know let's just string that one not

211
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,120
infinity right so p equals

212
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,000
how many times k times then we can do

213
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,000
this s times k plus one time right now

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,640
we can just do this return

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,519
p

216
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,160
i

217
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,920
i plus k because there are k strings

218
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,440
there are k characters we need to return

219
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,959
f k is the number of characters and we

220
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,959
need to return from index i i has been

221
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,800
down this modulus

222
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,080
to i plus k

223
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,640
okay

224
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,800
okay that's one way of doing it okay

225
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,640
yeah enough for that will be for today

226
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,640
bye bye bye
