00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
good okay so today uh we talked about
 

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,669
good okay so today uh we talked about
the binary tree again so can you tell me

6
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
the binary tree again so can you tell me
 

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,549
the binary tree again so can you tell me
what's primary

8
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
what's primary
 

9
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,749
what's primary
uh binary tree what finally means what

10
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
uh binary tree what finally means what
 

11
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,030
uh binary tree what finally means what
is the dream

12
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040
is the dream
 

13
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,630
is the dream
just finally tree okay so it's a tree

14
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
just finally tree okay so it's a tree
 

15
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,070
just finally tree okay so it's a tree
no yeah where's that numbers numbers or

16
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
no yeah where's that numbers numbers or
 

17
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,189
no yeah where's that numbers numbers or
values which one is the root yeah

18
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
values which one is the root yeah
 

19
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,509
values which one is the root yeah
and then we got the leaves right okay

20
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,519
and then we got the leaves right okay
 

21
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,509
and then we got the leaves right okay
okay can you put something on the left

22
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
okay can you put something on the left
 

23
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,110
okay can you put something on the left
side okay it's

24
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
side okay it's
 

25
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,270
side okay it's
smaller than the ring let's find a

26
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
smaller than the ring let's find a
 

27
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,950
smaller than the ring let's find a
research tree we're talking about final

28
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
research tree we're talking about final
 

29
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,830
research tree we're talking about final
tree it doesn't

30
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:37,840
tree it doesn't
 

31
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,430
tree it doesn't
necessarily have this kind of property

32
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
necessarily have this kind of property
 

33
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,270
necessarily have this kind of property
okay so finally what's finally

34
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
okay so finally what's finally
 

35
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,630
okay so finally what's finally
what's primarily mean t two

00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
what's primarily mean t two
 

37
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,709
what's primarily mean t two
okay

okay okay okay but look yeah we're
making this elephant okay so let's say

96
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,360
making this elephant okay so let's say
 

97
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,270
making this elephant okay so let's say
we want given the binary tree we want to

98
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
we want given the binary tree we want to
 

99
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,550
we want given the binary tree we want to
make it anything

order right

122
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
order right
 

123
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,910
order right
definite search okay so the default

124
00:02:59,910 --> 00:02:59,920
definite search okay so the default
 

125
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,309
definite search okay so the default

search is better suited in this case
 

127
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,110
search is better suited in this case
and how can we do this when we we travel

128
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
and how can we do this when we we travel
 

129
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,229
and how can we do this when we we travel
a tree

130
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
a tree
 

131
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,270
a tree
yeah recursively and when we reach the

132
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
yeah recursively and when we reach the
 

133
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,790
yeah recursively and when we reach the
leaves

134
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
leaves
 

135
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,670
leaves
yeah so basically we can come up with a

136
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
yeah so basically we can come up with a
 

137
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,030
yeah so basically we can come up with a
function to return

138
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
function to return
 

139
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,430
function to return
remember return the sum do you still

140
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
remember return the sum do you still
 

141
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,070
remember return the sum do you still
remember we how how do we return the sum

142
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
remember we how how do we return the sum
 

143
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,270
remember we how how do we return the sum
of uh

144
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
of uh
 

145
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,229
of uh
three can we write that first okay so

146
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
three can we write that first okay so
 

147
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,270
three can we write that first okay so
then i tell you okay

148
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
then i tell you okay
 

149
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,550
then i tell you okay
look all right define let's say sum

150
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
look all right define let's say sum
 

151
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,789
look all right define let's say sum
okay so make sure you guys step out the

152
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
okay so make sure you guys step out the
 

153
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,509
okay so make sure you guys step out the
way okay

154
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
way okay
 

155
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,910
way okay
so how can we return the sound mary oh

156
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
so how can we return the sound mary oh
 

157
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,030

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,429

length because look this is calculating

172
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
length because look this is calculating
 

173
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,110
length because look this is calculating
the sum of the left branch

174
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
the sum of the left branch
 

175
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,870
the sum of the left branch
this is calculated in the sum of the

176
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
this is calculated in the sum of the
 

177
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,310
this is calculated in the sum of the
rubrics

178
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320

 

179
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,230

any time i see answers okay yeah because

180
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
any time i see answers okay yeah because
 

181
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,310
any time i see answers okay yeah because
i let me give you a name

182
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
i let me give you a name
 

183
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,590
i let me give you a name
answer okay look look here yeah

184
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
answer okay look look here yeah
 

185
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,150
answer okay look look here yeah
answer yeah answer is we take this

186
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
answer yeah answer is we take this
 

187
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,550
answer yeah answer is we take this
function return the sum

188
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
function return the sum
 

189
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,749
function return the sum
of the current tree right right

190
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
of the current tree right right
 

191
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,310
of the current tree right right
so all we have to do is what we're

192
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
so all we have to do is what we're
 

193
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,790
so all we have to do is what we're
changing this

194
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
changing this
 

195
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,670
changing this
root of value equals one

196
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680

 

197
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,189

and make it in decrease what is missing

198
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
and make it in decrease what is missing
 

199
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,189
and make it in decrease what is missing
here what is missing here all right

200
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
here what is missing here all right
 

201
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,189
here what is missing here all right
it equals the trend value

202
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
it equals the trend value
 

203
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,909
it equals the trend value
yeah return value yeah yeah does it make

204
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
yeah return value yeah yeah does it make
 

205
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:04,550
yeah return value yeah yeah does it make
sense yes

206
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
sense yes
 

207
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,310
sense yes
yeah answer answer all right

208
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320
yeah answer answer all right
 

209
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,150
yeah answer answer all right
why does doesn't make sense i know we

210
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
why does doesn't make sense i know we
 

211
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,350
why does doesn't make sense i know we
can just do this

212
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
can just do this
 

213
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,230
can just do this
um maybe we change it to dfs okay

214
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
um maybe we change it to dfs okay
 

215
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,950
um maybe we change it to dfs okay
definitely

216
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
definitely
 

217
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,590
definitely
okay and i will change this to default

218
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
okay and i will change this to default
 

219
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,950
okay and i will change this to default
search

220
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
search
 

221
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,909
search
does it make sense and then here

222
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
does it make sense and then here
 

223
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,350
does it make sense and then here
therefore

224
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
therefore
 

225
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,670
therefore
root okay and then return load yeah all

226
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
root okay and then return load yeah all
 

227
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,950
root okay and then return load yeah all
right

228
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
right
 

229
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,230
right
all right okay okay so this function

230
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
all right okay okay so this function
 

231
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,710
all right okay okay so this function
look at

232
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
look at
 

233
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,830
look at
this function

234
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840

 

235
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,790

if i remove this bit yeah if i remove

236
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
if i remove this bit yeah if i remove
 

237
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,950
if i remove this bit yeah if i remove
this spit what happens

238
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
this spit what happens
 

239
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,029
this spit what happens
if i remove this bit this is just

240
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
if i remove this bit this is just
 

241
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,110
if i remove this bit this is just
getting return the sum

242
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
getting return the sum
 

243
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,070
getting return the sum
of the loads all right so you'll be all

244
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
of the loads all right so you'll be all
 

245
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,710
of the loads all right so you'll be all
right look

246
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
right look
 

247
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,990
right look
you'll be like that one two three

248
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
you'll be like that one two three
 

249
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,430
you'll be like that one two three
and that'll be four that'll be five

250
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
and that'll be four that'll be five
 

251
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,029
and that'll be four that'll be five
so dfs root if i don't have less thing

252
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
so dfs root if i don't have less thing
 

253
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,550
so dfs root if i don't have less thing
it will return what will return

254
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
it will return what will return
 

255
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,790
it will return what will return
one plus two plus three plus four plus

256
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
one plus two plus three plus four plus
 

257
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,909
one plus two plus three plus four plus
five right

258
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
five right
 

259
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,510
five right
yeah you'll be returning 15 right yeah

260
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
yeah you'll be returning 15 right yeah
 

261
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,830
yeah you'll be returning 15 right yeah
so all i have to do is do the value

262
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
so all i have to do is do the value
 

263
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,870
so all i have to do is do the value
equals one value equals the value

264
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
equals one value equals the value
 

265
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,909
equals one value equals the value
answer yeah so if i change leads

266
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
answer yeah so if i change leads
 

267
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,950
answer yeah so if i change leads
that what happened so leads will not be

268
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
that what happened so leads will not be
 

269
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,510
that what happened so leads will not be
doing anything right yeah this will not

270
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
doing anything right yeah this will not
 

271
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,550
doing anything right yeah this will not
do the only thing

272
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
do the only thing
 

273
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,270
do the only thing
six yeah then you become six

274
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
six yeah then you become six
 

275
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,590
six yeah then you become six
and you'll become eight and then you'll

276
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
and you'll become eight and then you'll
 

277
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,029
and you'll become eight and then you'll
become 15

278
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
become 15
 

279
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,309
become 15
right doesn't make sense yeah so look

280
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
right doesn't make sense yeah so look
 

281
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,189
right doesn't make sense yeah so look
if we don't if we do this if we can do

282
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
if we don't if we do this if we can do
 

283
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,309
if we don't if we do this if we can do
this

284
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
this
 

285
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,830
this
answer equals to the value

286
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
answer equals to the value
 

287
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,950
answer equals to the value
and then look if lou don't left

288
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
and then look if lou don't left
 

289
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,670
and then look if lou don't left
right he would do the left with release

290
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
right he would do the left with release
 

291
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,950
right he would do the left with release
and then here

292
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
and then here
 

293
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,990
and then here
if do the right right we can do this

294
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
if do the right right we can do this
 

295
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,990
if do the right right we can do this
if left right is that going to listen to

296
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
if left right is that going to listen to
 

297
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,270
if left right is that going to listen to
this right let's make sure what's the

298
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
this right let's make sure what's the
 

299
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,830
this right let's make sure what's the
time complexity

300
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840
time complexity
 

301
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,780
time complexity
um

302
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:05,790

 

303
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:15,189

[Music]

304
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199

 

305
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,309

okay so have we talked about getting the

306
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
okay so have we talked about getting the
 

307
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,150
okay so have we talked about getting the
sum of uh

308
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
sum of uh
 

309
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,469
sum of uh
using this final step for search before

310
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
using this final step for search before
 

311
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,150
using this final step for search before
do we i am not sure that's what i'm

312
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
do we i am not sure that's what i'm
 

313
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,510
do we i am not sure that's what i'm
asking i mean do i have

314
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
asking i mean do i have
 

315
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,990
asking i mean do i have
have you heard this but you understand

316
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
have you heard this but you understand
 

317
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,710
have you heard this but you understand
this yeah

318
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
this yeah
 

319
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,870
this yeah
the only difference is adding this yeah

320
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
the only difference is adding this yeah
 

321
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,909
the only difference is adding this yeah
you see this is

322
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
you see this is
 

323
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,710
you see this is
the only difference because we need to

324
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
the only difference because we need to
 

325
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,350
the only difference because we need to
when we

326
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
when we
 

327
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,350
when we
get when we can because this answer at

328
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
get when we can because this answer at
 

329
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,870
get when we can because this answer at
this point

330
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
this point
 

331
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,469
this point
is the sum of all the notes

332
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
is the sum of all the notes
 

333
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,469
is the sum of all the notes
at least loot and below yeah all right

334
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
at least loot and below yeah all right
 

335
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,309
at least loot and below yeah all right
and then all i have to do is change

336
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
