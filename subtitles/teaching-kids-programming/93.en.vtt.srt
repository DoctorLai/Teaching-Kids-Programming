1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,230

hello mr

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,240
hello mr
 

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,269
hello mr
mr ryan how are you today good good okay

4
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:07,279
mr ryan how are you today good good okay
 

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:07,829
mr ryan how are you today good good okay
so

6
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
so
 

7
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,070
so
today we'll talk about some mathematics

8
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
today we'll talk about some mathematics
 

9
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,190
today we'll talk about some mathematics
no coding just mathematics okay so the

10
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
no coding just mathematics okay so the
 

11
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,870
no coding just mathematics okay so the
the combination and permutation so can

12
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
the combination and permutation so can
 

13
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,510
the combination and permutation so can
you tell me

14
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
you tell me
 

15
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,950
you tell me
which word you understand permutation

16
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960

 

17
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,950

p e r permutation

18
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
p e r permutation
 

19
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,870
p e r permutation
and combination

20
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
and combination
 

21
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,190
and combination
i think combination is putting things

22
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,200
i think combination is putting things
 

23
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,430
i think combination is putting things
together

24
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
together
 

25
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,910
together
yeah yeah it has that meaning too but in

26
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
yeah yeah it has that meaning too but in
 

27
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,590
yeah yeah it has that meaning too but in
mathematics it means something different

28
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600
mathematics it means something different
 

29
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,549
mathematics it means something different
combination

30
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
combination
 

31
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,790
combination
combining that's right a permutation

32
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
combining that's right a permutation
 

33
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,830
combining that's right a permutation
the different order of these

34
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
the different order of these
 

35
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,549
the different order of these
elements for example permutation if they

36
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
elements for example permutation if they
 

37
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,549
elements for example permutation if they
are one

38
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
are one
 

39
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,510
are one
two three so there are six permutations

40
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
two three so there are six permutations
 

41
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,510
two three so there are six permutations
no no no look permutation so different

42
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
no no no look permutation so different
 

43
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,950
no no no look permutation so different
orders

44
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
orders
 

45
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,029
orders
right right don't pull my thing okay

46
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
right right don't pull my thing okay
 

47
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,509
right right don't pull my thing okay
right look

48
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
right look
 

49
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,630
right look
one two three one three two

50
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
one two three one three two
 

51
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,070
one two three one three two
two one three two three one three one

52
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
two one three two three one three one
 

53
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,510
two one three two three one three one
two three two one you see so permutation

54
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
two three two one you see so permutation
 

55
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,230
two three two one you see so permutation
is the number of in the way in different

56
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
is the number of in the way in different
 

57
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,109
is the number of in the way in different
orders yeah

58
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
orders yeah
 

59
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,590
orders yeah
yeah so different all possibilities of

60
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
yeah so different all possibilities of
 

61
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,070
yeah so different all possibilities of
different orders of using these three

62
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
different orders of using these three
 

63
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,190
different orders of using these three
elements yes yeah and

64
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
elements yes yeah and
 

65
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,910
elements yes yeah and
combination is like there are three

66
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
combination is like there are three
 

67
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,710
combination is like there are three
numbers

68
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
numbers
 

69
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,990
numbers
how many ways to pick two

70
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
how many ways to pick two
 

71
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,230
how many ways to pick two
two of them the order does not match one

72
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
two of them the order does not match one
 

73
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,230
two of them the order does not match one
two is equals to one

74
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
two is equals to one
 

75
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,429
two is equals to one
so combination is that okay do you get

76
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
so combination is that okay do you get
 

77
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,469
so combination is that okay do you get
it

78
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
it
 

79
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,270
it
so how many ways if i want to pick two

80
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
so how many ways if i want to pick two
 

81
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,870
so how many ways if i want to pick two
out of these three elements how many

82
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
out of these three elements how many
 

83
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,270
out of these three elements how many
ways

84
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280

 

85
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,630

one two one three three

86
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
one two one three three
 

87
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,510
one two one three three
two three we are done okay so this is a

88
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
two three we are done okay so this is a
 

89
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,030
two three we are done okay so this is a
combination

90
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
combination
 

91
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,149
combination
so so let's say let's define two symbols

92
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
so so let's say let's define two symbols
 

93
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,789
so so let's say let's define two symbols
okay

94
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
okay
 

95
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,149
okay
p for permutation c for combination

96
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
p for permutation c for combination
 

97
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,590
p for permutation c for combination
yeah p and m

98
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
yeah p and m
 

99
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,790
yeah p and m
and c and n so c and m

100
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
and c and n so c and m
 

101
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,910
and c and n so c and m
is like i if they are n items

102
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
is like i if they are n items
 

103
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,910
is like i if they are n items
n equals 3 i want to pick 2

104
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
n equals 3 i want to pick 2
 

105
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,110
n equals 3 i want to pick 2
m equals 2 so now how many ways it would

106
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
m equals 2 so now how many ways it would
 

107
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,470
m equals 2 so now how many ways it would
be c

108
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
be c
 

109
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,990
be c
3 2 okay yes this is the function we

110
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
3 2 okay yes this is the function we
 

111
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,030
3 2 okay yes this is the function we
defined yeah

112
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
defined yeah
 

113
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,350
defined yeah
yeah and the same if it's p3 to what

114
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
yeah and the same if it's p3 to what
 

115
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,589
yeah and the same if it's p3 to what
does it mean

116
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
does it mean
 

117
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,830
does it mean
it means that three elements i want to

118
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
it means that three elements i want to
 

119
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,630
it means that three elements i want to
pick two

120
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
pick two
 

121
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,470
pick two
and permutate it so it will be

122
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
and permutate it so it will be
 

123
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,509
and permutate it so it will be
1 2 1 3 2

124
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
1 2 1 3 2
 

125
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,309
1 2 1 3 2
3 3 2 and 1

126
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
3 3 2 and 1
 

127
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,670
3 3 2 and 1
and no 1 2 two one

128
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
and no 1 2 two one
 

129
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,270
and no 1 2 two one
one three three one you see yeah

130
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
one three three one you see yeah
 

131
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,229
one three three one you see yeah
so first of all pick two and then

132
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:56,239
so first of all pick two and then
 

133
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,430
so first of all pick two and then
permutate it

134
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
permutate it
 

135
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,190
permutate it
yeah got it so

136
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
yeah got it so
 

137
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,509
yeah got it so
so um this

138
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
so um this
 

139
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,390
so um this
okay so for permutation p and

140
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400

 

141
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,430

m when m

142
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
m when m
 

143
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,390
m when m
is equals to one what does it mean there

144
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
is equals to one what does it mean there
 

145
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,869
is equals to one what does it mean there
are n

146
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
are n
 

147
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,430
are n
items i want to pick one animal how many

148
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
items i want to pick one animal how many
 

149
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,350
items i want to pick one animal how many
orders will there be

150
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
orders will there be
 

151
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,110
orders will there be
one p one m equals one last three apples

152
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
one p one m equals one last three apples
 

153
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,910
one p one m equals one last three apples
and i want to pick one apple and

154
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
and i want to pick one apple and
 

155
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,390
and i want to pick one apple and
communicate it how many ways

156
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400

 

157
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,789

how many other places three yes we're

158
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
how many other places three yes we're
 

159
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,509
how many other places three yes we're
done so p

160
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
done so p
 

161
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,350
done so p
and n when m equals one it means that e

162
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
and n when m equals one it means that e
 

163
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,470
and n when m equals one it means that e
equals

164
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
equals
 

165
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,990
equals
n right yeah does it make sense guess

166
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
n right yeah does it make sense guess
 

167
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,190
n right yeah does it make sense guess
okay so when p and m

168
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
okay so when p and m
 

169
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,550
okay so when p and m
when m equals n what is what does it

170
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
when m equals n what is what does it
 

171
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,149
when m equals n what is what does it
equal

172
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159

 

173
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,229

so there are in items i want to see the

174
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
so there are in items i want to see the
 

175
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,589
so there are in items i want to see the
order of everything

176
00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
order of everything
 

177
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,789
order of everything
like three and the other will be six

178
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
like three and the other will be six
 

179
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,869
like three and the other will be six
yeah we talked about this before the for

180
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
yeah we talked about this before the for
 

181
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,869
yeah we talked about this before the for
the first position how many choice

182
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
the first position how many choice
 

183
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,830
the first position how many choice
do we have three okay for the second

184
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
do we have three okay for the second
 

185
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,589
do we have three okay for the second
choice how many two choice how fast

186
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
choice how many two choice how fast
 

187
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,509
choice how many two choice how fast
complaints how many choice do we have

188
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
complaints how many choice do we have
 

189
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,390
complaints how many choice do we have
two and for the third one one so what's

190
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
two and for the third one one so what's
 

191
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,670
two and for the third one one so what's
this

192
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
this
 

193
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,390
this
six yeah i know what's this and

194
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
six yeah i know what's this and
 

195
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,990
six yeah i know what's this and
factorial yes

196
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
factorial yes
 

197
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,950
factorial yes
yeah got it does it make sense three

198
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
yeah got it does it make sense three
 

199
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,390
yeah got it does it make sense three
yeah okay

200
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
yeah okay
 

201
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,749
yeah okay
okay so another case when p and

202
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
okay so another case when p and
 

203
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,270
okay so another case when p and
m when when

204
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
m when when
 

205
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,310
m when when
m bigger than one and smaller than n

206
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
m bigger than one and smaller than n
 

207
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,590
m bigger than one and smaller than n
what does it equal

208
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600

 

209
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,350

okay so let's send if there are three

210
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
okay so let's send if there are three
 

211
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,590
okay so let's send if there are three
elements three apples and i want to pick

212
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
elements three apples and i want to pick
 

213
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,749
elements three apples and i want to pick
two and then permutate it for the first

214
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
two and then permutate it for the first
 

215
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,350
two and then permutate it for the first
position okay three

216
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
position okay three
 

217
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,189
position okay three
for the first position how many how many

218
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
for the first position how many how many
 

219
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,350
for the first position how many how many
do we have how many choice

220
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
do we have how many choice
 

221
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,230
do we have how many choice
three for the second one how many choice

222
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
three for the second one how many choice
 

223
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,469
three for the second one how many choice
okay that's it so what does it equal

224
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
okay that's it so what does it equal
 

225
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,510
okay that's it so what does it equal
six yeah i know it means that equals

226
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
six yeah i know it means that equals
 

227
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,189
six yeah i know it means that equals
n times n minus one times

228
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
n times n minus one times
 

229
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,110
n times n minus one times
n minus two times y and

230
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
n minus two times y and
 

231
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,830
n minus two times y and
minus m plus one okay so it doesn't make

232
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
minus m plus one okay so it doesn't make
 

233
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,749
minus m plus one okay so it doesn't make
sense because when when these end

234
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
sense because when when these end
 

235
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,350
sense because when when these end
one is m equals n then that will be one

236
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
one is m equals n then that will be one
 

237
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,909
one is m equals n then that will be one
right

238
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
right
 

239
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,909
right
yes and then that'll be n factorial do

240
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
yes and then that'll be n factorial do
 

241
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,670
yes and then that'll be n factorial do
you get it yeah

242
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
you get it yeah
 

243
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,029
you get it yeah
so so these these yeah is equals to

244
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
so so these these yeah is equals to
 

245
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,310
so so these these yeah is equals to
n factorial divided by n minus

246
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
n factorial divided by n minus
 

247
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,830
n factorial divided by n minus
n factorial okay okay

248
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
n factorial okay okay
 

249
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,110
n factorial okay okay
okay so this is p so what

250
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
okay so this is p so what
 

251
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,029
okay so this is p so what
what's the com what's this what's the

252
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
what's the com what's this what's the
 

253
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,150
what's the com what's this what's the
relation between p

254
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
relation between p
 

255
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,950
relation between p
and c remember the c does not have order

256
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
and c remember the c does not have order
 

257
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,749
and c remember the c does not have order
combination

258
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
combination
 

259
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,350
combination
but p has order yeah all right

260
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
but p has order yeah all right
 

261
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,710
but p has order yeah all right
so c combination c and m

262
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
so c combination c and m
 

263
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,270
so c combination c and m
equals what equals p and m divided by 1.

264
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
equals what equals p and m divided by 1.
 

265
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,550
equals what equals p and m divided by 1.
can you guess look this is i want

266
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
can you guess look this is i want
 

267
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,110
can you guess look this is i want
this is n is the order but i won't i

268
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
this is n is the order but i won't i
 

269
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,070
this is n is the order but i won't i
don't want the order so divided by 1.

270
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080

 

271
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,629

there are m items this is with order

272
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
there are m items this is with order
 

273
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,710
there are m items this is with order
this is dozen with orders

274
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
this is dozen with orders
 

275
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,150
this is dozen with orders
say divided by

276
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
say divided by
 

277
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,390
say divided by
look there are items and then all the

278
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
look there are items and then all the
 

279
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,230
look there are items and then all the
how many orders how many computational

280
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
how many orders how many computational
 

281
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,350
how many orders how many computational
and

282
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
and
 

283
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,550
and
and sector yeah and this is with

284
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
and sector yeah and this is with
 

285
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,550
and sector yeah and this is with
different orders this is we now so

286
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
different orders this is we now so
 

287
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,749
different orders this is we now so
what you write divided by actually

288
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
what you write divided by actually
 

289
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,590
what you write divided by actually
yeah yeah got it yeah so because this

290
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
yeah yeah got it yeah so because this
 

291
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,790
yeah yeah got it yeah so because this
doesn't have order yeah

292
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
doesn't have order yeah
 

293
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,150
doesn't have order yeah
this this one two three

294
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
this this one two three
 

295
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,870
this this one two three
is and i'll pick 2 you'll be 1 2 right

296
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
is and i'll pick 2 you'll be 1 2 right
 

297
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,670
is and i'll pick 2 you'll be 1 2 right
right

298
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
right
 

299
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,870
right
2 and 1 2 is the same as 2 1 in the c

300
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
2 and 1 2 is the same as 2 1 in the c
 

301
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,790
2 and 1 2 is the same as 2 1 in the c
in a combination but in a p this is

302
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
in a combination but in a p this is
 

303
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,390
in a combination but in a p this is
different order yeah

304
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
different order yeah
 

305
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,870
different order yeah
yeah then you have to divide by two

306
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
yeah then you have to divide by two
 

307
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,469
yeah then you have to divide by two
factorial yeah

308
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
factorial yeah
 

309
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,230
factorial yeah
yeah sorry least so c c

310
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
yeah sorry least so c c
 

311
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,189
yeah sorry least so c c
n m equals least divided by n factorial

312
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
n m equals least divided by n factorial
 

313
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,670
n m equals least divided by n factorial
so it's

314
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
so it's
 

315
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,189
so it's
n factorial divided by n factorial and

316
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
n factorial divided by n factorial and
 

317
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,309
n factorial divided by n factorial and
n minus l factorial all right yes

318
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
n minus l factorial all right yes
 

319
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,990
n minus l factorial all right yes
okay does it make sense yeah okay so

320
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
okay does it make sense yeah okay so
 

321
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,390
okay does it make sense yeah okay so
interesting so so this is the cmp and

322
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
interesting so so this is the cmp and
 

323
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,790
interesting so so this is the cmp and
today we're going to talk about

324
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
today we're going to talk about
 

325
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,150
today we're going to talk about
more importantly this is the c

326
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
more importantly this is the c
 

327
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,430
more importantly this is the c
combination because this is very

328
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
combination because this is very
 

329
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,629
combination because this is very
important right

330
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
important right
 

331
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,070
important right
they are um

332
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080

 

333
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,110

they are four epochs

334
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
they are four epochs
 

335
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,749
they are four epochs
and i want to pick how many ways of

336
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
and i want to pick how many ways of
 

337
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,870
and i want to pick how many ways of
picking two

338
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880

 

339
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,710

so you see yeah combination put two

340
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
so you see yeah combination put two
 

341
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,950
so you see yeah combination put two
apples the order does not match is c

342
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
apples the order does not match is c
 

343
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,230
apples the order does not match is c
for two yeah seven yeah yeah so what

344
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
for two yeah seven yeah yeah so what
 

345
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,309
for two yeah seven yeah yeah so what
does this equal

346
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
does this equal
 

347
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,350
does this equal
so how do we check so look this is

348
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
so how do we check so look this is
 

349
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,070
so how do we check so look this is
n yeah this is m yeah yeah so n

350
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
n yeah this is m yeah yeah so n
 

351
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,909
n yeah this is m yeah yeah so n
factorial divided by

352
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
factorial divided by
 

353
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,110
factorial divided by
n factorial and n minus n factorial

354
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
n factorial and n minus n factorial
 

355
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,150
n factorial and n minus n factorial
n bacteria is four factorial two

356
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
n bacteria is four factorial two
 

357
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,909
n bacteria is four factorial two
factorial

358
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
factorial
 

359
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,629
factorial
and four minus two two factorial so that

360
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
and four minus two two factorial so that
 

361
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,390
and four minus two two factorial so that
was like 4 times 3

362
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
was like 4 times 3
 

363
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,430
was like 4 times 3
times 2 times 1 divided by 2 times 1

364
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
times 2 times 1 divided by 2 times 1
 

365
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,629
times 2 times 1 divided by 2 times 1
divided times 2 times 1 right so 2 2

366
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
divided times 2 times 1 right so 2 2
 

367
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,150
divided times 2 times 1 right so 2 2
1 1 2 2 6.

368
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
1 1 2 2 6.
 

369
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,510
1 1 2 2 6.
yeah got it so there are six ways

370
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
yeah got it so there are six ways
 

371
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,990
yeah got it so there are six ways
yeah doesn't make sense yeah okay so

372
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
yeah doesn't make sense yeah okay so
 

373
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,510
yeah doesn't make sense yeah okay so
so look c and

374
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
so look c and
 

375
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,950
so look c and
m okay so c

376
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
m okay so c
 

377
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,390
m okay so c
n one equals one

378
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
n one equals one
 

379
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,550
n one equals one
how many ways is like an apples i want

380
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
how many ways is like an apples i want
 

381
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,230
how many ways is like an apples i want
to pick one at first how many ways are

382
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
to pick one at first how many ways are
 

383
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,269
to pick one at first how many ways are
there

384
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279

 

385
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,870

n yeah it's the same as permutation

386
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880
n yeah it's the same as permutation
 

387
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,550
n yeah it's the same as permutation
because there's only one right

388
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
because there's only one right
 

389
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,110
because there's only one right
yeah yeah and how about c and n

390
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
yeah yeah and how about c and n
 

391
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,709
yeah yeah and how about c and n
there are unapples i want to pick n

392
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
there are unapples i want to pick n
 

393
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,470
there are unapples i want to pick n
apples how many ways one

394
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
apples how many ways one
 

395
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,910
apples how many ways one
yeah obviously yeah okay so how about

396
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
yeah obviously yeah okay so how about
 

397
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,509
yeah obviously yeah okay so how about
c and m and

398
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519

 

399
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,430

and c n n minus n

400
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
and c n n minus n
 

401
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,590
and c n n minus n
i think at least two what what which one

402
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
i think at least two what what which one
 

403
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,110
i think at least two what what which one
is bigger or they are equal

404
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120

 

405
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,470

are they equal look

406
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
are they equal look
 

407
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,230
are they equal look
i show you there are six apples yeah

408
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
i show you there are six apples yeah
 

409
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,070
i show you there are six apples yeah
there are six apples

410
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080

 

411
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,910

oh it doesn't look like a phone okay i

412
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
oh it doesn't look like a phone okay i
 

413
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,750
oh it doesn't look like a phone okay i
want to pick two it looks

414
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
want to pick two it looks
 

415
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,310
want to pick two it looks
like yeah i want to take two yeah yeah

416
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
like yeah i want to take two yeah yeah
 

417
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,110
like yeah i want to take two yeah yeah
yeah

418
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
yeah
 

419
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,310
yeah
i want to pick two so it's c six two

420
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
i want to pick two so it's c six two
 

421
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,030
i want to pick two so it's c six two
right

422
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
right
 

423
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,990
right
yeah every time i pick two is there a

424
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
yeah every time i pick two is there a
 

425
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,230
yeah every time i pick two is there a
solution for c4

426
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
solution for c4
 

427
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,430
solution for c4
yeah because two plus four equals 6 do

428
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
yeah because two plus four equals 6 do
 

429
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,630
yeah because two plus four equals 6 do
you get it

430
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
you get it
 

431
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,350
you get it
so every time i want to pick 2 i also

432
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
so every time i want to pick 2 i also
 

433
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,710
so every time i want to pick 2 i also
have a solution for

434
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
have a solution for
 

435
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,750
have a solution for
4 right does it make sense

436
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
4 right does it make sense
 

437
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,829
4 right does it make sense
so c and m and c n minus m what is it

438
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
so c and m and c n minus m what is it
 

439
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,710
so c and m and c n minus m what is it
which two are they equal yeah yeah it's

440
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
which two are they equal yeah yeah it's
 

441
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,509
which two are they equal yeah yeah it's
equal yeah

442
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
equal yeah
 

443
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,630
equal yeah
does that make sense yes

444
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
does that make sense yes
 

445
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,269
does that make sense yes
okay yes because look c and c64

446
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
okay yes because look c and c64
 

447
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,350
okay yes because look c and c64
i pick these two like it's the same

448
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
i pick these two like it's the same
 

449
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,430
i pick these two like it's the same
thing as i pick these four right

450
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
thing as i pick these four right
 

451
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,550
thing as i pick these four right
yes all right yeah every time you you

452
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
yes all right yeah every time you you
 

453
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,110
yes all right yeah every time you you
divide

454
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
divide
 

455
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,670
divide
into two and four you got the four

456
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
into two and four you got the four
 

457
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,590
into two and four you got the four
solution which is the same as the two

458
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:11,600
solution which is the same as the two
 

459
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,389
solution which is the same as the two
right

460
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
right
 

461
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,350
right
yeah solutions yeah doesn't make sense

462
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
yeah solutions yeah doesn't make sense
 

463
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,230
yeah solutions yeah doesn't make sense
okay so

464
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
okay so
 

465
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,910
okay so
this is one this is condition and

466
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
this is one this is condition and
 

467
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,870
this is one this is condition and
another another condition is

468
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880

 

469
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,829

c and m so they are n items

470
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
c and m so they are n items
 

471
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,750
c and m so they are n items
they are an item yeah okay there are an

472
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
they are an item yeah okay there are an
 

473
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,389
they are an item yeah okay there are an
item look this is very interesting

474
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
item look this is very interesting
 

475
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,630
item look this is very interesting
there are an item there's seven items

476
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
there are an item there's seven items
 

477
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,630
there are an item there's seven items
yeah yeah they're in items

478
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
yeah yeah they're in items
 

479
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,550
yeah yeah they're in items
and does it mean that i want to

480
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
and does it mean that i want to
 

481
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,710
and does it mean that i want to
if i for the last item just look at the

482
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
if i for the last item just look at the
 

483
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,069
if i for the last item just look at the
last liner

484
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
last liner
 

485
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,550
last liner
and how many possibilities of last last

486
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
and how many possibilities of last last
 

487
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,389
and how many possibilities of last last
item i can pick or not pick

488
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
item i can pick or not pick
 

489
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,910
item i can pick or not pick
right yeah so when i pick it

490
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
right yeah so when i pick it
 

491
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,710
right yeah so when i pick it
so what's it what does it go when i take

492
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
so what's it what does it go when i take
 

493
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,110
so what's it what does it go when i take
it when i pick this item

494
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
it when i pick this item
 

495
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,949
it when i pick this item
yeah so i have n minus one items to pick

496
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
yeah so i have n minus one items to pick
 

497
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,150
yeah so i have n minus one items to pick
yeah from

498
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
yeah from
 

499
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,509
yeah from
oh i have n minus items pick two from

500
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
oh i have n minus items pick two from
 

501
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,910
oh i have n minus items pick two from
n minus item right yeah so i pick these

502
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
n minus item right yeah so i pick these
 

503
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,110
n minus item right yeah so i pick these
i pick this item and

504
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
i pick this item and
 

505
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,630
i pick this item and
how many items i need to pick and minus

506
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
how many items i need to pick and minus
 

507
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,630
how many items i need to pick and minus
one yeah

508
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
one yeah
 

509
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,069
one yeah
and minus one all right yes and

510
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
and minus one all right yes and
 

511
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,269
and minus one all right yes and
that's what by the way c and n c

512
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
that's what by the way c and n c
 

513
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,389
that's what by the way c and n c
and n you can write it as c and m okay

514
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
and n you can write it as c and m okay
 

515
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,590
and n you can write it as c and m okay
so n in a lower and then p

516
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
so n in a lower and then p
 

517
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,710
so n in a lower and then p
p and n is the same thing as p and

518
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
p and n is the same thing as p and
 

519
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,269
p and n is the same thing as p and
m okay so you place the first parameter

520
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
m okay so you place the first parameter
 

521
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,310
m okay so you place the first parameter
and then lower

522
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
and then lower
 

523
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,710
and then lower
at the corner right yeah it's the

524
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
at the corner right yeah it's the
 

525
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,310
at the corner right yeah it's the
notation cmn

526
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
notation cmn
 

527
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,310
notation cmn
so i pick this one so i have

528
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
so i pick this one so i have
 

529
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,910
so i pick this one so i have
i have n minus i one item right yes

530
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
i have n minus i one item right yes
 

531
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,949
i have n minus i one item right yes
and then i need to pick my my minus one

532
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
and then i need to pick my my minus one
 

533
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,350
and then i need to pick my my minus one
right yeah

534
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
right yeah
 

535
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,829
right yeah
okay so and how about if i don't pick

536
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
okay so and how about if i don't pick
 

537
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,110
okay so and how about if i don't pick
this one

538
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
this one
 

539
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,470
this one
if i don't pick this one

540
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480

 

541
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,829

yeah so what does it go

542
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
yeah so what does it go
 

543
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,190
yeah so what does it go
so look

544
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200

 

545
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,190

so it's equals to what

546
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200

 

547
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,790

so look if if i don't pick at least one

548
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
so look if if i don't pick at least one
 

549
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,030
so look if if i don't pick at least one
i

550
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
i
 

551
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,670
i
i have n minus one items right but i

552
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
i have n minus one items right but i
 

553
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,389
i have n minus one items right but i
need to pick

554
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
need to pick
 

555
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,230
need to pick
m m items because i haven't picked

556
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
m m items because i haven't picked
 

557
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,470
m m items because i haven't picked
anything but i decided not to pick the

558
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
anything but i decided not to pick the
 

559
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,750
anything but i decided not to pick the
last one right

560
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
last one right
 

561
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,590
last one right
it doesn't make sense yeah um

562
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
it doesn't make sense yeah um
 

563
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,670
it doesn't make sense yeah um
right look this is very interesting this

564
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
right look this is very interesting this
 

565
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,949
right look this is very interesting this
is the equation

566
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
is the equation
 

567
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,430
is the equation
i want to pick an item from the i want

568
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440
i want to pick an item from the i want
 

569
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,069
i want to pick an item from the i want
to pick m

570
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
to pick m
 

571
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,750
to pick m
items from n right and look at the last

572
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
items from n right and look at the last
 

573
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,230
items from n right and look at the last
item

574
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
item
 

575
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,790
item
if i decide to pick the last item how

576
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
if i decide to pick the last item how
 

577
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,670
if i decide to pick the last item how
many ways

578
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
many ways
 

579
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,310
many ways
how many solutions do i have i have n

580
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
how many solutions do i have i have n
 

581
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,710
how many solutions do i have i have n
minus

582
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
minus
 

583
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,670
minus
one item here and i have n minus one

584
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
one item here and i have n minus one
 

585
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,990
one item here and i have n minus one
because i already pick one here right

586
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
because i already pick one here right
 

587
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,949
because i already pick one here right
and if i decide not to pick this one i

588
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959
and if i decide not to pick this one i
 

589
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:05,269
and if i decide not to pick this one i
have

590
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
have
 

591
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,750
have
n minus one item but i have to pick m

592
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
n minus one item but i have to pick m
 

593
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,590
n minus one item but i have to pick m
item because i haven't picked anything

594
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:09,600
item because i haven't picked anything
 

595
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,509
item because i haven't picked anything
yeah because i decide to skip this one

596
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
yeah because i decide to skip this one
 

597
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,629
yeah because i decide to skip this one
right

598
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
right
 

599
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,110
right
yeah so the total solution is c m m

600
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
yeah so the total solution is c m m
 

601
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,670
yeah so the total solution is c m m
equals c

602
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
equals c
 

603
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,190
equals c
n minus one uh c m minus one m minus one

604
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
n minus one uh c m minus one m minus one
 

605
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,590
n minus one uh c m minus one m minus one
and c

606
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
and c
 

607
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,350
and c
minus one and i'm right let's make sense

608
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
minus one and i'm right let's make sense
 

609
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,590
minus one and i'm right let's make sense
okay so what is it what does

610
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
okay so what is it what does
 

611
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,829
okay so what is it what does
look like i show you remember this one

612
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839
look like i show you remember this one
 

613
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,509
look like i show you remember this one
yeah this one what does

614
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
yeah this one what does
 

615
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,069
yeah this one what does
this what's this

616
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079

 

617
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,470

triangle well done

618
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:44,480

 

619
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,310

okay so look this item equals

620
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
okay so look this item equals
 

621
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,829
okay so look this item equals
this plus this yeah so f is it

622
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
this plus this yeah so f is it
 

623
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,350
this plus this yeah so f is it
equals the sum sum of the shooters yeah

624
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
equals the sum sum of the shooters yeah
 

625
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,550
equals the sum sum of the shooters yeah
yeah so look if this is n

626
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
yeah so look if this is n
 

627
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,230
yeah so look if this is n
rho is n and column is m c

628
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
rho is n and column is m c
 

629
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,590
rho is n and column is m c
and m here right yeah

630
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
and m here right yeah
 

631
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,790
and m here right yeah
equals c n minus 1 and minus 1 is this

632
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
equals c n minus 1 and minus 1 is this
 

633
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,990
equals c n minus 1 and minus 1 is this
item yeah

634
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000
item yeah
 

635
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,030
item yeah
yeah plus c n

636
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
yeah plus c n
 

637
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,150
yeah plus c n
minus 1 m is this item

638
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
minus 1 m is this item
 

639
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,189
minus 1 m is this item
so do you get it this is pascal triangle

640
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
so do you get it this is pascal triangle
 

641
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,629
so do you get it this is pascal triangle
please okay so combination look

642
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
please okay so combination look
 

643
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,069
please okay so combination look
another one five what's this

644
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
another one five what's this
 

645
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,150
another one five what's this
ten ten i want it

646
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
ten ten i want it
 

647
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,269
ten ten i want it
by one yeah okay so this number

648
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
by one yeah okay so this number
 

649
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,509
by one yeah okay so this number
equals four plus six right so look

650
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:37,519
equals four plus six right so look
 

651
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,189
equals four plus six right so look
this is c n minus this is

652
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
this is c n minus this is
 

653
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,389
this is c n minus this is
n right and minus one

654
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
n right and minus one
 

655
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,990
n right and minus one
it's it's not this row yeah yeah right

656
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
it's it's not this row yeah yeah right
 

657
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,350
it's it's not this row yeah yeah right
and m m m

658
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
and m m m
 

659
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,870
and m m m
this item six yeah and minus one this

660
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
this item six yeah and minus one this
 

661
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,430
this item six yeah and minus one this
item

662
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
item
 

663
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,790
item
yeah got it okay so this is pascal

664
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
yeah got it okay so this is pascal
 

665
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,990
yeah got it okay so this is pascal
triangle so

666
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
triangle so
 

667
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,910
triangle so
yeah is it amazing yeah this is the way

668
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
yeah is it amazing yeah this is the way
 

669
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,430
yeah is it amazing yeah this is the way
how we calculate cnn

670
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
how we calculate cnn
 

671
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,790
how we calculate cnn
right okay and we can do it if we we

672
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
right okay and we can do it if we we
 

673
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,430
right okay and we can do it if we we
know this

674
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
know this
 

675
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,870
know this
we can do it recursively okay it will be

676
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
we can do it recursively okay it will be
 

677
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,069
we can do it recursively okay it will be
very easy yeah

678
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
very easy yeah
 

679
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,269
very easy yeah
look define c

680
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:15,279
look define c
 

681
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,710
look define c
and m column yeah yeah

682
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
and m column yeah yeah
 

683
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,990
and m column yeah yeah
let's say if m equal

684
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
let's say if m equal
 

685
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,269
let's say if m equal
one what is the return

686
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
one what is the return
 

687
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,870
one what is the return
an item i want to pick one how many ways

688
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880

 

689
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,389

and yeah we know already yeah

690
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
and yeah we know already yeah
 

691
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:43,690
and yeah we know already yeah
if m equals n return one

692
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:43,700

 

693
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,910

[Music]

694
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
[Music]
 

695
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,269
[Music]
how many ways one one yeah got it

696
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
how many ways one one yeah got it
 

697
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,670
how many ways one one yeah got it
okay then if

698
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
okay then if
 

699
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,110
okay then if
okay so look because look c

700
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
okay so look because look c
 

701
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,629
okay so look because look c
and m equals c and n minus m yeah we

702
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
and m equals c and n minus m yeah we
 

703
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,670
and m equals c and n minus m yeah we
talk about laser when m is zero

704
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
talk about laser when m is zero
 

705
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,069
talk about laser when m is zero
what does it mean c n zero equals c and

706
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
what does it mean c n zero equals c and
 

707
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,590
what does it mean c n zero equals c and
n right so it's one right yes

708
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
n right so it's one right yes
 

709
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,790
n right so it's one right yes
yeah so look if m y n equals one

710
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
yeah so look if m y n equals one
 

711
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,110
yeah so look if m y n equals one
m equals n we can say o

712
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,120
m equals n we can say o
 

713
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,110
m equals n we can say o
or what m equals zero okay

714
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
or what m equals zero okay
 

715
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,030
or what m equals zero okay
column yeah written one yeah otherwise

716
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
column yeah written one yeah otherwise
 

717
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,110
column yeah written one yeah otherwise
return c

718
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
return c
 

719
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,150
return c
n minus one and minus one

720
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
n minus one and minus one
 

721
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,069
n minus one and minus one
plus c n minus 1 what

722
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079

 

723
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,509

what and okay so that's it

724
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
what and okay so that's it
 

725
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,990
what and okay so that's it
that's the way to do it but look look

726
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
that's the way to do it but look look
 

727
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,269
that's the way to do it but look look
because these will be

728
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
because these will be
 

729
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,030
because these will be
expanded and there are lots of

730
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
expanded and there are lots of
 

731
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,990
expanded and there are lots of
calculations we can just do a magic

732
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
calculations we can just do a magic
 

733
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,150
calculations we can just do a magic
just every time we we can use a notebook

734
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
just every time we we can use a notebook
 

735
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,629
just every time we we can use a notebook
yeah remember we can use a notebook here

736
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
yeah remember we can use a notebook here
 

737
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,189
yeah remember we can use a notebook here
yeah and we can check if and m in

738
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
yeah and we can check if and m in
 

739
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,870
yeah and we can check if and m in
notebook when we return the value

740
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
notebook when we return the value
 

741
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,829
notebook when we return the value
and before we can already write it to

742
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
and before we can already write it to
 

743
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:04,630
and before we can already write it to
the notebook but

744
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
the notebook but
 

745
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,470
the notebook but
there's a better way you can do this at

746
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,480
there's a better way you can do this at
 

747
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,069
there's a better way you can do this at
lru cash this is a caching

748
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
lru cash this is a caching
 

749
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,270
lru cash this is a caching
and then let's say next size equals

750
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
and then let's say next size equals
 

751
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,510
and then let's say next size equals
none and in this way the computer will

752
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
none and in this way the computer will
 

753
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,309
none and in this way the computer will
catch the

754
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
catch the
 

755
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,150
catch the
values and then this is the perfect

756
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
values and then this is the perfect
 

757
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,510
values and then this is the perfect
solution to get it

758
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
solution to get it
 

759
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,630
solution to get it
you see look once we have this

760
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
you see look once we have this
 

761
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,789
you see look once we have this
formulation yeah we can translate into

762
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
formulation yeah we can translate into
 

763
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,710
formulation yeah we can translate into
python code easily right it doesn't make

764
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:28,720
python code easily right it doesn't make
 

765
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,669
python code easily right it doesn't make
sense yeah

766
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
sense yeah
 

767
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,750
sense yeah
yeah you see because look we just found

768
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760
yeah you see because look we just found
 

769
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,029
yeah you see because look we just found
out that c n m equals c

770
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
out that c n m equals c
 

771
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,430
out that c n m equals c
n minus one what can you tell me

772
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
n minus one what can you tell me
 

773
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,430
n minus one what can you tell me
okay so can you tell me what's these

774
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440
okay so can you tell me what's these
 

775
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,950
okay so can you tell me what's these
okay

776
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
okay
 

777
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,310
okay
these two can you feel it

778
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
these two can you feel it
 

779
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,470
these two can you feel it
and then look once we have this then we

780
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
and then look once we have this then we
 

781
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,669
and then look once we have this then we
can translate it

782
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
can translate it
 

783
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,150
can translate it
right this is the terminal condition

784
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
right this is the terminal condition
 

785
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,909
right this is the terminal condition
right terminal condition

786
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
right terminal condition
 

787
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,390
right terminal condition
once we have communication we can do it

788
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
once we have communication we can do it
 

789
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,430
once we have communication we can do it
calculate this

790
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
calculate this
 

791
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,270
calculate this
recursively right this is all the

792
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
recursively right this is all the
 

793
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,270
recursively right this is all the
cushion yeah because look the cushion

794
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
cushion yeah because look the cushion
 

795
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,950
cushion yeah because look the cushion
doesn't make sense yeah got it

796
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
doesn't make sense yeah got it
 

797
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,710
doesn't make sense yeah got it
okay so that's it for today

798
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:08,720
okay so that's it for today
 

799
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,830
okay so that's it for today
is it interesting why is it interesting

00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840
is it interesting why is it interesting
 

801
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,390
is it interesting why is it interesting
bye bye okay let's see that's it for

802
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
bye bye okay let's see that's it for

for today we talk about a combination of
 

807
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,430
for today we talk about a combination of
communication and see you tomorrow okay

808
