1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
bye-bye hello Mr Remy said I know right

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,859
no okay you know the time right how will

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,900
you present the time like you know one

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,219
o'clock zero one

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:18,900
twenty right so the format is our and a

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:21,240
minute the hour from zero to to 12. the

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,420
other one is uh 0 to 24 right 24

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,599
actually not including 24. all right

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,960
is zero to twenty three because it

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,360
includes zero yeah yeah and but to the

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,340
12-hour clock doesn't include zero okay

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,380
okay so so yeah

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,680
yeah you're right you're right so look

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,600
sometimes this is if this is the

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,040
afternoon then we probably can represent

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,920
it as 13 20 right or 0 1 20 p.m

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,600
sometimes right okay so today we're

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,700
looking at least 20 24-hour

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,920
representation time representation right

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:02,100
so given the time right 23 56 this is a

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,440
very time right yeah it's Lisa by the

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,820
time uh no why is that

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,520
because you are a 24 yeah 24. okay so

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,460
you know it's

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,000
okay so the hour needs to be bigger than

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,659
zero or equal than zero and 23 yeah okay

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and the meaning needs to be 59 and

28
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,159
bigger than zero right okay so let's say

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,740
we have a string of these terms and but

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,439
if I erase one of it and replace those

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,020
question mark how many valid time can

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,860
you represent using this three one

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,540
dollars uh zero one two zero one two

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,820
okay that's good and how about you

35
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,860
if I replace this with question mark how

36
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,600
many times

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:52,020
how many how many valid terms can you

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,299
represent using this three one zero one

39
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,119
two three no why is it only three and

40
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,720
how about this one look this is zero one

41
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,380
two two right and three three okay and

42
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,579
how about this one zero one zero one two

43
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:11,399
three four five six seven eight nine

44
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,399
okay so how many of loans zero why

45
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,340
it's fun look combination what is it for

46
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,739
eight

47
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,760
eight six twenty six very close how many

48
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,760
possibilities here

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,819
four times ten okay combination do you

50
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,700
get enough yeah

51
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,080
yeah

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,120
we have four Choice here we have 10

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,340
choice so for each choice here we have

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,760
ten so that's four times ten okay make

55
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,840
sense no but it's only zero to nine not

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,840
zero to ten zero to nine

57
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,060
zero yeah look zero to deny how many

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,640
digits how many possibilities ten right

59
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,920
ten and I have four Choice here left

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,560
hand choices here so combination that's

61
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,800
four times ten okay we talk about

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,200
multiplication do okay these these ten

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,000
how many choice

64
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,800
um

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,319
this is very simple look what's how many

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,319
Choice 24 good another one

67
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:22,819
how many shots

68
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:26,400
uh 59 no 60 66

69
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:28,640
but this is quite tricky how about how

70
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
about

71
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,800
two

72
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,540
what you don't need zero or one zero and

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,459
one but not two right okay you've got it

74
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,220
oh yeah well they're nothing that's 29.

75
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:45,120
that's right okay how about that's not

76
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:48,780
that tricky no that's okay good 99

77
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,220
[Music]

78
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,920
how many

79
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:57,060
zero zero yeah because the this is not

80
00:03:52,920 --> 00:04:01,980
the time right uh okay how many uh four

81
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:05,239
here is zero one two three zero one two

82
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,239
three okay yeah what do you mean

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,599
this one

84
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,140
um

85
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,980
ten

86
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,980
ten yeah

87
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,540
that's good so let's go uh so how do we

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,060
solve this problem

89
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,880
we use our brain so we give a string of

90
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,460
this uh

91
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,560
it depends on which digit am I right

92
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,660
yeah so how would you do it what did you

93
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,979
do I mean when we try to find our

94
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,979
Solutions I'm just one

95
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,639
like

96
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,759
keep going this like the time can be

97
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:03,180
because like like I know the time and

98
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,780
and I know like 60 minutes and blah blah

99
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,120
blah blah blah yeah 24 hours blah blah

100
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,440
and I kiss you back

101
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,479
okay like oh let's let's use Let's Do It

102
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,720
um let's do

103
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:22,440
let's let's do like two question mark

104
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,320
column zero zero and they're like I

105
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,360
let's see zero one two three I can't do

106
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,000
four because I know they're 24 hours and

107
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,139
they include in 24 hours clock is

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,660
include zero so we then clicked 24 as a

109
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,660
consequence I don't know okay we first

110
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,000
yes but but here we are not actually in

111
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,240
proof I think we are actually counting

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,940
right we're actually counting so counter

113
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,100
so it's like a pattern matching yeah

114
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:58,800
look so given a time right I I said 13

115
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:01,320
20 something right so if this is

116
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,560
question mark definitely we have 10

117
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,900
digits 10 possibilities right oh yeah if

118
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,580
this is question mark we can't answer

119
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,039
answer at the beginning equals one with

120
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,039
times answer 10. okay

121
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,139
yeah if this is question mark what

122
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,759
happened

123
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:20,759
how many possibilities

124
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,280
six six possibilities okay I'm just

125
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,160
times times six here right so he's 60.

126
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,100
all right yeah if these two are both

127
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,800
question mark how many possibilities

128
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:35,520
if these two the the least the first two

129
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,560
digits yeah if these two uh the first

130
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,080
two digits are question mark it times 24

131
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,300
okay so the typical part is that one of

132
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,160
them is question mark right

133
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,680
one on the next question man and we have

134
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,900
to check the different situation for

135
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,120
example if the first one is question

136
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,900
mark right the first digit is question

137
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,979
mark Len okay so let's add our our mini

138
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,199
mini

139
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:01,560
if the first digit is question mark we

140
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,680
have to check this one all right

141
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,060
so if this digit is

142
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,160
is 0 1 2

143
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:15,120
three so how many possibilities here

144
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,780
three because we can have yellow one two

145
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,539
one two right if it's a four if it's a

146
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,060
four five six to your night how many

147
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:26,099
possibilities two because we only have

148
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,099
zero one right we can't put the two here

149
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:31,620
right yeah that's the first digit how

150
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:34,740
about the second digit if the the second

151
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,139
digit is question mark if the second

152
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,280
digit is question mark so we have to

153
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:43,199
check this first one zero one two okay

154
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,240
we have for the second digits zero one

155
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,860
two three four five six seven eight nine

156
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,599
four zero and one but if it's yeah

157
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,940
zero one two three oh yeah yeah sorry

158
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,979
yeah yeah yeah if it's still on one

159
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,759
that's nine uh that's ten choice right

160
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:58,759
if there's two

161
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:06,240
one two three

162
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:09,060
make sense answer answer equals one and

163
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,060
if we check the last digit if the last

164
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:16,080
digit if last digit is question mark we

165
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,440
answer time equals ten if the second

166
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,860
last digit answer

167
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:27,060
uh times six right if the first two uh

168
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,639
both question mark answer times 24 all

169
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,860
right and then this we have to check the

170
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,959
different situations if the first digit

171
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,360
is still one the second digit could be

172
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:38,820
ten choice if the first digit is two the

173
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,159
second digit have four choice right this

174
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,620
times ten this is times four uh times

175
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:48,060
four and then the opposite if left

176
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,640
second digit is zero one two three the

177
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,680
first digit is three three choice if the

178
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,839
second digit is four five to nine the

179
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,839
first digit have two choice

180
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:03,480
okay another way we know this right yeah

181
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:07,040
we can just prove us for H in range

182
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,380
24 0 to 23. for a minute

183
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,899
in French

184
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,880
60. we prove us the hour a minute and we

185
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:18,480
just have to check if the check if the F

186
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,120
function h m at the time

187
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,339
we just checked it with the matches with

188
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,080
plus equal one and return answer

189
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,600
so let's think here is that how do we

190
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,880
implement this F function

191
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,399
we just have to construct a time using

192
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,920
the H and M right and then we just

193
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,500
compare two string two string this time

194
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,760
is s so we can just return

195
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:44,339
or

196
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:47,100
s i equal equal t i o t i right

197
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:52,980
oti equals question mark

198
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:55,560
for I in range five right because there

199
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,360
are only five five characters zero one

200
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,399
two three four five okay five characters

201
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,480
zero one two three four five five

202
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,600
characters

203
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,700
we have to check if each character

204
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,760
equals or

205
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:12,000
the target time the given time contains

206
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,080
this question mark then it matches look

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,480
I'm complexity what's the time

208
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,080
complexity

209
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,540
um what's the time next day here look

210
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,880
uh Square

211
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,019
what's time obviously 2460 what are

212
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,580
those

213
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,380
oh one constant they are all one

214
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,560
constant term okay and at least so the

215
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,360
first approach is a one constant because

216
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,940
you're just checking we just do this

217
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,060
mesh right okay so what have you learned

218
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,060
to

219
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,360
about the time

220
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,360
on with

221
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
um

222
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,459
yeah

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,320
but the possibilities of the valley yeah

224
00:10:53,459 --> 00:11:00,200
the digi the digi over unknown unknown

225
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:05,040
values difficulties

226
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:08,760
and the approach is that on the left

227
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:15,779
side it's up and we we're seeing that

228
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:21,480
the hours so so if if the hour if if the

229
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:23,399
tens hour is zero one two the second and

230
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,100
the

231
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:29,100
um the first digit

232
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,279
is zero one it can be

233
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:36,180
it can be zero one two oh sorry um

234
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,980
listen the second idiot is this is a big

235
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,060
confusion this is the opposite actually

236
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:45,839
but okay so but if a first digit is zero

237
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:49,920
and one or one and if the second digit

238
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:52,920
is a unknown digit and the first digit

239
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,040
and the first digit is zero and or one

240
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,940
and the unknown digit has 10

241
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:04,079
possibilities and if uh you know if the

242
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:07,019
first digit is two of the unknown the

243
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,760
second digit is zero one can be zero one

244
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,779
two or three

245
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,640
um

246
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:19,800
and and and if and if the first digit is

247
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:23,519
unknown and and so and so

248
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:26,160
it can be if

249
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,680
the second digit if the second digit is

250
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,019
there a one two three it could be zero

251
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,079
one two but if it four five six seven

252
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:37,019
eight nine and it only can be zero and

253
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,600
or one okay and how about I said this

254
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:41,959
the third digit is is

255
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,959
if

256
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,060
is

257
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:52,200
is six no matter what but if both of the

258
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:54,779
minutes are are unknown it can hit 60.

259
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,880
yeah this is six this is ten so sixty

260
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:59,160
right yeah and then the second choice is

261
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,440
to iterate over electron we construct

262
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:05,940
the possible time and check if the time

263
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,220
matches right the given time a time and

264
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,620
a question mark in it okay so what are

265
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,500
we trying to do here we're trying to

266
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,820
count how much possibilities can the

267
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,150
question mark be to

268
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:21,540
be very time yeah so what's the approach

269
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,540
[Music]

270
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,540
um

271
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:33,139
it will be 60 because there's because

272
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,639
the last minute

273
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:43,079
so it's

274
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:47,399
it is the 10 and this and the first

275
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:49,079
minute the the six and six times 60.

276
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,000
okay how about the hours yeah no

277
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,880
possibilities but if one of the minutes

278
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,600
yeah is question mark if it's the second

279
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:01,399
one is only ten okay and if it's the

280
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:06,240
first one's only six yeah if the hours

281
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:08,100
both of them it's 24. that's right but

282
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,399
if

283
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,139
the first one is question mark but the

284
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,560
second one isn't

285
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:19,980
you what you need if the if the second

286
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,639
one is zero to three it could be there's

287
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,560
it could be screamed that the answer is

288
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:29,339
three because they could be free but if

289
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,220
it's fourteen four to nine it only can

290
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:35,160
be zero or one

291
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,620
but if the second one is only it

292
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,519
uh the question what about the first one

293
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,519
isn't

294
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:51,360
It could only be zero two three which is

295
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,519
which is four

296
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,839
but if it's

297
00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:00,839
but if it's one or zero it could it

298
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,139
could only be it could be zero to nine

299
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,760
because it's three because it's free

300
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:10,100
oh you're talking about this right yeah

301
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,100
okay okay that's it for today bye-bye
