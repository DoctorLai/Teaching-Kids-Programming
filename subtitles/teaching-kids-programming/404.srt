1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,600
hello mister missalan all right

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,759
yeah we talked about the exponential

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,760
function and logarithmic yeah

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,920
exponential

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,320
what's exponential function can you give

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,560
me an example in mathematics

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,680
x to the power of 2

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,920
2 to the power of x yeah y to the y

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,279
equals 2 to the power x yeah

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,320
and so look this is the x is x y so if

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,439
we call the numbers here this is 0 0

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,560
1

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,599
two

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,520
three

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,879
four and then accordingly the y axis

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,280
one two three four five

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,120
this is minus one yeah

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,360
minus two and goes the other way is

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,079
minus negative

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,800
okay so 2 to the power of x if we when x

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,520
is 0 2 to the power of 0 is 1 so it's

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,680
here 2 to the power 1 x is 1 2 to the

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,039
power 1 is 2 so

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,359
yeah

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,399
when x is two two to the power of two is

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,080
four yeah so one two three

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,199
one two three four

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,439
uh

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,280
well two to the power one is two so zero

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,119
one two so it's here

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,200
two to the power two

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,159
2 3 4 okay here

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,759
so

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
2 to the power of

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,520
of minus 1 is actually equals 2 to the

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,799
power of 1 1 over 2 to the power 1 right

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,840
so it's

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,880
half

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,280
so when

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,040
x is minus 1 is actually half

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,479
so if you call this function to the

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,479
power x it's like that

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,600
okay exponential okay so we're passing

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,040
this one okay

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,840
this this curve never hits x axis yeah

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,280
it never has x's because 2 to the power

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,759
of x

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
is not never equals to zero right

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,360
excessive

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,680
and the inverse of it we call it

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,399
logarithm

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,240
yeah logarithm

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,320
this logarithm

54
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,320
yeah when we talk about time complexity

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,600
what's the time complexity to solve an

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,600
array which has n elements

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,920
yeah this is where the n

58
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,239
log log coming from right so look look

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,920
the the inverse we are talking about the

60
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,599
inverse of exponential function is

61
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,959
logarithmic so look

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,959
look inverse so what's the inverse

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,959
what's the word inverse yeah the

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,040
opposite yeah the opposite

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,120
so let's put the y equals x function

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,400
which is very obvious it's like that

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,959
yeah

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
yeah so the log element function is like

69
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,280
that so it's the

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,400
opposite look this curve

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,440
mapping here yeah passing the one

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,640
so it'll be something like that

73
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,280
yeah

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,800
and this is the inverse logarithm okay

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,599
so

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,400
to put it simple yeah this way look

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,720
2 to the power x equals y right

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,640
so if we do it like this

79
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,840
log

80
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,840
logo 2 to the power of what

81
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,599
so 2 to the power of x equals 1 okay

82
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,400
look 2 to the power of 3 equals 8 i know

83
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,239
we can say log based on 2 a which is

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,080
equal to 3 because 2 to the power 3

85
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,720
equals 8. yeah look it's just swap yeah

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,920
swap the input and output right

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,159
yeah now we call this inverse function

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,000
so log

89
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,519
log anything

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,840
y equals zero yeah so and x is one right

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,879
so look two

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,080
one

93
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,080
or anything one right a one equals zero

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,080
why is that because a to the power of

95
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,640
any number to the power of zero is what

96
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,720
if a is not equal to zero okay

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,560
so if i say what's the num what's the

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,560
value of three to the power of zero

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,599
what what did i just say

100
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,840
[Music]

101
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,920
any number to the power of zero is

102
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,239
is passing this point yeah

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,879
so any power to the power so what's the

104
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,120
a to a to the power of zero equals one

105
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,000
yeah you see

106
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,599
yeah

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,720
okay this is the opposite yeah do you

108
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,120
get this

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,239
so far so good yeah

110
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,440
okay

111
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,959
look great

112
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,240
okay so

113
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,000
so

114
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,840
this line again never hits y axis right

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,479
this is the same thing because this line

116
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,479
exponential never hits x as it

117
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,040
at least the opposite will never hit the

118
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,280
y axis because look

119
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,560
when when you see when

120
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,120
x is zero so look this is zero yeah

121
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,240
x is never zero because you can have

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,360
nothing

123
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,520
which

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,680
you you will find nothing a to the power

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,479
of not uh you can't find anything that

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,440
to the power of anything equals zero

127
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,720
that's what i'm saying never equals zero

128
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,040
yeah

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,040
okay

130
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,080
okay so today yeah this is the today

131
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,240
we're going to talk about logan function

132
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,160
a little bit more so we want to prove we

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,039
want to put what we want to hit this one

134
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,039
we want to prove

135
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,320
log base a

136
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,320
yeah base a

137
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,880
they say

138
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,199
b times c

139
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,960
equals log a

140
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,840
b plus log a c

141
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,000
okay we want to prove this

142
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,560
log base a

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,639
a to the power what equals b times u

144
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,759
equals log to the power

145
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,280
look a base b not a uh

146
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,560
base ac okay so how can we do this

147
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,639
first of all

148
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,440
we set these

149
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,160
we set x equals not

150
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,680
a to the power of b

151
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,440
a to the b okay i don't know how to

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,919
pronounce this actually

153
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,199
a base b log a b okay y equals log

154
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,639
a c

155
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,440
so we can do this x equals that so it's

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,840
the same as what a to the power of x a

157
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,400
to the power x equals b right

158
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,000
and this one

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,360
a to the power of

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,360
y

161
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:25,039
equals c all right yeah all right so

162
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,840
look b times c here so if we say log

163
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,759
a b times c and we put these together

164
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,639
right we substitute this b and c so it

165
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,600
will be

166
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,560
a

167
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
x

168
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,800
times a y right

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
yeah what's this

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,280
a x

171
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,919
times a y equals a

172
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,960
to the power of x plus y i'm right

173
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,600
but

174
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,880
2 to the power of 3 times 2 to the power

175
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,800
of

176
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,800
four equals two to the power of one

177
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,960
three

178
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,280
there are three twos times together

179
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,000
and then times four two times together

180
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,319
equals two to the power

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,960
many two how many twos

182
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,440
no no no look that's three two look here

183
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,360
three two two times two times two yeah

184
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,759
there are four terms two times two times

185
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
two times two how many twos

186
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,720
times together

187
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,639
sorry

188
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,280
seven yeah it's not times square it's

189
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,160
plus together three plus four right

190
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,720
yeah

191
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,520
so look this one equals log

192
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,120
a a to the power of x plus one so what's

193
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,039
this value come on you can you can give

194
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,919
me the answer log a

195
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,319
a to the power x plus what's this answer

196
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,479
what's this a to the power of what

197
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,960
equals a to the power of x plus y so

198
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,400
what's designed very obvious

199
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:48,080
yeah x plus y easy it right

200
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,319
so look x plus y so a so this bit is x

201
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,240
plus y right yeah

202
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,759
yeah all right

203
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,800
yeah

204
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,560
so look this bit is x plus y right x

205
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
plus one so this bit

206
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
log a

207
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,840
b c

208
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,919
equals x is this one yes because we

209
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
already know is x

210
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,240
a

211
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,120
uh b

212
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,840
plus log a c okay so we just prove it

213
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,120
yeah we just prove it okay i'm gonna

214
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,919
give a

215
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,240
quick question okay

216
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,240
look

217
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,479
come on face

218
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,840
space of

219
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,000
let's say

220
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,199
face lock 10

221
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,159
2

222
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,479
plus

223
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,479
log

224
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,399
10 5

225
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,360
what's this answer

226
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,680
what's this

227
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,959
what's the value of it

228
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,959
come on

229
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,959
what's the value of i give you a hint

230
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,480
what's the value

231
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,360
[Music]

232
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,320
what did i just do i just proved

233
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,519
this equals left right log base

234
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,519
a b times c

235
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,839
and what's the value of this

236
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,560
what's the value of these come on

237
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,600
located

238
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,839
equals log a b plus not ac this is what

239
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,320
a b is not a c so what's the value of

240
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,480
least bit it's hard to calculate these

241
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,959
two yeah but if we

242
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,959
see it together what's the value

243
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,080
look 10 7

244
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,959
70.

245
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,920
how did you get 17

246
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:46,080
what nothing come on come on don't worry

247
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:48,480
look 10 10 2 5 so 2 5 b is 2 c is 5 b

248
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,560
times c

249
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,760
t comply with ten ten a is ten not ten

250
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,760
ten what what's the value

251
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,680
what's the matter sorry a hundred

252
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,360
why is that hundred four

253
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,839
what

254
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,440
10 so what's this value come on you

255
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,360
don't get the speed yeah do you get a

256
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,560
speed

257
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,560
you think do you get a speed

258
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,680
kind of okay so i'm telling you this

259
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,440
this bit is here a b is here this is

260
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,360
here

261
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,000
i know what's what's this

262
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,160
what's b it was c

263
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,440
b equals two

264
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,680
c equals five okay so b times c

265
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,760
what's a

266
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,760
okay so look ten ten equals one

267
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,519
ten to ten to the power of one equals

268
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,399
ten

269
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,800
one

270
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,839
one so it's the answer is one come on

271
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,279
cut it

272
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,399
yeah you have to understand yeah can you

273
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,880
tell me what what's your answer like 120

274
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,880
17

275
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,120
how how did you get the numbers

276
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,600
you you get it

277
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,959
you see look it's hard to calculate this

278
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,720
value right you don't know 10 to the

279
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,320
power of y equals two you don't know

280
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,040
yeah we don't know i need to use the

281
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,920
calculator 10 to the power equals five i

282
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
don't know

283
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,560
you know i need to use the calculator

284
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,279
but all i know is that this one

285
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,120
yeah yeah

286
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,440
all right

287
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,640
i i look ten turn

288
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
log two

289
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,279
log ten two times five equals log ten

290
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,720
two plus log ten

291
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,720
five okay

292
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,800
okay similarly similarly okay we talked

293
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,880
about this similarly if we change this

294
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,680
sign to minus

295
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,480
if we change this term to minus

296
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,000
and now all i have to is to b divided by

297
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,480
c here right

298
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,040
yeah can you imagine we can we can prove

299
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,000
this as well look again we set this to

300
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,959
here

301
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,920
and then b times c b divided by c so it

302
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,160
will be

303
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,160
log

304
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,399
a

305
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,800
a to the power of x divided by a to the

306
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,800
power y right so look

307
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,200
a to the power of x divided by a to the

308
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,160
power y equals a to the power of x minus

309
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,480
y can you get it look 2 to the power of

310
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,279
a divided by 2 to the power of 2 equals

311
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,040
how many 2 left two to the power of a

312
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,040
divided by two to the power two

313
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,720
how many twos left four

314
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
no no no similar mistake then this one

315
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,200
look

316
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,240
imagine they have a twos here

317
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,040
six yeah you see there are a twos

318
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,000
and then you are dividing by two twos

319
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,720
so look turns out how many that

320
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,959
six so it's a minus what a minus two

321
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,560
yeah so a to the power of x divided by a

322
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,519
to the power y equals a to the power of

323
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,600
x minus one right got it

324
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,519
okay so here

325
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,839
so so look this one so equals x minus y

326
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,040
right so if we substitute back we get

327
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,720
this we can get log log a

328
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,839
log a

329
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,399
b c

330
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,600
b divided by c equals log a

331
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,639
b minus block ac okay okay similar okay

332
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,600
i'm going to give a question now okay

333
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,440
lock

334
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,680
face base

335
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
10

336
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,880
15

337
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,880
minus block 10

338
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:26,720
okay okay maybe maybe look 30 minus not

339
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
10 20 equals

340
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,760
log3 okay lastly

341
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,600
