1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,400
okay so we talked about the eight

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,679
experience of the club yeah

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,679
what's graph hey what's going on

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,679
um

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,880
[Music]

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,040
what's a cyclic means doesn't go all

7
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:39,360
around it doesn't have sights

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,360
can you give me an example of the dag

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,440
remember what kind of things

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,559
we have used before we have learned

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,360
before which is the daisy come on it's a

12
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,079
three three where down three is the bag

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,920
why because why is that gonna look blue

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,160
one two

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,480
three four yeah

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,000
it doesn't have errors but by default

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,559
you know the parents

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,239
you can travel from parents to the kids

19
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,400
yeah that's an error something can that

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,720
be an exercise

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,439
yeah look a cyclist doesn't have a graph

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,520
doesn't have science

23
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,200
from parents or kids yeah but how would

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,159
they get up again

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,799
good point we don't usually

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,560
remember remember the three notes we

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,520
define as this

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,520
so you know yeah

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,880
okay

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,720
value left yeah and then right

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,600
yeah this is the value for the note and

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,280
left points to the point left left left

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
note and right points the right note

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,399
look what does this mean eric

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,280
look the parent this parent can point to

36
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,920
left and right and for kids it doesn't

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,680
usually know what which parent right

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,360
but there's a way you can keep tracking

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,320
of this you know where it comes from

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:07,560
using this level search yeah by passing

41
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,560
down the current value okay

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,520
easy okay so

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,959
what have we talked about yesterday we

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,920
talked about this

45
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,360
yeah from zero look one

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,879
two

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,480
three

48
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,200
and then

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,319
here is this a tsg

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,319
is this a dag

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,200
come on is this a cycle

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,319
is this a cycle

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,280
look at

54
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,280
look at the arrows is this the cycle

55
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,360
[Music]

56
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,120
is this the side no come on you go least

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,560
but you cannot go back right so this is

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,720
this is a dad right directly a cyclist

59
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,400
aircraft it doesn't have cycling

60
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,599
look at the error yeah zero can go to

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,680
two but two can not go back to zero okay

62
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,560
so can you find the path between all the

63
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,760
parts between zeros and three

64
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,760
and zero one two three

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,680
so what have we used yesterday to to

66
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,120
implement these the agreement

67
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,120
yeah we talked about the differences

68
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,320
today we're talking about

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,550
culture yeah

70
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,550
[Music]

71
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,760
[Music]

72
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,560
which you can

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,200
have you can have a pop pop

74
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,159
the both sides pop left poke

75
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,640
a plant left a pen okay so it's a cue

76
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,560
you can do operation perform operation

77
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,480
push and pop operation on the both sides

78
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,519
of the queue okay let's speak to you

79
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,760
uh can you can you tell me what's the dq

80
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,760
uh

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
uh what's the

82
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,840
what does the other ones need okay

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,159
what's the breakfast session

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,120
breakfast searching one two three five

85
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,120
six four seven

86
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,560
okay so let's implement this

87
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,560
okay it's right

88
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,080
first of all we need to find out the end

89
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,040
n is length of the graph okay graph is

90
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,680
defined as the adjacent link

91
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,520
list okay adjacent increase

92
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,400
minus one adjacent

93
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,080
that we we are finding the source

94
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,479
we are finding all the paths between

95
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,880
zero to n uh to m

96
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,360
and minus one okay so actually yeah

97
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,840
let's just do this to n minus one

98
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,960
so adjacent adjacent

99
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,960
adjacent increase

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,280
so g is adjacent into this what does

101
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,600
mean the the first element g zero

102
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,160
z zero what's d zero i mean

103
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,199
it mean look alright so what adjacent is

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,560
okay zero to one let's come let's let's

105
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,039
do this again okay uh two three

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,759
what adjacent is how do we represent

107
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,800
these adjacent needs of this graph d

108
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,240
allow

109
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,240
where is zero connected to

110
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,320
one two one and two okay and what's g g

111
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,400
one look g one what's what's one

112
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
connected to

113
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,400
one

114
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,759
sorry one is connected to one two two

115
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,400
let's see

116
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,360
what's g two are connected to

117
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,960
three yeah and then hey guys

118
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,440
and g3

119
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,320
area on two two three

120
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,680
ah

121
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,759
sorry there isn't a pointy thing yeah

122
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,639
yeah okay three points to nothing so

123
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,560
it's empty okay so look so see this is

124
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,720
adjacent is g okay

125
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,600
yeah you see the key

126
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,919
0 1 2 is the node and then it points to

127
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,720
a list which is has the nodes like it

128
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,680
connects to it yes this is

129
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,240
directions okay

130
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,199
so g and then in order to implement the

131
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,319
as we said uh we use the dq yeah let's

132
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,440
keep q equals dq

133
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,080
so what what parameters do we need to

134
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,840
we need to we stop we need to store the

135
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,759
number of the

136
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,360
the path the current path and we also

137
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,560
need to store the

138
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,000
to store the current node okay so at the

139
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,960
beginning

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,039
what do we what do we put in in it

141
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,960
what do we put in the area what's the

142
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,960
current now what we put in the tuber

143
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,479
yeah cuba remember the tuber what the

144
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,039
the tuber is the

145
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,639
contains the list of elements

146
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,120
yeah what's the difference between this

147
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,120
uh least

148
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,439
[Music]

149
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,960
what's the current

150
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,960
what's the first element to put where is

151
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,240
where do we start searching the path

152
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,280
from

153
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,759
um

154
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,280
from the beginning zero right and then

155
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,400
what's the path

156
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,479
n minus one no no no path will be at the

157
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,039
beginning will be zero right so it's a

158
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,280
list of uh this this is the current path

159
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,759
this is the source

160
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,120
so the tube tuber will be current

161
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,599
node okay and then the pass

162
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,520
plus okay so we we we just use the path

163
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,440
path is a list of the

164
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,919
a list of

165
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
nodes with integer and then this is the

166
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,800
integer okay

167
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,280
this has been

168
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,240
q okay

169
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,039
so

170
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,680
we put we have the initial note uh

171
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,919
so what do we do next we we need to have

172
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,080
the answer answer variable to store all

173
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,440
the elements all the paths right and

174
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,759
then

175
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,759
why why what

176
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,120
remember we talked about this breakfast

177
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,120
we need to find out if they are you know

178
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,879
what is the meaning of y cube well

179
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
there's an element

180
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,759
why is there something in the queue okay

181
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,560
and then we need to take the elements in

182
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,240
the front of key which is the current

183
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,919
node

184
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,080
and then that's a two player so we can

185
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,599
use the comma what's that what's this

186
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,360
path yeah

187
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,400
path

188
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,400
equals q y we want to take the

189
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,710
yes we want to take what's the

190
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,959
difference between pop and poplar

191
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:38,240
[Music]

192
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,320
poplar which direction we pop there okay

193
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,560
so we have a key

194
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,519
okay look one two three pop left what

195
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,320
happened

196
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,959
one is gone one is gone okay even

197
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,959
pop what happened

198
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,640
three is gone

199
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,360
yeah you see there's no top right okay

200
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,959
it's pop left and pop okay

201
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,279
yeah

202
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,160
because at least by default when you do

203
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,240
a pop from a list is from the right hand

204
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,839
side why

205
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,120
just by default the list the list here

206
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,320
is the list yeah it's a the list is like

207
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
a stack yeah

208
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,320
uh one two three

209
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,720
so look what is remaining then why can't

210
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,800
you turn the other side good point by

211
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,480
default this is one two three the list

212
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,480
is actually like that okay

213
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,479
[Music]

214
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,760
if you want to do this you can do this

215
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,839
if you want to take this take the first

216
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,000
element out of the list

217
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,040
remember we can still use pop but we

218
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,399
have to put we have to give a parameter

219
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,440
what we want to take this out pop it

220
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,470
whatever

221
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,800
hey

222
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,680
[Music]

223
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,279
no no you take this off pop one

224
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,519
remember there's a value i put here

225
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,680
yellow where then pops here okay if you

226
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,720
don't put the parameter you'll take the

227
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,720
last element okay

228
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,120
no no no left top left is only applied

229
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,399
to the heel but at least doesn't have a

230
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,160
problem okay yeah

231
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,839
different objects

232
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,200
different logic do you understand yeah

233
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,920
like uh

234
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,360
you can ride a horse the horse

235
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
the horse

236
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,920
horse has a right yeah

237
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,079
right master right

238
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,000
but a car doesn't have a right car we

239
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,920
have another method called drive you see

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,959
this is object oriented different

241
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,440
options have different methods

242
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,560
no no this is unless i talk about this

243
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,480
list

244
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,240
and dq there are different objects

245
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,920
that's why they have different they are

246
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,720
similar but they have different kinds of

247
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,200
methods okay it's like horse you can

248
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,760
only ride a horse and you can only drive

249
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,959
a car you cannot you can go you can walk

250
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,680
a horse yeah you cannot drive a horse

251
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,920
and you cannot ride the car okay okay so

252
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,440
okay coming back to this subject

253
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,440
coming back to the subject we've got the

254
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,560
current now we've got a path and then we

255
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,480
need to check if current node equals one

256
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,880
if current now equals the target which

257
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,680
is target

258
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,600
n

259
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,040
n minus one okay zero from the n minus

260
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,760
sign

261
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,040
okay minus one then we answer dot append

262
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,000
what we need to put this current what

263
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,839
come on

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,480
what's the part what's the answer answer

265
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,190
is the thought that mr pass and what

266
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,360
what's the

267
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,839
[Music]

268
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,520
what what what what's your opinion

269
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,580
what's your opinion

270
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,580
[Music]

271
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,560
and then

272
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,560
and then what happened

273
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,279
if we we do this and what should we do

274
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,839
what should we do what should we do what

275
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,839
should we do next

276
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,040
what should we do next

277
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,200
[Music]

278
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,480
which kind of note what's the word and

279
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,040
not what are the next note for next note

280
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,040
yeah next

281
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,560
[Music]

282
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,880
yeah we know this already

283
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,920
i know what should we do next

284
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
we should

285
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,160
we should

286
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,240
we should

287
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,880
we find the next note so we have we know

288
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,880
where it goes to next so we want to

289
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,040
build a path right

290
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,440
so

291
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,639
can you tell me what's right

292
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,600
what happened q q yeah we append into

293
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,200
the list in into a queue append

294
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,399
app and that's a keyword and the first

295
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,160
node is the next node which is what next

296
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,399
now

297
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:54,800
and the path will be updated into what

298
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:58,079
past plus plus a next note right we want

299
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,959
to give a next note this is the new path

300
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,200
right

301
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,519
correct

302
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
yeah

303
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,480
and there's one thing missing

304
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,120
whatever

305
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,880
two things

306
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,680
so it's least simpler than the different

307
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,120
search remember which one is simpler

308
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,000
the difference search you will implement

309
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,240
a concussion uh uh

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,040
remember we we need to

311
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,279
we we need to push and pop the

312
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,440
path right but for now we don't need uh

313
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,760
in the breakfast search we we just

314
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,680
update the path yeah we just push the

315
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,760
new path into the queue that's why we

316
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,639
don't need to push and pop

317
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,040
right

318
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,519
in the default search we need to push

319
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,760
push pushing a new node into the current

320
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,000
pass and now we call recursion we call

321
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,959
the current pass i call it a default

322
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,120
search

323
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,720
after we finish the default search we

324
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,880
need to pop

325
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,040
the note from the current pass to

326
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,360
restore it yeah to restore the state

327
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,760
where it was but for this one the

328
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,920
preference search will just update uh we

329
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,480
just push the note yeah the note and we

330
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,600
take it out from the queue and here

331
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,639
and we expand the next note which is uh

332
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,880
the next edges yeah and here is

333
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,880
anyone until we find the destination

334
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,560
which is n minus one what's the time

335
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,880
complexity this this is a bit tricky

336
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,600
because in the worst cases in the worst

337
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,240
cases what it's a directed

338
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,399
a cyclic link a cyclic one right so what

339
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,760
does it mean if you look it's yellow if

340
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,560
there are let's say that you fill our

341
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,040
finals okay cl can go to one two three

342
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,839
four yeah one two three four

343
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,320
okay

344
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,560
yeah one can go to one

345
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,199
one can go to

346
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,519
two three four okay

347
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,120
let's do this square

348
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,120
two three four

349
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,199
and two can go to one

350
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,760
three four

351
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,839
so you can go to four yeah so a

352
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,320
every node can go to the nodes which

353
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,959
have a larger value

354
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,440
to satisfy directly uncycling link yeah

355
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,000
so these how many know how many edges

356
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,639
one two three four five six seven eight

357
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,360
nine ten ten edges

358
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,839
there are five notes ten edges

359
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,680
yeah each one has two uh no look zero

360
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,720
zero one two four

361
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,600
plus

362
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,320
uh one two three seven so it's four plus

363
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,320
seven plus two plus one

364
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,360
yeah plus one

365
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,759
okay so let's turn 10 pages so they are

366
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,839
n when n is

367
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,079
when n is what and when n is five

368
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,279
is ten edges

369
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,199
so one n is six is what fifteen edges

370
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,199
right

371
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,360
is it right

372
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,320
we can totally we can do this again

373
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,120
maybe

374
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,560
uh

375
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,240
maybe two of

376
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,210
six

377
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,279
zero to

378
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,120
[Music]

379
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,399
let's write it in a tree okay zero one

380
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,399
two three four five

381
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,800
okay one could be one two three four

382
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,839
yeah

383
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,639
two three four five

384
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,320
yeah

385
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,839
okay so it's actually more than that

386
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,399
right look

387
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,320
okay so actually that this is not

388
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,639
entirely correct let's let's try this

389
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
again just four four edges zero can go

390
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,199
to

391
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,040
zero can go to one two three

392
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,240
one can go to two

393
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,639
three

394
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,959
two can go to three

395
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,079
yeah two can go to one two can go to

396
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,920
three

397
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,079
okay

398
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,560
so each node can go to the nodes that

399
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,920
have a larger value so by series by

400
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,399
series okay

401
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,959
uh by series it has the if i don't know

402
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,079
they will be have two

403
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,440
uh

404
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,639
two

405
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,839
n minus one okay roughly okay let's say

406
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,399
if it is the same at least n is four

407
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,160
four minus one is three two to the power

408
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,279
of three is eight one two three four

409
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,399
five six eight okay six seven seven okay

410
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,279
lovely

411
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,000
so let's the number of edges

412
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,319
and to build each one roughly it needs

413
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,720
the n right or n time

414
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,720
o n time so the compound connection is o

415
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,520
n times two to the power of n minus one

416
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,600
uh

417
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,000
is

418
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,880
10 it

419
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,439
the power of n minus 1 uh 2 to the power

420
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,240
n all right because 2 minus 1 times 2

421
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,480
okay

422
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,400
2 to the power n

423
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,880
2 to the power of n

424
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,440
minus 5 4

425
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,760
okay so the space complexity is is the

426
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,160
same as the time capacity because we

427
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,520
need and in worse cases you will need

428
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,360
you will need a

429
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,760
answer to store all the paths you have

430
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,360
to install the path

431
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,360
okay

432
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,840
any questions so far any questions

433
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,730
any questions so far

434
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
any questions

435
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,880
[Music]

436
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,240
yeah

437
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,120
um

438
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,120
okay i'm going to erase

439
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,799
okay i'm going to erase what

440
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,919
here

441
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,240
yeah this bit

442
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,280
this is the top bit

443
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,919
and then

444
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,160
and the next next okay two two things

445
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,160
here

446
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,080
can somebody help me

447
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,160
so you tell me what to do here

448
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,240
what do we know

449
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,240
what what do we want to do

450
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,160
so

451
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,360
karina so what what color now and

452
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,400
password

453
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,400
this is

454
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
equal as well

455
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
yeah so like because they're cute each

456
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,080
one you pop two elements kill the

457
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,400
problem right now

458
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,080
the first thing of best research is to

459
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,360
pop it from the front of the cube okay

460
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,559
and then here

461
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,559
we don't want to be aware

462
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,150
next night

463
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,150
[Music]

464
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,039
yeah plus plus

465
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,000
square okay

466
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,280
at least plus another is there next note

467
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
why we need a bracket here look if this

468
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,360
is this one two three

469
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,360
yeah we want to add another four to it

470
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,840
okay ryan this is a list

471
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,840
we want to add

472
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,600
it edit

473
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,120
so we can do this a plus one

474
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,880
a plus one

475
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,840
drag key four

476
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,240
okay okay look

477
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,160
this makes sense this is this everywhere

478
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,679
look

479
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,760
i want to add another element to it yeah

480
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,000
okay

481
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,400
oh you can look normally we can do this

482
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,400
a dot a pen right but 8.10 doesn't

483
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,799
return anything

484
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,280
yeah it often doesn't return anything

485
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,679
instead you will push the four into this

486
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,440
you'll change the value of a another way

487
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,400
is to add a

488
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,000
there's another keyword called extend

489
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,799
okay it's ten

490
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,720
and then you can give another list

491
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,120
okay four or five

492
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,039
something like that then you will become

493
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,600
okay can you tell me what what's next

494
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,410
it's ten four five what does it become

495
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,479
what's the a become

496
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,479
[Music]

497
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,400
yeah

498
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
you can count

499
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,799
concatenate

500
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,120
to list one two three four five and now

501
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,280
become one of the things we'll find

502
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,640
okay

503
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,880
okay that's it for today good job bye

504
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,880
bye bye
