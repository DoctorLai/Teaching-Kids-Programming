00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,309

hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today
 

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,190
hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today
good good okay so today we talk about uh

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
good good okay so today we talk about uh
 

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,509
good good okay so today we talk about uh
permutation

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
permutation
 

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,509
permutation
per new patient cheers

8
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
per new patient cheers
 

9
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,829
per new patient cheers
do you we talked about this before yeah

10
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:15,839
do you we talked about this before yeah
 

11
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,189
do you we talked about this before yeah
commutation always permutation

12
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
commutation always permutation
 

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,750
commutation always permutation
it's like look at the exclusive numbers

14
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
it's like look at the exclusive numbers
 

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,790
it's like look at the exclusive numbers
yeah it's just a different way to with

16
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
yeah it's just a different way to with
 

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,589
yeah it's just a different way to with
the

18
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
the
 

19
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,870
the
you're given a list of the elements and

20
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
you're given a list of the elements and
 

21
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,110
you're given a list of the elements and
permutation is that the number of

22
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
permutation is that the number of
 

23
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,389
permutation is that the number of
possible

24
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:34,399
possible
 

25
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,030
possible
different orders yeah so look one two

26
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
different orders yeah so look one two
 

27
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,950
different orders yeah so look one two
three we're given at least one two three

28
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
three we're given at least one two three
 

29
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,950
three we're given at least one two three
and then the six ways

30
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
and then the six ways
 

31
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,910
and then the six ways
whoa yeah three times two times one six

32
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
whoa yeah three times two times one six
 

33
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,709
whoa yeah three times two times one six
ways so look

34
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
ways so look
 

35
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,029
ways so look
two three one is one of the permutation

36
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
two three one is one of the permutation
 

37
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,830
two three one is one of the permutation
yeah

38
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
yeah
 

39
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,830
yeah
yeah all right so if you want to write

40
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:49,840
yeah all right so if you want to write
 

41
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,670
yeah all right so if you want to write
this four permutation how many

42
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:51,680
this four permutation how many
 

43
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,950
this four permutation how many
one two three one three two

44
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
one two three one three two
 

45
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,630
one two three one three two
two one three two three one three one

46
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
two one three two three one three one
 

47
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,830
two one three two three one three one
two and one three two one we are done

48
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
two and one three two one we are done
 

49
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,830
two and one three two one we are done
okay so basically this one has three

50
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
okay so basically this one has three
 

51
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,830
okay so basically this one has three
possibilities the second place

52
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
possibilities the second place
 

53
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,630
possibilities the second place
has two problems and the third one one

54
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
has two problems and the third one one
 

55
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,590
has two problems and the third one one
possibility

56
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
possibility
 

57
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,750
possibility
so that's uh how many if there are n

58
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
so that's uh how many if there are n
 

59
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,789
so that's uh how many if there are n
elements how many possibilities

60
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
elements how many possibilities
 

61
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,350
elements how many possibilities
we talk about n factorial where there

62
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
we talk about n factorial where there
 

63
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,510
we talk about n factorial where there
are n factorial yes because this is

64
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
are n factorial yes because this is
 

65
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,630
are n factorial yes because this is
n times n minus one times n

66
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
n times n minus one times n
 

67
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,910
n times n minus one times n
minus two times tier one right this is

68
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
minus two times tier one right this is
 

69
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,550
minus two times tier one right this is
exactly

70
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
exactly
 

71
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,910
exactly
n factorial all right yes okay so today

72
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:29,920
n factorial all right yes okay so today
 

73
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,630
n factorial all right yes okay so today
the task

74
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
the task
 

75
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,789
the task
is to given uh a list of

76
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
is to given uh a list of
 

77
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,069
is to given uh a list of
unique elements okay you can say it's

78
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
unique elements okay you can say it's
 

79
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,710
unique elements okay you can say it's
unique it doesn't contain duplicates

80
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
unique it doesn't contain duplicates
 

81
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,950
unique it doesn't contain duplicates
and then you need to generate all these

82
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
and then you need to generate all these
 

83
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,190
and then you need to generate all these
possibilities

84
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
possibilities
 

85
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,510
possibilities
interesting any ideas how are we doing

86
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
interesting any ideas how are we doing
 

87
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,109
interesting any ideas how are we doing
this

88
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
this
 

89
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,789
this
how we're doing look let's do this three

90
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
how we're doing look let's do this three
 

91
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,429
how we're doing look let's do this three
uh one two three for example how can we

92
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
uh one two three for example how can we
 

93
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,870
uh one two three for example how can we
generate this

94
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
generate this
 

95
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,510
generate this
you check how many numbers are in the

96
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
you check how many numbers are in the
 

97
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,550
you check how many numbers are in the
list

98
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
list
 

99
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,950
list
yeah i know i already this is nums okay

100
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
yeah i know i already this is nums okay
 

101
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,429
yeah i know i already this is nums okay
let's say this is nums

102
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
let's say this is nums
 

103
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,430
let's say this is nums
okay okay so now how can we generate

104
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
okay okay so now how can we generate
 

105
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,309
okay okay so now how can we generate
these four

106
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
these four
 

107
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,390
these four
permutations any any idea how we

108
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
permutations any any idea how we
 

109
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,949
permutations any any idea how we
doing this

110
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
doing this
 

111
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,229
doing this
any idea what brian no

112
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
any idea what brian no
 

113
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,670
any idea what brian no
yes yes working yes that's very good

114
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
yes yes working yes that's very good
 

115
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,910
yes yes working yes that's very good
how can we swap and how about look look

116
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
how can we swap and how about look look
 

117
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,390
how can we swap and how about look look
look let's say we are here yeah we swap

118
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
look let's say we are here yeah we swap
 

119
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,509
look let's say we are here yeah we swap
we swap with with the hourly elements on

120
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
we swap with with the hourly elements on
 

121
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:41,910
we swap with with the hourly elements on
the

122
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
the
 

123
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,150
the
on or on the right or hand side so we

124
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
on or on the right or hand side so we
 

125
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,150
on or on the right or hand side so we
saw one with one so it doesn't change

126
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
saw one with one so it doesn't change
 

127
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,990
saw one with one so it doesn't change
we swap look we swap we swap one

128
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
we swap look we swap we swap one
 

129
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,509
we swap look we swap we swap one
and one okay one and three and then

130
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
and one okay one and three and then
 

131
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,949
and one okay one and three and then
one and two so that comes to one three

132
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
one and two so that comes to one three
 

133
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,550
one and two so that comes to one three
and then slope one and three that would

134
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
and then slope one and three that would
 

135
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,470
and then slope one and three that would
be three two

136
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
be three two
 

137
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,630
be three two
one right yes all right

138
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
one right yes all right
 

139
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,470
one right yes all right
that's like when you're here you swap it

140
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
that's like when you're here you swap it
 

141
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,509
that's like when you're here you swap it
with anything

142
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519

 

143
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,630

on or on the right hand side okay

144
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
on or on the right hand side okay
 

145
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,430
on or on the right hand side okay
and then you go to the next one so when

146
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
and then you go to the next one so when
 

147
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,589
and then you go to the next one so when
you go to the next one so let's look

148
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
you go to the next one so let's look
 

149
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,910
you go to the next one so let's look
two you're going to the next one right

150
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
two you're going to the next one right
 

151
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,670
two you're going to the next one right
and then you again you swap

152
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
and then you again you swap
 

153
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,670
and then you again you swap
with one and three so that will be

154
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
with one and three so that will be
 

155
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,509
with one and three so that will be
another one two three one

156
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
another one two three one
 

157
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,910
another one two three one
and then again you swap two and one i

158
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
and then again you swap two and one i
 

159
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,789
and then again you swap two and one i
know b and

160
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
know b and
 

161
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,830
know b and
three one two right here

162
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
three one two right here
 

163
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,949
three one two right here
and then look sorry how about one three

164
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
and then look sorry how about one three
 

165
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:35,350
and then look sorry how about one three
two

166
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
two
 

167
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,070
two
yeah yeah okay so look three one swap

168
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
yeah yeah okay so look three one swap
 

169
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,869
yeah yeah okay so look three one swap
will use one

170
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
will use one
 

171
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,110
will use one
and then go to the next one and then

172
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
and then go to the next one and then
 

173
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,630
and then go to the next one and then
swap

174
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
swap
 

175
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,990
swap
sub three with two so that's one three

176
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
sub three with two so that's one three
 

177
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,789
sub three with two so that's one three
got it so this way you can generate all

178
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
got it so this way you can generate all
 

179
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,270
got it so this way you can generate all
the

180
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
the
 

181
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,110
the
permutation okay they say make sense

182
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
permutation okay they say make sense
 

183
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,509
permutation okay they say make sense
look

184
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
look
 

185
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,990
look
i give you one i explain one more time

186
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
i give you one i explain one more time
 

187
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,190
i give you one i explain one more time
okay so this is

188
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
okay so this is
 

189
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,390
okay so this is
like that okay one two

190
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
like that okay one two
 

191
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,149
like that okay one two
three okay so now i'm at this position

192
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
three okay so now i'm at this position
 

193
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,149
three okay so now i'm at this position
all right i can i want to swap

194
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
all right i can i want to swap
 

195
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,229
all right i can i want to swap
one to one then that's the one

196
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
one to one then that's the one
 

197
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,830
one to one then that's the one
possibility one and one

198
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
possibility one and one
 

199
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,750
possibility one and one
and then i move it to the next then the

200
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
and then i move it to the next then the
 

201
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,150
and then i move it to the next then the
next position will be

202
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
next position will be
 

203
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,509
next position will be
next permutation will be from here right

204
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
next permutation will be from here right
 

205
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,230
next permutation will be from here right
maybe yeah maybe i know i know how to do

206
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
maybe yeah maybe i know i know how to do
 

207
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,870
maybe yeah maybe i know i know how to do
it

208
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880

 

209
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,070

so now the first

210
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
so now the first
 

211
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,950
so now the first
first one would be one right and then

212
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960
first one would be one right and then
 

213
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,030
first one would be one right and then
the second one would be two

214
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
the second one would be two
 

215
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,990
the second one would be two
the third one would be three one two

216
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
the third one would be three one two
 

217
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,469
the third one would be three one two
three

218
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
three
 

219
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,430
three
okay so when you swap one first one with

220
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
okay so when you swap one first one with
 

221
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,870
okay so when you swap one first one with
one

222
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
one
 

223
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,510
one
it's here right when you spur with one

224
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
it's here right when you spur with one
 

225
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,150
it's here right when you spur with one
and two

226
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
and two
 

227
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,430
and two
it's here right when you sleep swap

228
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
it's here right when you sleep swap
 

229
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,590
it's here right when you sleep swap
three with one it's real the first one

230
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
three with one it's real the first one
 

231
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,390
three with one it's real the first one
yeah and then you go down go next

232
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
yeah and then you go down go next
 

233
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,270
yeah and then you go down go next
you go next then you'll be and when you

234
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
you go next then you'll be and when you
 

235
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,550
you go next then you'll be and when you
swap one with one

236
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
swap one with one
 

237
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,629
swap one with one
the first one is determined is one and

238
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
the first one is determined is one and
 

239
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,029
the first one is determined is one and
then you have two three right

240
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
then you have two three right
 

241
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,430
then you have two three right
all right you need to permutate two

242
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
all right you need to permutate two
 

243
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,550
all right you need to permutate two
three

244
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
three
 

245
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,590
three
two so look you swap two

246
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
two so look you swap two
 

247
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,310
two so look you swap two
with two then the second one is two you

248
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
with two then the second one is two you
 

249
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,629
with two then the second one is two you
swap two with three the second one is

250
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
swap two with three the second one is
 

251
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,029
swap two with three the second one is
three

252
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
three
 

253
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,790
three
right very good yeah when you swap two

254
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
right very good yeah when you swap two
 

255
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,430
right very good yeah when you swap two
is two

256
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
is two
 

257
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,749
is two
then obviously you you can only have

258
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
then obviously you you can only have
 

259
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,710
then obviously you you can only have
three a lot

260
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
three a lot
 

261
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,790
three a lot
because three you move to the next when

262
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
because three you move to the next when
 

263
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,310
because three you move to the next when
you swap three with two

264
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
you swap three with two
 

265
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,990
you swap three with two
and then here is two round right you

266
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
and then here is two round right you
 

267
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,230
and then here is two round right you
move it to the next so it's two

268
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
move it to the next so it's two
 

269
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,430
move it to the next so it's two
okay got it okay how about this

270
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
okay got it okay how about this
 

271
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,550
okay got it okay how about this
you you one swoop with two

272
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
you you one swoop with two
 

273
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,590
you you one swoop with two
right then you become two one three and

274
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
right then you become two one three and
 

275
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,029
right then you become two one three and
then now you move it to here

276
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
then now you move it to here
 

277
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,990
then now you move it to here
right again you can swap one with one so

278
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
right again you can swap one with one so
 

279
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,110
right again you can swap one with one so
it doesn't change

280
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
it doesn't change
 

281
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,909
it doesn't change
yeah right you swap with three then

282
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
yeah right you swap with three then
 

283
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,990
yeah right you swap with three then
you become three and one is one

284
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
you become three and one is one
 

285
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,270
you become three and one is one
obviously you'll be three here and then

286
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
obviously you'll be three here and then
 

287
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,670
obviously you'll be three here and then
one is three and then one will be left

288
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
one is three and then one will be left
 

289
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,189
one is three and then one will be left
next would be one

290
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
next would be one
 

291
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,870
next would be one
okay yeah okay let's take a look at the

292
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
okay yeah okay let's take a look at the
 

293
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,150
okay yeah okay let's take a look at the
last example okay

294
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
last example okay
 

295
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,670
last example okay
three one two three look you swap with

296
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
three one two three look you swap with
 

297
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,189
three one two three look you swap with
one and three they'll become

298
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
one and three they'll become
 

299
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,430
one and three they'll become
one three one two but you are not at the

300
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
one three one two but you are not at the
 

301
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,990
one three one two but you are not at the
second position yeah all right look

302
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
second position yeah all right look
 

303
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,909
second position yeah all right look
okay you turn your to the right look one

304
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
okay you turn your to the right look one
 

305
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,029
okay you turn your to the right look one
swap is one so what do i put here

306
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
swap is one so what do i put here
 

307
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,950
swap is one so what do i put here
one slope is one it doesn't change so

308
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
one slope is one it doesn't change so
 

309
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,070
one slope is one it doesn't change so
what's your opportunity one

310
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
what's your opportunity one
 

311
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,749
what's your opportunity one
one okay one swapping two so it's two

312
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
one okay one swapping two so it's two
 

313
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,790
one okay one swapping two so it's two
one and you move it to the next so so

314
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
one and you move it to the next so so
 

315
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,430
one and you move it to the next so so
that's two

316
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
that's two
 

317
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,350
that's two
right and the next one will be one and

318
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
right and the next one will be one and
 

319
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,510
right and the next one will be one and
then when you it turns off the next one

320
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
then when you it turns off the next one
 

321
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,629
then when you it turns off the next one
is two

322
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
is two
 

323
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,670
is two
okay so look

324
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
okay so look
 

325
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,590
okay so look
first one three possibilities the second

326
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
first one three possibilities the second
 

327
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,749
first one three possibilities the second
one right two possibility and the third

328
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
one right two possibility and the third
 

329
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,430
one right two possibility and the third
one only one possibility because

330
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
one only one possibility because
 

331
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,950
one only one possibility because
you pick two and there's only one right

332
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
you pick two and there's only one right
 

333
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,110
you pick two and there's only one right
so there's six right

334
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
so there's six right
 

335
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,990
so there's six right
yes what's the complexity time

336
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
yes what's the complexity time
 

337
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,830
yes what's the complexity time
complexity

338
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
complexity
 

339
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,189
complexity
um

340
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199

 

341
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,629

that's very easy how many how many

342
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
that's very easy how many how many
 

343
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,309
that's very easy how many how many
possibilities are we give

344
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
possibilities are we give
 

345
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,430
possibilities are we give
can we get no how many possibilities are

346
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
can we get no how many possibilities are
 

347
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,990
can we get no how many possibilities are
we getting

348
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
we getting
 

349
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,430
we getting
here and factorial yeah whether

350
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
here and factorial yeah whether
 

351
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,870
here and factorial yeah whether
because look this is they did we need so

352
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
because look this is they did we need so
 

353
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,380
because look this is they did we need so
easy

354
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,390
easy
 

355
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,110
easy
[Music]

356
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
[Music]
 

357
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,350
[Music]
yes i know it's not easy what's the

358
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
yes i know it's not easy what's the
 

359
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,430
yes i know it's not easy what's the
space complexity if we want to

360
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
space complexity if we want to
 

361
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,629
space complexity if we want to
store all these in an array what's a

362
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
store all these in an array what's a
 

363
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,510
store all these in an array what's a
space conversation yeah that's an easy

364
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
space conversation yeah that's an easy
 

365
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,790
space conversation yeah that's an easy
question yeah

366
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
question yeah
 

367
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,150
question yeah
okay yeah easy okay

368
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
okay yeah easy okay
 

369
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,110
okay yeah easy okay
let's do this look cash no we don't need

370
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
let's do this look cash no we don't need
 

371
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,870
let's do this look cash no we don't need
the cash today defined because we are

372
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
the cash today defined because we are
 

373
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,749
the cash today defined because we are
generating

374
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
generating
 

375
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,749
generating
so we are generating these using the

376
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
so we are generating these using the
 

377
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,430
so we are generating these using the
recursion yeah recursion

378
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
recursion yeah recursion
 

379
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,309
recursion yeah recursion
yeah we define term let's say

380
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
yeah we define term let's say
 

381
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,990
yeah we define term let's say
permutation okay

382
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
permutation okay
 

383
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:51,830
permutation okay
let's give a number here right

384
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840

 

385
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,070

this is at least to store all the

386
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,080
this is at least to store all the
 

387
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,309
this is at least to store all the
permutations yeah

388
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
permutations yeah
 

389
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,469
permutations yeah
and given the numbers like one two three

390
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:58,479
and given the numbers like one two three
 

391
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,469
and given the numbers like one two three
which is unique okay

392
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
which is unique okay
 

393
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,909
which is unique okay
okay all right look now we define

394
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
okay all right look now we define
 

395
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,270
okay all right look now we define
another function called

396
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
another function called
 

397
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,629
another function called
uh let's call it helper helper function

398
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
uh let's call it helper helper function
 

399
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,230
uh let's call it helper helper function
okay or maybe dfs

400
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
okay or maybe dfs
 

401
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,029
okay or maybe dfs
that's what search okay or recursion

402
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
that's what search okay or recursion
 

403
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,350
that's what search okay or recursion
therefore search

404
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
therefore search
 

405
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,350
therefore search
yeah because recursion is kind of it's

406
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
yeah because recursion is kind of it's
 

407
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,749
yeah because recursion is kind of it's
not exactly okay maybe just to call it

408
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
not exactly okay maybe just to call it
 

409
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,029
not exactly okay maybe just to call it
helper

410
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
helper
 

411
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,430
helper
to prevent it's misleading okay and then

412
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
to prevent it's misleading okay and then
 

413
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,869
to prevent it's misleading okay and then
we have these current current

414
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879
we have these current current
 

415
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,550
we have these current current
okay current position so at the

416
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
okay current position so at the
 

417
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,550
okay current position so at the
beginning it will be

418
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560

 

419
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,190

one two three at the beginning you'll be

420
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
one two three at the beginning you'll be
 

421
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,949
one two three at the beginning you'll be
pointing here this is current okay which

422
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
pointing here this is current okay which
 

423
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,430
pointing here this is current okay which
is yellow okay currently use zero

424
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
is yellow okay currently use zero
 

425
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,630
is yellow okay currently use zero
helper and and what

426
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640

 

427
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,590

and what and maybe that's enough okay

428
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
and what and maybe that's enough okay
 

429
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,350
and what and maybe that's enough okay
uh look if current

430
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
uh look if current
 

431
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,110
uh look if current
equals

432
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120

 

433
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,470

length of numbers right alright

434
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
length of numbers right alright
 

435
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,670
length of numbers right alright
look if this current index is reaching

436
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
look if this current index is reaching
 

437
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,870
look if this current index is reaching
the end

438
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
the end
 

439
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,949
the end
so we have one permutation now we need

440
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
so we have one permutation now we need
 

441
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,870
so we have one permutation now we need
to add it into the answer yeah

442
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
to add it into the answer yeah
 

443
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,389
to add it into the answer yeah
so then we say answer a pen

444
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399

 

445
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,230

let's take a deep copy all right

446
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
let's take a deep copy all right
 

447
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,910
let's take a deep copy all right
remember we need to

448
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
remember we need to
 

449
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,710
remember we need to
take the copy because if you don't take

450
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
take the copy because if you don't take
 

451
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,670
take the copy because if you don't take
a deep copy you

452
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
a deep copy you
 

453
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,509
a deep copy you
you just copy the reference right we

454
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
you just copy the reference right we
 

455
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,870
you just copy the reference right we
don't want that right

456
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:26,880
don't want that right
 

457
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,509
don't want that right
all right so we copy lamp right

458
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
all right so we copy lamp right
 

459
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,190
all right so we copy lamp right
and then return that's it

460
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
and then return that's it
 

461
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,910
and then return that's it
and then now look look we we are from

462
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
and then now look look we we are from
 

463
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,710
and then now look look we we are from
colorado right

464
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
colorado right
 

465
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,269
colorado right
all right current now we need to go

466
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
all right current now we need to go
 

467
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,110
all right current now we need to go
through current current plus one current

468
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
through current current plus one current
 

469
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,150
through current current plus one current
pass two

470
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
pass two
 

471
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,630
pass two
until the end and swap each one to the

472
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
until the end and swap each one to the
 

473
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,070
until the end and swap each one to the
carbon right

474
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
carbon right
 

475
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,509
carbon right
yeah look then four

476
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
yeah look then four
 

477
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,829
yeah look then four
i in range

478
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839
i in range
 

479
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,110
i in range
current current and what

480
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
current current and what
 

481
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,509
current current and what
the end the end of the lumps so that

482
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
the end the end of the lumps so that
 

483
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,470
the end the end of the lumps so that
will be men's

484
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
will be men's
 

485
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,670
will be men's
lungs right all right

486
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
lungs right all right
 

487
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,470
lungs right all right
and then now i will be current current

488
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
and then now i will be current current
 

489
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,990
and then now i will be current current
plus one column plus two

490
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
plus one column plus two
 

491
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,829
plus one column plus two
and for each one i need to swap with

492
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
and for each one i need to swap with
 

493
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,110
and for each one i need to swap with
current right

494
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
current right
 

495
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:20,389
current right
right so look helper

496
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399

 

497
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,069

whatever one no

498
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
whatever one no
 

499
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,670
whatever one no
swap current so lumps

500
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
swap current so lumps
 

501
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,630
swap current so lumps
i and lumps

502
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
i and lumps
 

503
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,069
i and lumps
left and current needs to be solved how

504
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
left and current needs to be solved how
 

505
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,710
left and current needs to be solved how
do we swap

506
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
do we swap
 

507
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,230
do we swap
it a and b how do you swap the value of

508
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
it a and b how do you swap the value of
 

509
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,389
it a and b how do you swap the value of
a and b

510
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399

 

511
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,350

how do you solve it usually how do you

512
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
how do you solve it usually how do you
 

513
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,430
how do you solve it usually how do you
solve it

514
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
solve it
 

515
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,470
solve it
a how do you write it a and b i want to

516
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
a how do you write it a and b i want to
 

517
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,430
a how do you write it a and b i want to
solve the value of

518
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
solve the value of
 

519
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,630
solve the value of
add one no no no a and b i want to swap

520
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
add one no no no a and b i want to swap
 

521
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,190
add one no no no a and b i want to swap
a and b

522
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,200
a and b
 

523
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,790
a and b
values how do you slope it you know

524
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800

 

525
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,870

n b equals a no that wouldn't work

526
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
n b equals a no that wouldn't work
 

527
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,710
n b equals a no that wouldn't work
that's a good try that wouldn't work why

528
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
that's a good try that wouldn't work why
 

529
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,550
that's a good try that wouldn't work why
is that a equals b

530
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
is that a equals b
 

531
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,990
is that a equals b
a and b both equals b and b equals a a

532
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
a and b both equals b and b equals a a
 

533
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,710
a and b both equals b and b equals a a
and b both equals b right because a is

534
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
and b both equals b right because a is
 

535
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,310
and b both equals b right because a is
already equals to b

536
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
already equals to b
 

537
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,110
already equals to b
got it so how do you fix this you can

538
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
got it so how do you fix this you can
 

539
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,590
got it so how do you fix this you can
you can do this you can have a variable

540
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
you can do this you can have a variable
 

541
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,350
you can do this you can have a variable
t equals a i save the value in t right

542
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
t equals a i save the value in t right
 

543
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,949
t equals a i save the value in t right
right and then what a equals b

544
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
right and then what a equals b
 

545
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,550
right and then what a equals b
and then b equals one

546
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560

 

547
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,910

t where down look a equals b now b

548
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
t where down look a equals b now b
 

549
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,230
t where down look a equals b now b
equals t because t is the original value

550
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
equals t because t is the original value
 

551
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,110
equals t because t is the original value
of a

552
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
of a
 

553
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,710
of a
so let's swap yeah got it but you can

554
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
so let's swap yeah got it but you can
 

555
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,509
so let's swap yeah got it but you can
in person you can do this a comma b

556
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
in person you can do this a comma b
 

557
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,389
in person you can do this a comma b
equals b

558
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
equals b
 

559
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,430
equals b
comma a easy correct

560
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
comma a easy correct
 

561
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,750
comma a easy correct
a equals b b equals a simpler

562
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
a equals b b equals a simpler
 

563
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,430
a equals b b equals a simpler
yes okay so look here we only swap

what's what's here you're very close
 

629
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,670
what's what's here you're very close
look

630
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
look
 

631
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,710
look
i swap it look after i swap it two is

632
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
i swap it look after i swap it two is
 

633
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,710
i swap it look after i swap it two is
one then it becomes two one three but

634
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
one then it becomes two one three but
 

635
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,990
one then it becomes two one three but
now i can't i need to

636
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
now i can't i need to
 

637
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,949
now i can't i need to
move it i want to i already i already

determine
 

641
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,870
determine
this place i want to dominate the

642
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
this place i want to dominate the
 

643
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,509
this place i want to dominate the
the num no

644
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519

 

645
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,389

this is current and i have a current and

646
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
this is current and i have a current and
 

647
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,990
this is current and i have a current and
i want to move it to the next what's

648
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
i want to move it to the next what's
 

649
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,629
i want to move it to the next what's
what what's that

650
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
what what's that
 

651
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,230
what what's that
this this is current

652
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
this this is current
 

653
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,430
this this is current
and then equals three current

654
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
and then equals three current
 

655
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,030
and then equals three current
equals no alright you need to understand

656
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
equals no alright you need to understand
 

657
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,509
equals no alright you need to understand
this

658
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
this
 

659
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,629
this
i'm currently pointing here i want to

660
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
i'm currently pointing here i want to
 

661
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,550
i'm currently pointing here i want to
i want to try each possibility of this

662
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
i want to try each possibility of this
 

663
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,750
i want to try each possibility of this
position right

664
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
position right
 

665
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,949
position right
so that would be one two three i swapped

666
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
so that would be one two three i swapped
 

667
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,030
so that would be one two three i swapped
one with one i swapped two with one i

668
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
one with one i swapped two with one i
 

669
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,030
one with one i swapped two with one i
swapped three with one after i

670
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
swapped three with one after i
 

671
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,069
swapped three with one after i
make after i determine this place i need

672
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
make after i determine this place i need
 

673
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,350
make after i determine this place i need
to permeate

674
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
to permeate
 

675
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,710
to permeate
with the current this is current and i

676
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,720
with the current this is current and i
 

677
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,710
with the current this is current and i
want to move it to the next one

678
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720

 

679
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,870

then

680
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880

 

681
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,870

so hard to understand this do you

682
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
so hard to understand this do you
 

683
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,910
so hard to understand this do you
understand yes

684
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
understand yes
 

685
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,990
understand yes
because the current is incrementing and

686
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
because the current is incrementing and
 

687
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,350
because the current is incrementing and
when it's recently end

688
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
when it's recently end
 

689
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,069
when it's recently end
it means we have a permutation and then

690
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
it means we have a permutation and then
 

691
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,310
it means we have a permutation and then
we editory answer right

692
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
we editory answer right
 

693
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,590
we editory answer right
so here i'm calling helper what should i

694
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
so here i'm calling helper what should i
 

695
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,790
so here i'm calling helper what should i
put here value

696
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:02,800
put here value
 

697
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,829
put here value
and then return what answer

698
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
and then return what answer
 

699
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,470
and then return what answer
return answer yes and help this is what

700
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
return answer yes and help this is what
 

701
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,829
return answer yes and help this is what
kind of value is this

702
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839
kind of value is this
 

703
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,829
kind of value is this
sorry k up with the initial value

704
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
sorry k up with the initial value
 

705
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,509
sorry k up with the initial value
there's no current here i want to

706
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
there's no current here i want to
 

707
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,230
there's no current here i want to
initiate from my first position first

708
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
initiate from my first position first
 

709
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,870
initiate from my first position first
position

710
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
position
 

711
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,790
position
is what length

712
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:22,800
is what length
 

713
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:30,389
is what length
what's the first position of the array

714
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399

 

715
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,910

what's the first partition you just need

716
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
what's the first partition you just need
 

717
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,749
what's the first partition you just need
to give me a number i want to start from

718
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:35,759
to give me a number i want to start from
 

719
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,110
to give me a number i want to start from
the first position

720
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
the first position
 

721
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,790
the first position
no it's not the one where is the second

722
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
no it's not the one where is the second
 

723
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,030
no it's not the one where is the second
what's the first position

724
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
what's the first position
 

725
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,629
what's the first position
yes because yeah this is the first one

726
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
yes because yeah this is the first one
 

727
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,389
yes because yeah this is the first one
that's the big zero

728
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
that's the big zero
 

729
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,389
that's the big zero
yeah it's yellow and then the movement

730
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
yeah it's yellow and then the movement
 

731
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,069
yeah it's yellow and then the movement
moving one column which is the end we

732
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
moving one column which is the end we
 

733
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,030
moving one column which is the end we
have a permutation

734
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
have a permutation
 

735
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,749
have a permutation
do you get it do you really understand

736
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
do you get it do you really understand
 

737
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,189
do you get it do you really understand
look

738
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
look
 

739
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,710
look
yeah look one two

740
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
yeah look one two
 

741
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,590
yeah look one two
three yeah right current is here i'm at

742
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,600
three yeah right current is here i'm at
 

743
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:01,990
three yeah right current is here i'm at
the

744
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
the
 

745
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,509
the
beginning zero y when current is zero

746
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
beginning zero y when current is zero
 

747
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,710
beginning zero y when current is zero
i will be from zero to

748
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
i will be from zero to
 

749
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,069
i will be from zero to
three right to two right yeah i

750
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
three right to two right yeah i
 

751
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,189
three right to two right yeah i
in range current current is zero now i'm

752
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
in range current current is zero now i'm
 

753
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,550
in range current current is zero now i'm
right all right

754
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
right all right
 

755
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,829
right all right
and then equals one then sum equals one

756
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839
and then equals one then sum equals one
 

757
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,629
and then equals one then sum equals one
then

758
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639

 

759
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,430

how many elements three three okay zero

760
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
how many elements three three okay zero
 

761
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,350
how many elements three three okay zero
two three but not up to three so gl

762
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
two three but not up to three so gl
 

763
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,030
two three but not up to three so gl
one two right zero one two i will be

764
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,040
one two right zero one two i will be
 

765
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,269
one two right zero one two i will be
zero one two one i is zero

766
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
zero one two one i is zero
 

767
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,310
zero one two one i is zero
i swap it with num zero numbers here so

768
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
i swap it with num zero numbers here so
 

769
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,150
i swap it with num zero numbers here so
i swap this value with excel so it

770
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
i swap this value with excel so it
 

771
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,949
i swap this value with excel so it
doesn't change

772
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
doesn't change
 

773
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,790
doesn't change
right yes when i is one i swap

774
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
right yes when i is one i swap
 

775
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,230
right yes when i is one i swap
one with two right yeah when i

776
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
one with two right yeah when i
 

777
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,150
one with two right yeah when i
one lumps equals three uh two i swap

778
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
one lumps equals three uh two i swap
 

779
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,310
one lumps equals three uh two i swap
with three and one right why i need to

780
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
with three and one right why i need to
 

781
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,829
with three and one right why i need to
drop each time i

782
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
drop each time i
 

783
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,870
drop each time i
that i'm determining this position

784
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:58,880
that i'm determining this position
 

785
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,870
that i'm determining this position
i'm checking how many possibilities

786
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
i'm checking how many possibilities
 

787
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,870
i'm checking how many possibilities
that's three possibilities right

788
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880
that's three possibilities right
 

789
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,150
that's three possibilities right
yeah so i'm checking

790
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,160
yeah so i'm checking
 

791
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,350
yeah so i'm checking
i'm letting each possibility stand

792
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,360
i'm letting each possibility stand
 

793
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,829
i'm letting each possibility stand
in this position right after i

794
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
in this position right after i
 

795
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,630
in this position right after i
understand

796
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
understand
 

797
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,669
understand
that position and then i need to move it

798
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
that position and then i need to move it
 

799
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,110
that position and then i need to move it
to the next one

800
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
to the next one
 

801
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,150
to the next one
which is column plus one right column

802
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
which is column plus one right column
 

803
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,270
which is column plus one right column
plus one right

804
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
plus one right
 

805
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,110
plus one right
and i'm dealing another similar problem

806
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
and i'm dealing another similar problem
 

807
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,350
and i'm dealing another similar problem
with this with a smaller size of problem

808
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
with this with a smaller size of problem
 

809
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:25,829
with this with a smaller size of problem
right

810
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
right
 

811
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,990
right
but after i theory with it i need to

812
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
but after i theory with it i need to
 

813
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,830
but after i theory with it i need to
swap it back right this is this

814
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
swap it back right this is this
 

815
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,669
swap it back right this is this
this is very important i need to swap it

816
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
this is very important i need to swap it
 

817
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,870
this is very important i need to swap it
back

818
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
back
 

819
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,270
back
all right yeah okay

820
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
all right yeah okay
 

821
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,510
all right yeah okay
so look one two three and then i swap it

822
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
so look one two three and then i swap it
 

823
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,630
so look one two three and then i swap it
swap it like two then will be two

824
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
swap it like two then will be two
 

825
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,909
swap it like two then will be two
one three right two one three but after

826
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
one three right two one three but after
 

827
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,470
one three right two one three but after
i

828
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
i
 

829
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,510
i
i do this i need to swap it back so

830
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
i do this i need to swap it back so
 

831
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,029
i do this i need to swap it back so
i need to swap it back so because if i

832
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:55,039

00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
swap it back like two one three
 

839
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,789
swap it back like two one three
and then the next time then it becomes

840
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
and then the next time then it becomes
 

841
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,549
and then the next time then it becomes
three and two swap it but i

842
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
three and two swap it but i
 

843
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,549
three and two swap it but i
originally i want to swap it one and

844
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
originally i want to swap it one and
 

845
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,549
originally i want to swap it one and
three right if i swap it land that will

846
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:08,559
three right if i swap it land that will
 

847
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,070
three right if i swap it land that will
become three one two then

848
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
become three one two then
 

849
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,110
become three one two then
there will be some missing got it

850
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
there will be some missing got it
 

851
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,510
there will be some missing got it
do you understand this one because for

852
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
do you understand this one because for
 

853
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,390
do you understand this one because for
this one

854
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
this one
 

855

one two three i want to swap it with uh
there will be one two three two one

858
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
there will be one two three two one
 

859
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,750
there will be one two three two one
three and three

860
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
three and three
 

861
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,870
three and three
two one right

862
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
two one right
 

863
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,270
two one right
yeah that's uh i'm talking about the

864
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
yeah that's uh i'm talking about the
 

865
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,310
yeah that's uh i'm talking about the
first position yeah

866
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
first position yeah
 

867
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,150
first position yeah
swap it swap it swap it if i don't swap

868
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,160
swap it swap it swap it if i don't swap
 

869
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,110
swap it swap it swap it if i don't swap
it back

870
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
it back
 

871
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,430
it back
look if this is i don't swap it back

872
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
look if this is i don't swap it back
 

873
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,390
look if this is i don't swap it back
then that would be

874
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
then that would be
 

875
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,510
then that would be
three and two that will become three

876
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
three and two that will become three
 

877
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,270
three and two that will become three
one two not not three to one all right

878
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
one two not not three to one all right
 

879
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,470
one two not not three to one all right
yeah does it make sense yeah

880
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
yeah does it make sense yeah
 

881
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,510
yeah does it make sense yeah
really yeah okay

882
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:51,520
really yeah okay
 

883
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,710
really yeah okay
okay so

884
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,720
okay so
 

885
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,470
okay so
can you explain to me why this is a deep

886
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,480
can you explain to me why this is a deep
 

887
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,750
can you explain to me why this is a deep
copy

888
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760

 

889
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,270

just make sure you're listening

890
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280

 

891
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,510

it would be the same if we not deep copy

892
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
it would be the same if we not deep copy
 

893
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,630
it would be the same if we not deep copy
then if i push leave answer

894
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
then if i push leave answer
 

895
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,270
then if i push leave answer
as answer append alarms you'll be all

896
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280
as answer append alarms you'll be all
 

897
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,909
as answer append alarms you'll be all
the same

898
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
the same
 

899
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,990
the same
you'll be all the same yeah that's what

900
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,000
you'll be all the same yeah that's what
 

901
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,830
you'll be all the same yeah that's what
i said because it's a reference it's

902
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
i said because it's a reference it's
 

903
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,510
i said because it's a reference it's
alias you know alias yeah is that it's

904

and call you uh mr lai
mr airy both are the same person

910
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
mr airy both are the same person
 

911
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,909
mr airy both are the same person
yeah if then if i add a pen lamp

912
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919
yeah if then if i add a pen lamp
 

913
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,029
yeah if then if i add a pen lamp
then all i get is

914
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
then all i get is
 

915
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,230
then all i get is
six alright all i get is a six copy

916
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
six alright all i get is a six copy
 

917
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,029
six alright all i get is a six copy
a six reference to lungs then that would

918
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:49,039
a six reference to lungs then that would
 

919
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:49,430
a six reference to lungs then that would
be

920
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
be
 

921
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,430
be
the result will be all one two three one

922
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
the result will be all one two three one
 

923
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,789
the result will be all one two three one
two three one two three one two three

924
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
two three one two three one two three
 

925
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,150
two three one two three one two three
one two three because

926
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
one two three because
 

927
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,350
one two three because
they are the same right i'm right

928
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
they are the same right i'm right
 

929
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,430
they are the same right i'm right
but when i edit when i need to add the

930
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
but when i edit when i need to add the
 

931
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,230
but when i edit when i need to add the
numbers lumps to the answer

932
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,240
numbers lumps to the answer
 

933
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,350
numbers lumps to the answer
then at that point at the point of time

934
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
then at that point at the point of time
 

935
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,789
then at that point at the point of time
the nouns contains different

936
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:06,799
the nouns contains different
 

937
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,710
the nouns contains different
permutations right it could contain

938
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
permutations right it could contain
 

939
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,990
permutations right it could contain
three to one right

940
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
three to one right
 

941
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,430
three to one right
all right and then i need to dip copy

942
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
all right and then i need to dip copy
 

943
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,350
all right and then i need to dip copy
and i will copy that value three two one

944
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
and i will copy that value three two one
 

945
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,630
and i will copy that value three two one
to a new array

946
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
to a new array
 

947
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,190
to a new array
right it will be diff so it will be the

948
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
right it will be diff so it will be the
 

949
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,750
right it will be diff so it will be the
right so

950
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:19,760
right so
 

951
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,669
right so
so basically it's like that what's the

952
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
so basically it's like that what's the
 

953
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:28,870
so basically it's like that what's the
copy okay

954
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880

 

955
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,830

equals all right equals

956
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:32,840
equals all right equals
 

957
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,470
equals all right equals
e r

958
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
e r
 

959
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,990
e r
i c okay alright equals

960
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
i c okay alright equals
 

961
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,590
i c okay alright equals
okay and then i need to do this like

962
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:43,600
okay and then i need to do this like
 

963
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,710
okay and then i need to do this like
uh here i see r on z

964
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:46,720
uh here i see r on z
 

965
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,950
uh here i see r on z
yeah and then i have another one eric

966
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
yeah and then i have another one eric
 

967
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,149
yeah and then i have another one eric
two

968
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
two
 

969
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,310
two
eric two equals eric

970
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
eric two equals eric
 

971
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,070
eric two equals eric
so what do you think what will happen if

972
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
so what do you think what will happen if
 

973

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:05,170
i change look if i do this
erry2 every

976

so what do you think the area at arab 2

980
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:15,919
so what do you think the area at arab 2
 

981
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:22,950
so what do you think the area at arab 2
will be

982
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:22,960

 

983
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,390

so area to be what

984
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
so area to be what
 

985
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,630
so area to be what
i think this value will be what an array

986
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
i think this value will be what an array
 

987
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:38,789
i think this value will be what an array
of what

988
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799

 

989
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,630

yeah that's what you mean because this

990
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
yeah that's what you mean because this
 

991
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,230
yeah that's what you mean because this
is the reference you're pointing to the

992
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
is the reference you're pointing to the
 

993
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,110
is the reference you're pointing to the
same position

994
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
same position
 

995
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,510
same position
but but look if i say this deep copy
