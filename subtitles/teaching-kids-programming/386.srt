1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,850
[Music]

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,880
okay so yesterday we talked about

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,639
reducing the number to zero yes let's

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,200
review this a little bit yeah we have a

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,799
10 and we want to review uh the dlc to

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,480
zero so

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,560
we have only two operations the first

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,560
one is to

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,880
subtract one from it and the other one

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,480
is to divide it by two right so we

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,720
prefer the division yeah because that

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,960
will help us to bring down the number as

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,880
quickly more quickly than subject one

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,600
i'm right yeah so ten that will give me

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,040
five divided by two and then four

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,680
and then

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,000
two and then one and then zero okay okay

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,480
so that the only step one two three four

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
five five step to zero okay

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,039
so now today's problem

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,440
today's problem is slightly

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,520
uh different is that we start from any

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,760
number one we start from one and we want

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,719
to reach the number

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,719
10

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,120
or any number we want to reach any

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,920
number and each operation

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,840
you are allowed to plus one okay so this

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,320
is opposite plus one

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,600
or multiply two

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,840
right

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,760
right so

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,400
the if you look at these

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,320
these two this is exactly the same like

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,080
yesterday and this is the opposite but

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,119
we are given a one more constraint here

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
is that

38
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,200
for the multiply two you can only do it

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,880
let's say

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,119
uh

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,560
n uh let's say

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,400
m number

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
terms okay

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,880
okay

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,000
yeah so let's say if we if we

46
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,759
are allowed to multiply

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,920
let's say if we are allowed to multiply

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,920
one time so what's the number of what's

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,320
the mean number operations to make one

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,320
to ten okay so m equals one you are

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,320
allowed to only we are allowed to do

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,560
this multiply one time so what's the

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,520
answer come on anybody

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,799
what

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,960
yes sir

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,719
we are allowed to do this multiply one

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,079
time what's the what's the

58
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,000
minimum

59
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,560
if we start from one we want to go from

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,640
one to ten so what's the number what's

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,319
the minimum number of moves we can do

62
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,319
this multiply two one only one time

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,520
yeah five

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,840
five times

65
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
yeah okay so what's your what's your

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,840
approach to do this

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,040
what's your approach

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,440
i mean

69
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,440
what's your approach

70
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,480
[Music]

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,800
we are multiplying so we are talking

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,840
about division so you are talking about

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,840
reverse yeah

74
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,929
you start with n yeah

75
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,929
[Music]

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
right yeah okay so we can make this

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,879
problem the obviously we think inversely

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
yeah inversely we think the opposite way

79
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,000
okay

80
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,480
this is the same so we we have

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,599
multiplied two right so

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,480
so much if we start with number n

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,159
instead of starting number one so we

84
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,480
eventually make this problem like

85
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,480
yesterday we we have two operation minus

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,959
one and divided by two but the only

87
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,319
difference is that we follow division we

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,480
have n number you can do this at most m

89
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,560
number of times so but

90
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,879
but as you said i mean at the beginning

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,319
if we we can do this division we prefer

92
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,000
to do little division why is that

93
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,560
because look a thousand if we do that

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,799
division now become 500 and now we

95
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,440
reduce the number by 500

96
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,280
but if you do it from 10 to 5 only

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,319
reduce to 5 times

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,480
you only reduce the five yeah yeah

99
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,280
so if we do it early

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,200
we can bring down the numbers quickly

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,680
right so we prefer that so we can do

102
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,959
this quickly right and with these

103
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,120
numbers so if so the strategy is very

104
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,840
obvious that if we can do this division

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,640
we'll do the division

106
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,639
bye

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,440
so how when is the time we can do this

108
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,639
division when the number is even and we

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,680
still have

110
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,080
n number of times for division to do m

111
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,400
is bigger than zero otherwise we can

112
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,120
just remove uh subtract subshell one

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,680
until we get a to one okay

114
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,919
okay let's quickly write it we can do we

115
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,960
can write this uh using two different

116
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,720
approaches one is uh let's one is let's

117
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,080
do it in recursion okay let's say ef f

118
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,880
function

119
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,000
we are now at number n and we have n

120
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,320
number of times of division okay

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,639
yeah what did that is just say what's n

122
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,639
okay

123
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,360
division n is the number and m is the

124
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,280
number of division okay now look if n

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,759
equal equal one then we just we just

126
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,680
stand here between zero yeah if the n is

127
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,000
zero it's one

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,280
yeah we already

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,800
at destination okay now look

130
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,039
now now what's next look if

131
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,479
if what if n

132
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,960
if m is bigger than zero right look if m

133
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,919
is bigger than zero we have n

134
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
uh

135
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,840
we have uh we still have the

136
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,000
divisions to do

137
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,919
we can apply and also now current number

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
is a

139
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,479
even number right

140
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,560
yeah

141
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,199
but if we have enough we have enough

142
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,400
division to do and then we we are we are

143
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,880
now n is even number alright yeah so

144
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,560
long return one return one

145
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,720
return

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,680
what's the time here come on can you do

147
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,759
this using the f function look so if i'm

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,400
saying okay so i have one more i can do

149
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,440
this one more division so then i can say

150
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,280
i apply one one plus f

151
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,639
n divided by 2 and m minus 1 right look

152
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,199
what does this mean

153
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,000
yeah this we divided by 2 so this is the

154
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,919
new number we have used one

155
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,400
division

156
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,479
now okay so we have used one so we have

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,319
applied one more operation so that's one

158
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,840
here all right okay

159
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,880
okay now now

160
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
so what's next so

161
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,319
if

162
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,680
if the and at this point then m is zero

163
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,680
right and

164
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,880
okay now we have to say

165
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,319
if

166
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
okay if one

167
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,720
if

168
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,120
n is yellow

169
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,440
okay so if m zero what happened

170
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,880
so we can't do the division anymore so

171
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,720
what's there what's the answer what's

172
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,919
the we can't do the division anymore so

173
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,080
what's the answer

174
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,199
what was the number of moves to bring n

175
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,720
to one

176
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,280
so we have a number

177
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,800
n and now we we want to bring it down to

178
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,840
one what's the number we come to

179
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,840
division so what's the number of moves

180
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,160
we're done that's that's that's good

181
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,759
return n minus one yeah

182
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,720
yeah easy yeah

183
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,560
okay no if if m

184
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,440
okay so what and what what's missing

185
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,759
here what's the news in here

186
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,080
what's what's missing yeah come on

187
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,080
um

188
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,039
okay so now now we need to do what if n

189
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,280
is uh it's all number okay so now here n

190
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,840
is on our number right if n is all

191
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,560
number then what happened

192
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,680
we minus one thank you very much then we

193
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,800
look here

194
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,599
here we just do this one plus

195
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,039
as

196
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,360
n minus one

197
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,240
and then i'm right okay

198
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,039
yeah look

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,160
okay can i repeat this if the number is

200
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,400
one

201
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,319
it is what if number is one we reach the

202
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,520
destination okay

203
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,840
can i have this please

204
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,520
okay okay this is good for me okay look

205
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:08,080
if n is one return zero okay

206
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,800
if m is bigger than one we have

207
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,360
n

208
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,120
divisions to two and this is even number

209
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,120
then return one plus these look we have

210
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
div divided by two so this is the new

211
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
number new target and n minus one which

212
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,720
is the division

213
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,160
or that's the one yeah because we have

214
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,280
used one division right if m is zero if

215
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,720
m is zero that we have no we we have uh

216
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,880
so what does it mean we have no

217
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,599
motivation so the only way we can bring

218
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,719
down n to one is by subtraction so

219
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,399
that's a minus one as you say otherwise

220
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,880
otherwise we we

221
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,080
we're not sure we're not sure then in

222
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,320
this case here what's here it could be

223
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,120
it could be one it could be m

224
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,399
bigger than zero or

225
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,839
one

226
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:59,920
or n is is even uh n is all number okay

227
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,080
so at this here you'll be

228
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,519
one of these right if m is bigger than

229
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,000
zero then i need to do this but n is odd

230
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,399
i also can do this in both cases i need

231
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,800
to plug one and here is the subtraction

232
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,519
okay yeah yeah make sense

233
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,760
okay so we can do this iteratively okay

234
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,000
we can do this iteratively

235
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,399
how can we do this iteratively

236
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,080
so look we can just do this define

237
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,240
let's say f n right so now look we have

238
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,839
the answer answer equals zero

239
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,640
so while

240
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,680
n is bigger than one right

241
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,880
n

242
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,920
okay so let's

243
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,560
m here okay and

244
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,360
m is bigger than zero right right so we

245
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,360
can do this look

246
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
what

247
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
if

248
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,399
n

249
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,959
is

250
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,440
even number if anything even a number so

251
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,519
what happens if a is even numb uh

252
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,040
this is if n is all number we can only

253
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,000
subtract one so

254
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,920
n minus equals one and the answer needs

255
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
to plus equal one right

256
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,760
as

257
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,519
if n is odd number so we prefer the

258
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,320
division so what

259
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,040
n divided by equal to and answer plus

260
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,880
equal one okay look both cases n surplus

261
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,760
equals one so let's move this a little

262
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,120
bit to the you know

263
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,079
outside so we can to make it clear yeah

264
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,640
uh look if n minus look at this is

265
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,279
division we we have used one division so

266
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,640
this here we need to minus n minus

267
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,600
equals one right

268
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,399
yeah okay so now

269
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,120
n

270
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,040
what should we determine what

271
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,040
okay so if

272
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,360
look here

273
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,279
why n is bigger than one and we have

274
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,680
division and then outside

275
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,320
what's outside if the loop terminates

276
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,560
here what's the outside if outside here

277
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,040
what's the condition

278
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,040
what's the opposite of this

279
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,839
so while this condition is true we do

280
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,079
this and if i'm outside what happened

281
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,079
so

282
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,240
so what was this if n is bigger than one

283
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,240
so what will happen here

284
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,880
it could be one right n is equal to one

285
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,720
or

286
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,000
look so the opposite is like n equals 1

287
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,560
or

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,279
m is equal to 0 right

289
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,040
yeah if n equals 1

290
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,200
then we are done right

291
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,800
but if m is 0 it means we have no

292
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,800
division at all

293
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,760
so we can how do we bring down the

294
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,480
numbers from n to one

295
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,640
you just say and what

296
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,760
if n equals zero what's the how many

297
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,760
steps to bring n to one

298
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,200
right

299
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,839
when m is zero and

300
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,880
may not be one right so let's then how

301
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,160
do we bring the n to one

302
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,959
n minus one and minus one yeah yeah so n

303
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,800
minus one n minus one but

304
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,839
remember we have an answer here we have

305
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,040
used answer here so plus answer right

306
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,000
yeah

307
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,519
does it make sense here

308
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,360
does it make sense here

309
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
which one do you think

310
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,839
is better which one do you think is

311
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,839
better

312
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,000
look this one yeah and divided by two

313
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,480
you can also write it as and shift shift

314
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,680
shift equals one okay this is two hours

315
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,360
if i listen when n is even number okay

316
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,320
one anything in one these two are

317
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,720
equivalent okay these two are equivalent

318
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,720
okay so

319
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,320
uh

320
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,920
this is make sense here this one

321
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,160
okay so what have you learned today so

322
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,160
far

323
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,889
[Music]

324
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:07,040
so i'm sorry sorry i mean what is it

325
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,440
me and me moves to reach targets

326
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,360
okay so what how what's the approach

327
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,959
here what's the approach here

328
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,920
we are trying to

329
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,920
prioritize which operation

330
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,920
um

331
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,240
[Music]

332
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,720
yeah because we have a number we have a

333
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,920
restricted number of times to do this uh

334
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,120
multiplier if we think it diversely

335
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,880
we you we if we inverse the problem

336
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,199
and the operation will be subtraction

337
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,959
and division right and we prefer the

338
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,120
division we want to do this division as

339
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,279
soon as we can right because it will

340
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,399
help bring down the numbers quicker

341
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,680
am right

342
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,680
okay so look this is n this is current

343
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,480
number let me repeat again the n is the

344
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,800
number m is the number of

345
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,480
division we can do when n is the one

346
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,959
that will return zero yeah obviously we

347
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,279
are attacking when n we have when we

348
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,000
have division and then this currently n

349
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,240
is a even number then we can do the

350
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,600
division yeah and divided by two and we

351
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,760
have one less

352
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,959
division here one plus

353
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,760
if n

354
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,079
look if n is zero means that we have we

355
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,560
can't do the division anymore so we we

356
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,839
can we we need n minus one to bring down

357
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,240
the end one right otherwise here he'll

358
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,399
feel clear what's the case if m is

359
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,279
bigger than one zero

360
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,199
or

361
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,519
n is a

362
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,160
odd number then in both cases we need to

363
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,720
subtract one right and then we we

364
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,959
calling the recursion to to find a

365
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,839
smaller problem which is n minus one m

366
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,800
right

367
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,839
yeah

368
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,839
minus one here okay and here

369
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,560
we repeated it yeah answer is the number

370
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,680
of steps we've taken so far when n is

371
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,399
bigger than one and we have like more

372
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,240
we can still do this division when n is

373
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,839
a odd number

374
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,399
we subtract a one

375
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,399
because because this is the only way to

376
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,639
bring down the number when it when n is

377
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,120
an odd number otherwise

378
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,079
otherwise when we have a steel division

379
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,959
to do

380
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,160
then we can do this division and

381
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,399
we need to

382
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,320
remember to to do what to subtract the

383
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,000
division okay

384
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,040
and then answer the passing equivalent

385
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,040
because it applies to both branches and

386
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,720
when the loop breaks

387
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,639
when the blue breaks

388
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,000
so we still need to print the number

389
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,800
from n because m might not be one right

390
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,680
yeah so n minus one plus answer

391
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,959
okay that's it for today

392
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,320
what's the time complexity by the way

393
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,639
what's the time conversation look we

394
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,560
have a division to print out a number if

395
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,519
we have a division

396
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,440
okay so the best cases is what if n

397
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,560
if n is a

398
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,399
number to the power yeah like 128 so you

399
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,440
always divided by 2 right 128 64

400
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,639
32

401
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
16

402
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,959
8 four two one right

403
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,160
log in

404
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,120
yeah

405
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,120
okay that's it for today bye bye bye bye
