1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,640
all right okay so look at these there

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,440
are two positive numbers we're given two

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,300
positive number we want to find out the

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,460
number of common factor common factors

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,800
what's common factor look these are one

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,980
two three six these four numbers both

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,180
divides 12 and 6. so therefore right can

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,140
you find more

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,539
okay how about 25 and 30. how many

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,880
common factors uh one

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,579
this one no I said there's a common

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,730
factor of one yeah of course

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,760
five and five anymore

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,760
[Music]

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,760
um

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,559
no yeah no just okay so given two

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,879
numbers A and B positive numbers we want

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,039
to find out the comment the number of

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,100
common factors for A and B the common

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,520
factor is the number that divides both

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,500
positive integers given least 25 and 30

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,899
how do we know it's two how do you check

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,340
these two right you said to prove us

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,180
that's a good idea but how do we prove

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,700
us we check every time tables every time

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,939
table so we check from two two yeah

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,860
because one is there right one is a is a

28
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,720
common factor for any two numbers all

29
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,580
right what's the biggest number we have

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,799
to check

31
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,600
the

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,420
the biggest number is off yeah huh

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,119
we can do more than that how is a good

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,820
guess half of what

35
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,140
half of the smallest number half of a

36
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,619
smallest number that's a good guess but

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,820
we can even do better so 25 30.

38
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:45,299
do we need to go to 12 or 12.5 12 right

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,380
do we need to no no that's right because

40
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,060
we have another number so what's this

41
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,479
gcp do you still remember

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,220
Places come divisor create this comment

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,560
divisor 25 and 30. what's the greatest

44
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,600
common divisor five five so we need just

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,920
need to go to five am I right so what's

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,399
the definition of greatest common

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,520
divisor is the greatest

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,099
divisor between two numbers right so

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,140
there's no such thing divisor that goes

50
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,599
beyond the greatest common device am I

51
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,760
right yeah another example

52
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,760
14 and 21.

53
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,480
yeah and then how many factors common

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,080
factors

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,860
hmm

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,680
okay two yes two okay and animal okay uh

57
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,360
another example yes four and

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
six

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,739
two

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,300
which is one two eh okay I need to come

61
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,780
up with an example with more than two

62
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,800
okay let's say

63
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,739
126. 6 16 and

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:55,319
123 and 64 and

65
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:58,319
24.24 and 4096. one one two two

66
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,319
yes

67
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,420
um

68
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,599
what's the name a yes anymore no that's

69
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,340
it all right okay so 16 and 24 hours of

70
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,620
the greatest common divisor eight eight

71
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,300
we just have to check from two right two

72
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,000
three four five six

73
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,920
seven eight these numbers if they can

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,260
divide both numbers then we incrementize

75
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,540
them right yeah so create this common

76
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,099
devices CCT the python provides this

77
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,720
function but do you still remember how

78
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,659
we're doing this uh greatest common

79
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,500
device for example 25 and 30. how do we

80
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:36,000
know it's five we use this right look

81
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,680
25 divided by 30. the remaining 25 right

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,599
so we just move here

83
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:45,599
okay so that's 30 and 25. 30 and 25

84
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:49,680
divided by 25 remaining 5.

85
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,280
right move here that's 25 five 25

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,780
divided by 5 remaining

87
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,900
0.0 this is the common divisor okay

88
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,379
let's try another example 14 and 21.

89
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,920
right 14 divided by 21 remaining 14

90
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,959
right we move this we shift here 21 14.

91
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,480
so basically when a is more than b we

92
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,280
just swap it around 21 divided by 14

93
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,959
remaining

94
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,859
seven

95
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,500
yeah 14 divided device uh this is 14 7.

96
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:22,320
14 divided by seven remaining

97
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,540
zero right so when it's zero we present

98
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,280
this seven right correct correct is

99
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,520
common devices we use to touch algorithm

100
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:35,900
right so I'm just going to quickly like

101
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:40,680
that Define g c d a b y p is not equal

102
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:43,680
right a b equals p a modulus B and then

103
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,020
return return a right the simple as that

104
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,400
this is a simple implementation of the

105
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,600
common device and we can use the

106
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:56,520
application as well so if B then return

107
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:58,919
g g d uh B A modulus B otherwise 310 AI

108
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:04,800
okay okay coming back to that question

109
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:06,660
so x equals g c d a b and then answer

110
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,580
equal at the beginning set it to one

111
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,280
because one is always the common divisor

112
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,960
right and for

113
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:17,540
I in when we start from the second

114
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,820
number up to X Plus One X inclusive if x

115
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:25,320
modulus I equal equals zero then answer

116
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:28,860
plus equal one return answer right this

117
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,560
can be found in one line return sum

118
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,580
right some one for I in 2 to the X plus

119
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,539
one if x modulus I equals zero okay the

120
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:41,460
time complexity for the gcd is log

121
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:42,960
minimum of A and B okay you don't need

122
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,639
to go into the details but this is

123
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,580
roughly the counter black State there's

124
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,259
a mathematics analytics uh on getting

125
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,860
this Samsung Galaxy we're not going to

126
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:55,320
go into deeper today okay so time to

127
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,919
next is this one the most time consuming

128
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:02,419
times infinity loop okay so what have

129
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,419
you learned today and that's it

130
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:06,900
you go first

131
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,340
so what's the problem and how are you

132
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,700
show me it okay

133
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,000
we are using decorative

134
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,340
[Music]

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,620
and you have two numbers and you want to

136
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,160
try to find

137
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:23,039
the the numbers that play with the

138
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,419
number of common factors right yeah the

139
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,759
common factors is the number that

140
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,860
devices we just need to prove us from

141
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:33,660
two to Let's create this common devices

142
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:36,000
okay so we so semi we we're trying to

143
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,340
figure out like how many number of

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,539
common factors there and we're using

145
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,900
them

146
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,620
the greatest common divisor and so and

147
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,080
say

148
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:51,539
and so uh solution is is

149
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,520
getting dividing both of them and

150
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:56,160
getting the remainder and then keep

151
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,100
doing both of them and then do and then

152
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,900
and then and then repeating and

153
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,160
repeating until you get the remainder of

154
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,979
zero and the divisor you divide to give

155
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,380
a reminder is is the greatest common

156
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:14,639
divisor well done good job okay that's

157
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,639
it for today bye-bye bye-bye
