1
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:09,360
okay so we are given an array of digits

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,719
one single digit like

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,960
uh two one three okay let's just take

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,539
this one three digits each number in the

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,760
alert is one digit so

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,539
the question is that we want to find out

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,080
all the three digit number

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,420
three digit number okay

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,460
and it has to be even so three digit

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,680
even number

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,520
that's impossible

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,739
you hear me out okay okay um

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,680
unless you have zeros like two times

14
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,640
three three digit even number and no

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,700
leading zeros oh that is impossible and

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,399
also the numbers could be duplicate in

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,899
the original race you need to

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,440
concatenate concatenation of the digits

19
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,980
for example here I can do two one three

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,780
right this is a three digit but yeah but

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,600
it's not even I'm about I can do three

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,360
one two do you just have to order them

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,460
that's right yes but it could be money

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,340
right it could be another zero we need

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,080
to return all these three digits so four

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,080
numbers we want to keep

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,080
zeros

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,560
two two one three zero three digits

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,140
three one three zero yes

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,200
three one

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,680
two one two yes one two three one three

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,920
two one three two three one zero two

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,540
three zero uh-huh

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:46,740
what else ten zero two one zero

35
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:48,540
is that it anymore three two zero

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,700
I think that's it

37
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,259
and we need to return this in assorted

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,920
right we need to solve this number so

39
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,920
from a small list

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,320
okay so I'm not going to do uh what are

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:08,039
your approaches so I give you a few uh

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:11,220
integers how do we prove it one two zero

43
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,860
okay one two zero that's good one zero

44
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,200
zero three zero zero two zero zero one

45
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,060
zero so that's gonna be money so what's

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,000
your sauce so we want to find out the

47
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,099
three digit so here obviously that could

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,540
be more than three digit and each digit

49
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,580
could be duplicated it could be a

50
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,959
duplicate uh digit so what's your

51
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,700
approach here uh just have a lot of so I

52
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,540
just look for the even numbers

53
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,000
even number sorry

54
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,700
two one three there there's two zero

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,340
zero Advent even number

56
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,220
but how do you know is it even lower we

57
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,780
check we divided by two I just know it

58
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:55,440
three Force wow we check every numbers

59
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,560
we check every possible three digit

60
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,599
numbers check every

61
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,599
three digit number huh

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,819
what do you mean by check every three

63
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,280
digit number so what do you mean here

64
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,400
make all the three digit numbers you can

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,379
make from here right yeah yeah that's

66
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,140
one way what's the most easier way to do

67
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,300
that you will fight close to that check

68
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,459
every no no starting is the last step

69
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,260
check every three digit number okay I'm

70
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,560
going to read it several times until you

71
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,080
figure out every three digit number

72
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,879
every three digit number

73
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,500
every three digit number how many three

74
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,500
digit number how many students

75
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,940
how do we prove Max yeah it's messed but

76
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,920
okay so can you give me a few three

77
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:49,500
teaching numbers six four two okay

78
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,980
one zero two one zero two four six three

79
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,519
okay so how many three digit numbers 899

80
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,659
how do you get it because 999 and a

81
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,299
hundred

82
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,400
nine nine nine and 100. I'm Gonna Leave

83
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,700
it okay check every three digit number

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,580
and then just do one zero zero one zero

85
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,340
one and do it check every three digit

86
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:15,060
number let two ways huh one way is that

87
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,120
true false they are n digit here I pick

88
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:22,199
three digits out of it so this

89
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,450
permutation right commutation pn3

90
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:29,079
permutation with the sequence right

91
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,079
[Music]

92
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,080
good point yes let your mentioned you're

93
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,240
mentioning a very good point no just uh

94
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,460
this is unique right but it has to be

95
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,180
started there are two ways one way is oh

96
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,940
typing into the input to do this

97
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,919
permutation and digit and digit picking

98
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,020
three digit dollar permutation we know

99
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,020
how to permutate right

100
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,020
foreign

101
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,460
we mentioned that ether to a stop

102
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,139
permutation right communication that

103
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,800
will give us the actual communication

104
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,960
once we have a permutation land we just

105
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,759
haven't checked is

106
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,500
zero and if it's an even number if it's

107
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,900
even number we add it to the answer and

108
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,360
we sort it that's one way the other way

109
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,280
is there are limited number of three

110
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,780
digit numbers so we just go through this

111
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,940
from 100 to 999 step two and once we

112
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,520
have for example like a hundred we just

113
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,780
check this 100 if it can be made from

114
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,080
this input

115
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:38,460
makes sense so here we just have to

116
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,740
check how many even numbers 999 minus a

117
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,500
hundred all right divided by two roughly

118
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,440
this number right

119
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:50,039
899 yeah am I right 899 divided by two

120
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,600
okay okay so just add a ground which one

121
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,060
is more efficient which method is more

122
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,699
efficient the one over there this one is

123
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,740
okay why

124
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,940
any any thoughts yes this one is more

125
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,860
efficient why

126
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,680
um because

127
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,900
it's limited so yeah it's limited and

128
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,660
then when we're checking is the because

129
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,180
it's so big easy yeah two approach right

130
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,860
oh yeah the full permutation yeah okay

131
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,139
so I'm going to write it okay and then

132
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,699
you tell me the complexity

133
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:22,440
Define of death five

134
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:26,100
okay so this is the array of digits okay

135
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,259
so digit we want to count how many

136
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,660
digits per digit right how many

137
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:34,440
frequency the frequency per digit so we

138
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,780
use the counter right okay so C equals

139
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,720
counter or can you tell me what's this

140
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,940
counter mean counter digit is that

141
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,800
dictionary the Additionally the keys

142
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,900
will be teaching the value will be there

143
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,460
the value will be how many times they

144
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:54,120
appear right okay so now look for I in

145
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,340
range we start from 100 right this is

146
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,840
the smallest the mean three digit the

147
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,220
last digit will be

148
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:07,259
999 and we step two right actually we

149
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:09,300
step two right okay so 100 102 104 this

150
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,900
is what you mean let's start

151
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,539
okay now this eye what do we do so last

152
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,819
three digits like three two one how do

153
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,400
we get this number how do we get things

154
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,560
from how do we get this number I equals

155
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,819
three to one how do we get one how do we

156
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,580
get two how do we get three 321 is

157
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:31,380
okay so this one is

158
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,740
321 more than 10.

159
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,240
10 10 yes what 10 right modular ten that

160
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,900
would be equal one okay so how about

161
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,300
this one hundred

162
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:45,720
is it Mother Earth

163
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:49,259
321 divided by 100 that give us three

164
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,180
okay and how about this one two how do

165
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,319
you get it how about we can read number

166
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,680
one

167
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,020
how do we can do the one shift but if

168
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,759
this is not binary this is the base ten

169
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,160
and

170
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,520
focal point yeah we can shift it in base

171
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,520
ten

172
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,759
divided by 10 okay so we divided by 10

173
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,199
here

174
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,199
and how do we get these two

175
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,199
we subtract 30. it's a fair 10.

176
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,099
yeah

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,139
we are looking for a 10 a hundred this

178
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:27,960
is because the number system we're using

179
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,120
is base time right am I right it's based

180
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,500
on a decimal right this is what we call

181
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,500
a decimal

182
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:37,140
because it is base 10 binary phase two

183
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,820
okay and we also talk about phase 16

184
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,599
what's that

185
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:47,240
hexic hexic

186
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:51,959
okay what's this mean Phase 10 0 1 2 3 4

187
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:58,279
5 6 7 8 9 and what's next

188
00:08:51,959 --> 00:09:02,279
based her base 16 a b c d e f okay

189
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:05,040
16. okay so for example let's ask what's

190
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:10,100
this number in base 16.

191
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:13,740
look f is 15 right 10 11 12 13 14 15 15

192
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:19,320
and 15. so what's this this is base 16

193
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:21,560
16. times 16. plus 15. so what's this

194
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,560
number

195
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,940
one times

196
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,459
10 to the power of 2 plus 2 times 10 to

197
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,640
the power 1 plus 3 times 10 to the power

198
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:42,600
zero so it's one hundred twenty three

199
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,740
okay so here 15 times 6 base 16 right by

200
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,320
16.

201
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,600
to the power one plus

202
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,620
you get that from here wow we're done

203
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:56,220
255 yes because why why this is equals

204
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:59,519
to 100 but in base 16 minus one right

205
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,560
base 16. all right because look if I

206
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,680
adding one here

207
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,560
you carry it over right F becomes yellow

208
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:11,760
f plus one becomes zero carry over 100

209
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:16,980
100 what's this in space 16 1 times 16

210
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:19,320
to the power of 2 256 minus 1 255. okay

211
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,760
this is all connected right okay so we

212
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,360
go through these numbers all right so

213
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,480
now let's read things so the if this

214
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,760
activity number is ABC okay look this is

215
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,100
teaching I put a horizontal line above

216
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,420
it it means that ABC

217
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:39,540
in this is a times 100 plus b times ten

218
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:43,200
plus C okay ABC I put a horizontal line

219
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:46,920
above it even slide so a equals I

220
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,440
divided by a hundred right b equals I

221
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:54,180
divided by ten

222
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:57,560
modulus 10 right C equals I mod equals

223
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,180
10. I only go to the three digit ABC

224
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,240
we want to find out if these three

225
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,160
digits can be made from the digit right

226
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,680
so we use the color we can do this if

227
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:14,540
counter

228
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:14,540
a b c e smaller or equal length BC right

229
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,620
look at this is a very important look if

230
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,600
this counter if the three digits the

231
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,579
frequency is smaller or equal than the

232
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,779
DC then we answer with answer answer

233
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:29,579
here okay answer always answer dot of

234
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,060
hand

235
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,060
okay

236
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,640
and then return answer

237
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,399
okay so can you tell me why we don't

238
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,459
need to sort the array here so the

239
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,620
numbers because we're going 100 to 19.

240
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:49,079
well done okay you're listening yes okay

241
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,120
the second question is why do we don't

242
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,519
check if it's an even number here it

243
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,440
says two two yeah step two so it's a

244
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,560
hundred a hundred two a hundred four it

245
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,500
skips the odd number right okay so

246
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,839
that's very good the times if we ignore

247
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,760
this one right if we ignore this one

248
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,040
if we don't consider this one what's the

249
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,399
tangent brexit

250
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,200
Owen I won oh one yeah oh and because

251
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,420
this is a constant Loop

252
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,360
and then

253
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,040
then Concepts this one

254
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,320
we treat it as constant right because

255
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,260
comparing this is the limited right and

256
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,180
this is uh given as uh we just don't

257
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,860
consider that but if we consider this

258
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,500
one this is not a one language because

259
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,000
the digit could be n right there could

260
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,640
be end this is when we need to go

261
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,760
through this n digit

262
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,560
another way I as I was saying before yes

263
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,360
this is going to be the checking this

264
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,339
background right and if we given this

265
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,459
number digit

266
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,620
so we actually need to permutate

267
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:53,160
all right tell me if you like n digits

268
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:56,820
per me like three digit out of n what

269
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:59,459
C and three cn3 picking two airports out

270
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,959
of an apple without orders this is with

271
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:04,740
order so this is equal C and three times

272
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,620
p33 okay

273
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:10,320
so how do we permutate we can deficit

274
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,500
profession but I leave it to the next

275
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,899
few lessons but another way is to use

276
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:20,579
the function tool from ether to us

277
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:23,399
ing power

278
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:25,320
commutation right permutation one two

279
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,720
there are two letters how many ways do

280
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,680
we permutated

281
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,079
one two three how many ways to

282
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,360
determines I did one two three two six

283
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,060
yeah yeah this is full permutation right

284
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,880
one two three one three two two one

285
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,920
three two three one three one two three

286
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,040
two one right and of course the first

287
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,260
one has 10 Choice second one has M minus

288
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,120
one choice the third one has a minus two

289
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,920
Choice the last one has one choice

290
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,079
what's this

291
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,120
n times n minus one times n minus so

292
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,880
three times two one

293
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,680
what's this

294
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,760
bacteria bacteria

295
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,600
okay

296
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,720
so we we use this function right

297
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,880
now then we can do this four a b c

298
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,660
commutative three digits right the

299
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,940
hundreds the tens the ones in

300
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,240
permutation

301
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,540
digit all right I want the

302
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,160
pick three digits out of the digits a b

303
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,040
c three digit and then I just have to

304
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,540
check look if a is not equal to zero

305
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,139
right we don't have a leading zero here

306
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:35,040
right and if C

307
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:37,320
and one is still so this means that if

308
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,420
it's an even number answer because it

309
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,720
could contain the duplicate so answer we

310
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,500
need to put it as a set so answer dot

311
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,339
add

312
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:51,260
what a times a hundred plus b times ten

313
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:55,860
plus C right and then return

314
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:57,839
salty we sorted the answer okay

315
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,530
what's the time complexity

316
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,850
um

317
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,850
[Music]

318
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:15,779
number of permutation space complexity

319
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,540
again why because each number could be a

320
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:21,300
even number right 246 then how many

321
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:24,300
possibilities two four six if the given

322
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,940
numbers are 246. how many

323
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,339
six yeah because look you can do any

324
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,320
communication and it says so now in the

325
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:33,720
worst case the phase complexity is this

326
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,360
the time complexity is this okay and

327
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,320
also don't forget we have to sort it the

328
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,940
time complexity is pn3 plus sorting if

329
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,899
like an animal we want to sort it how

330
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,899
what's the time the black stick

331
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:54,540
this is n Times log

332
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,480
p and three okay so this is the time

333
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,000
complexity okay yeah okay so what have

334
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,720
you learned today about

335
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,720
finding three digits

336
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,779
three digit uh

337
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:12,300
we are given a list of digits we want to

338
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,820
find out a three or the three digit even

339
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,399
numbers no leaving zeros the result has

340
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:21,800
to be in uh increasing order so okay

341
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,800
right and how many ways we can do it

342
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,019
odd numbers so it's and it's already

343
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:59,279
sorted as we're going up so if you go

344
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:01,620
100 100 102 up to 998 and then we find

345
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,779
out the ABC so we teach it and we check

346
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,160
if these three digits can be made from

347
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,959
the original digital then we use the

348
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,319
counter right we can directly compare

349
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,760
two counter to see if a counter is

350
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,040
included in another account right

351
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,780
smaller or equal and C if it's a smaller

352
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,699
in currency it means that the original

353
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,040
fitted

354
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:23,459
we can use the original digit to make

355
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,380
this uh I this I digit okay with the I

356
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,940
predicted ABC okay that's it for today

357
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:31,279
bye bye bye bye

358
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,279
