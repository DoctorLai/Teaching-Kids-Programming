1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,749

hello hello everyone ryan

2
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:05,759

 

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,950

okay so today we're going to talk about

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:08,960
okay so today we're going to talk about
 

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,070
okay so today we're going to talk about
the another data structures so

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
the another data structures so
 

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,990
the another data structures so
can you tell me what have you what kind

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
can you tell me what have you what kind
 

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,430
can you tell me what have you what kind
of data structure have you learned in

10
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
of data structure have you learned in
 

11
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,349
of data structure have you learned in
the past

12
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
the past
 

13
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,630
the past
remember we got a queue yeah and

14
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,640
remember we got a queue yeah and
 

15
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,670
remember we got a queue yeah and
towers and stack yeah

16
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680
towers and stack yeah
 

17
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,710
towers and stack yeah
and at least as well yeah at least yeah

18
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:26,720
and at least as well yeah at least yeah
 

19
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,669
and at least as well yeah at least yeah
they both these three kinds of things

20
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
they both these three kinds of things
 

21
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,310
they both these three kinds of things
can

22
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
can
 

23
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,549
can
all be represented in python using this

24
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
all be represented in python using this
 

25
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:33,590
all be represented in python using this
bracket yeah

26
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
bracket yeah
 

27
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,510
bracket yeah
yeah it's a square bracket this is

28
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
yeah it's a square bracket this is
 

29
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,110
yeah it's a square bracket this is
square breaking right

30
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
square breaking right
 

31
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,150
square breaking right
yeah okay so today we're going to add

32
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
yeah okay so today we're going to add
 

33
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,430
yeah okay so today we're going to add
another data structure so remind me what

34
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
another data structure so remind me what
 

35
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,590
another data structure so remind me what
is data structure

36
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
is data structure
 

37
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,630
is data structure
it's the structures to hold data yeah so

38
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
it's the structures to hold data yeah so
 

39
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,670
it's the structures to hold data yeah so
we need to

40
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
we need to
 

41
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,069
we need to
let computer to hold data so then the

42
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
let computer to hold data so then the
 

43
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,750
let computer to hold data so then the
computer can process the data

44
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
computer can process the data
 

45
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,029
computer can process the data
right yes so we're going to

46
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039
right yes so we're going to
 

47
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,229
right yes so we're going to
add another data structure called set

48
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
add another data structure called set
 

49
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,990
add another data structure called set
so can you tell me where it's set

50
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000

 

51
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,030

up no setup okay set

52
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
up no setup okay set
 

53
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,350
up no setup okay set
is a collection but only

54
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
is a collection but only
 

55
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,510
is a collection but only
it's a collection but only with the

56
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
it's a collection but only with the
 

57
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,350
it's a collection but only with the
unique data

58
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
unique data
 

59
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,310
unique data
okay do you understand unique data so

60
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
okay do you understand unique data so
 

61
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,830
okay do you understand unique data so
for example like

62
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
for example like
 

63
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,789
for example like
okay so if i if there's a bunch of data

64
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
okay so if i if there's a bunch of data
 

65
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,190
okay so if i if there's a bunch of data
one

66
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
one
 

67
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,390
one
one two three four four okay

68
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
one two three four four okay
 

69
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,670
one two three four four okay
so look there are duplicate elements yes

70
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
so look there are duplicate elements yes
 

71
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,870
so look there are duplicate elements yes
duplicate elements ryan you play

72
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
duplicate elements ryan you play
 

73
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,469
duplicate elements ryan you play
there are two fours two ones so this is

74
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
there are two fours two ones so this is
 

75
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,030
there are two fours two ones so this is
uh

76
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
uh
 

77
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,749
uh
you can have a list of that but the set

78
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
you can have a list of that but the set
 

79
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,069
you can have a list of that but the set
we

80
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
we
 

81
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,550
we
only if we convert it into a set it will

82
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
only if we convert it into a set it will
 

83
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,429
only if we convert it into a set it will
only contain

84
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
only contain
 

85
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,710
only contain
one two three four okay

86
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
one two three four okay
 

87
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,870
one two three four okay
they understand because because these

88
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
they understand because because these
 

89
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,710
they understand because because these
are the unique

90
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
are the unique
 

91
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,990
are the unique
elements so how can we do this look

92
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
elements so how can we do this look
 

93
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,350
elements so how can we do this look
so look if we have a numbers

94
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
so look if we have a numbers
 

95
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,870
so look if we have a numbers
nums yeah equals

96
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
nums yeah equals
 

97
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,990
nums yeah equals
we're given a list okay this one

98
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
we're given a list okay this one
 

99
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,270
we're given a list okay this one
two two three three

100
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
two two three three
 

101
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,990
two two three three
okay that's it and now we're converting

102
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
okay that's it and now we're converting
 

103
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,790
okay that's it and now we're converting
it to set

104
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
it to set
 

105
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,470
it to set
so how can we do it we can do this uh

106
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
so how can we do it we can do this uh
 

107
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,990
so how can we do it we can do this uh
let's call it n okay and equal

108
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
let's call it n okay and equal
 

109
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,229
let's call it n okay and equal
set we use this keyword set

110
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
set we use this keyword set
 

111
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,710
set we use this keyword set
and bracket yeah you can take you can

112
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
and bracket yeah you can take you can
 

113
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,110
and bracket yeah you can take you can
create the empty set by doing this

114
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
create the empty set by doing this
 

115
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,110
create the empty set by doing this
right you can create an empty set by

116
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
right you can create an empty set by
 

117
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,190
right you can create an empty set by
doing that or you can take a parameter

118
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
doing that or you can take a parameter
 

119
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,070
doing that or you can take a parameter
with the list

120
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
with the list
 

121
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,670
with the list
yeah numbers so what do you think will

122
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
yeah numbers so what do you think will
 

123
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,110
yeah numbers so what do you think will
happen

124
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
happen
 

125
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,390
happen
now the end we are content

126
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
now the end we are content
 

127
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,509
now the end we are content
we're content one

128
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
we're content one
 

129
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,550
we're content one
two and three okay and the set

130
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
two and three okay and the set
 

131
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,790
two and three okay and the set
is an order it means that it's just a

132
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
is an order it means that it's just a
 

133
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,150
is an order it means that it's just a
collection and you don't know which

134
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
collection and you don't know which
 

135
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,869
collection and you don't know which
comes first

136
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
comes first
 

137
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,309
comes first
but it tells you those the uh elements

138
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
but it tells you those the uh elements
 

139
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,670
but it tells you those the uh elements
which are unique okay

140
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680

 

141
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,229

okay so now look we can do this

142
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
okay so now look we can do this
 

143
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,509
okay so now look we can do this
it's simple yeah yeah okay so we let's

144
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
it's simple yeah yeah okay so we let's
 

145
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,149
it's simple yeah yeah okay so we let's
call let's introduce another graph

146
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
call let's introduce another graph
 

147
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,550
call let's introduce another graph
called

148
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
called
 

149
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,430
called
van graff this is interesting van graff

150
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
van graff this is interesting van graff
 

151
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,550
van graff this is interesting van graff
okay so basically let's say

152
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
okay so basically let's say
 

153
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,550
okay so basically let's say
we have a collection here a

154
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
we have a collection here a
 

155
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,309
we have a collection here a
okay yeah collection and here we have

156
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
okay yeah collection and here we have
 

157
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,350
okay yeah collection and here we have
another connection

158
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
another connection
 

159
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,110
another connection
b okay so this connection

160
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
b okay so this connection
 

161
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,149
b okay so this connection
we can call it uh

162
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
we can call it uh
 

163
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,390
we can call it uh
we assume it's unique so we can use the

164
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
we assume it's unique so we can use the
 

165
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,509
we assume it's unique so we can use the
set a set b

166
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
set a set b
 

167
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,270
set a set b
set okay so now a sub b say

168
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
set okay so now a sub b say
 

169
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,430
set okay so now a sub b say
so a let's let's use this one

170
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
so a let's let's use this one
 

171
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,949
so a let's let's use this one
a equals set okay i can't see

172
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
a equals set okay i can't see
 

173
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,390
a equals set okay i can't see
a a is a set okay a is a sense

174
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400

 

175
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,869

okay b equals an asset

176
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
okay b equals an asset
 

177
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,789
okay b equals an asset
okay so now what's this part

178
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
okay so now what's this part
 

179
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,830
okay so now what's this part
what's this fit a

180
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
what's this fit a
 

181
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,789
what's this fit a
and b both a and b so the elements both

182
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
and b both a and b so the elements both
 

183
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,110
and b both a and b so the elements both
in

184
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
in
 

185
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,550
in
a and b all right so we can use this a

186
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
a and b all right so we can use this a
 

187
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,909
a and b all right so we can use this a
and b this will give

188
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
and b this will give
 

189
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,550
and b this will give
me these will give these elements here

190
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
me these will give these elements here
 

191
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,110
me these will give these elements here
right

192
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
right
 

193
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,270
right
so you all you can write it this way a

194
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
so you all you can write it this way a
 

195
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,070
so you all you can write it this way a
the intersect

196
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
the intersect
 

197
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,270
the intersect
intercept b okay

198
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
intercept b okay
 

199
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,430
intercept b okay
a and b so it will be you will return

200
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
a and b so it will be you will return
 

201
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,030
a and b so it will be you will return
this part so for example a

202
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
this part so for example a
 

203
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,629
this part so for example a
is one two three and b is two

204
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
is one two three and b is two
 

205
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,189
is one two three and b is two
three four a and b will return two and

206
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
three four a and b will return two and
 

207
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,189
three four a and b will return two and
three yes because two and three appear

208
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
three yes because two and three appear
 

209
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,310
three yes because two and three appear
in first one okay yeah

210
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
in first one okay yeah
 

211
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,909
in first one okay yeah
yeah and how about all together so

212
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
yeah and how about all together so
 

213
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,830
yeah and how about all together so
a plus b not plus b actually a

214
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
a plus b not plus b actually a
 

215
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,270
a plus b not plus b actually a
or b okay it's all single a or b

216
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
or b okay it's all single a or b
 

217
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,990
or b okay it's all single a or b
a dot is the same as these two are the

218
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
a dot is the same as these two are the
 

219
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,950
a dot is the same as these two are the
same okay

220
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
same okay
 

221
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,670
same okay
eight of union what's the meaning of

222
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
eight of union what's the meaning of
 

223
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,990
eight of union what's the meaning of
union

224
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
union
 

225
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,350
union
unions union i union u so we put it

226
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
unions union i union u so we put it
 

227
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,390
unions union i union u so we put it
together so

228
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
together so
 

229
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,590
together so
look a b union together that would be

230
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
look a b union together that would be
 

231
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,950
look a b union together that would be
what's the answer of a union b

232
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
what's the answer of a union b
 

233
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,310
what's the answer of a union b
a or b what's it it'll be

234
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
a or b what's it it'll be
 

235
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,710
a or b what's it it'll be
one two three four okay so all elements

236
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
one two three four okay so all elements
 

237
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:30,629
one two three four okay so all elements
from

238
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639

 

239
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,550

how about i want the elements not in

240
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
how about i want the elements not in
 

241
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,189
how about i want the elements not in
not in common so it's this bit only

242
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
not in common so it's this bit only
 

243
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,070
not in common so it's this bit only
speed

244
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
speed
 

245
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,189
speed
this bit so that we call it what we call

246
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
this bit so that we call it what we call
 

247
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:41,430
this bit so that we call it what we call
it

248
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
it
 

249
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,270
it
a plus b

250
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
a plus b
 

251
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,950
a plus b
now a is too same

252
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
now a is too same
 

253
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,950
now a is too same
so we use this uh

254
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
so we use this uh
 

255
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,070
so we use this uh
symmetric difference okay symmetric or

256
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
symmetric difference okay symmetric or
 

257
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,550
symmetric difference okay symmetric or
just

258
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
just
 

259
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,150
just
symmetric so maybe uh

260
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
symmetric so maybe uh
 

261
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,950
symmetric so maybe uh
so how do we do this is a dot symmetric

262
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
so how do we do this is a dot symmetric
 

263
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,950
so how do we do this is a dot symmetric
uh right difference

264
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
uh right difference
 

265
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,510
uh right difference
okay b i don't know how to spell it but

266
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
okay b i don't know how to spell it but
 

267
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,590
okay b i don't know how to spell it but
you know these meanings

268
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
you know these meanings
 

269
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,790
you know these meanings
a uh we call is exclusive so this will

270
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
a uh we call is exclusive so this will
 

271
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,510
a uh we call is exclusive so this will
be 10

272
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
be 10
 

273
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,550
be 10
on the side no no you will no

274
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
on the side no no you will no
 

275
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,110
on the side no no you will no
it will return all elements which are

276
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
it will return all elements which are
 

277
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,790
it will return all elements which are
not in common in both sets

278
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
not in common in both sets
 

279
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,230
not in common in both sets
so you will return one one and four

280
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
so you will return one one and four
 

281
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,629
so you will return one one and four
okay one and four okay

282
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
okay one and four okay
 

283
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,990
okay one and four okay
how about a

284
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
how about a
 

285
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,390
how about a
minus b can you tell me what y is a

286
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
minus b can you tell me what y is a
 

287
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,270
minus b can you tell me what y is a
minus b

288
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280

 

289
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,189

so it's in

290
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199

 

291
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,790

it's in set a but it's not in set b

292
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
it's in set a but it's not in set b
 

293
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,990
it's in set a but it's not in set b
all right one yes

294
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
all right one yes
 

295
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,870
all right one yes
so you return one okay that's the return

296
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
so you return one okay that's the return
 

297
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,830
so you return one okay that's the return
one

298
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
one
 

299
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,749
one
and the the opposite will be the same

300
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
and the the opposite will be the same
 

301
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,110
and the the opposite will be the same
okay so we can do this a

302
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
okay so we can do this a
 

303
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,390
okay so we can do this a
smaller or equal b we can say if a

304
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
smaller or equal b we can say if a
 

305
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,670
smaller or equal b we can say if a
is a subset of b okay

306
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
is a subset of b okay
 

307
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,870
is a subset of b okay
or b if it's a subset of a

308
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
or b if it's a subset of a
 

309
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,790
or b if it's a subset of a
look at any set is a subset of itself

310
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
look at any set is a subset of itself
 

311
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,309
look at any set is a subset of itself
okay because there's an equal right

312
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
okay because there's an equal right
 

313
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,029
okay because there's an equal right
yeah so if we remove the equal then you

314
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
yeah so if we remove the equal then you
 

315
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,550
yeah so if we remove the equal then you
will exclude the equal

316
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
will exclude the equal
 

317
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,589
will exclude the equal
case which is that is a strictly subset

318
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
case which is that is a strictly subset
 

319
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,189
case which is that is a strictly subset
of another one

320
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
of another one
 

321
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,430
of another one
so how about if we want to check if two

322
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
so how about if we want to check if two
 

323
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,790
so how about if we want to check if two
sets have something in common

324
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800

 

325
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,909

yeah what what do you know how to know

326
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
yeah what what do you know how to know
 

327
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,990
yeah what what do you know how to know
if there are two sets have something in

328
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
if there are two sets have something in
 

329
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,110
if there are two sets have something in
common

330
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
common
 

331
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,150
common
so look we can use this one right a and

332
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
so look we can use this one right a and
 

333
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,390
so look we can use this one right a and
b

334
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
b
 

335
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,189
b
and we can check the lens yeah that's

336
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
and we can check the lens yeah that's
 

337
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:49,749
and we can check the lens yeah that's
one way

338
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
one way
 

339
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,110
one way
the other way would be a dot

340
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
the other way would be a dot
 

341
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,270
the other way would be a dot
is disjoint

342
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280

 

343
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,110

b okay if there's anything in common

344
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
b okay if there's anything in common
 

345
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,550
b okay if there's anything in common
okay so this is the set data structure

346
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
okay so this is the set data structure
 

347
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,589
okay so this is the set data structure
and we can add and remove it

348
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
and we can add and remove it
 

349
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,390
and we can add and remove it
so for example we can do this we have

350
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
so for example we can do this we have
 

351
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,029
so for example we can do this we have
this set

352
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
this set
 

353
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,110
this set
we can say a dot at

354
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
we can say a dot at
 

355
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,790
we can say a dot at
another one element like five

356
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
another one element like five
 

357
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,629
another one element like five
after this a we have five okay

358
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
after this a we have five okay
 

359
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,189
after this a we have five okay
here we go and we can remove it a top

360
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
here we go and we can remove it a top
 

361
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,110
here we go and we can remove it a top
remove

362
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
remove
 

363
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,350
remove
remove five then the fly will be removed

364
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
remove five then the fly will be removed
 

365
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,029
remove five then the fly will be removed
okay okay do you understand

366
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
okay okay do you understand
 

367
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,389
okay okay do you understand
okay so so this is the basic uh

368
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
okay so so this is the basic uh
 

369
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,790
okay so so this is the basic uh
operation of using how how we use the

370
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
operation of using how how we use the
 

371
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,430
operation of using how how we use the
set in the python

372
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
set in the python
 

373
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,470
set in the python
it is actually very powerful okay

374
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
it is actually very powerful okay
 

375
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,829
it is actually very powerful okay
so how about we know we if we want to

376
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839
so how about we know we if we want to
 

377
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,910
so how about we know we if we want to
if okay so let's let's

378
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
if okay so let's let's
 

379
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,829
if okay so let's let's
let's do this okay

380
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839

 

381
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,110

if i give you a string if i give you a

382
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
if i give you a string if i give you a
 

383
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,790
if i give you a string if i give you a
string

384
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
string
 

385
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,509
string
a b c you need to return

386
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
a b c you need to return
 

387
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,949
a b c you need to return
return true because

388
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
return true because
 

389
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,350
return true because
only numbers all the characters in the

390
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
only numbers all the characters in the
 

391
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,110
only numbers all the characters in the
string are unique

392
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
string are unique
 

393
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,150
string are unique
okay but if it is a a

394
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
okay but if it is a a
 

395
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,910
okay but if it is a a
b c you need to return first

396
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
b c you need to return first
 

397
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,829
b c you need to return first
do you understand because the a is not

398
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
do you understand because the a is not
 

399
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,710
do you understand because the a is not
unique it appears twice

400
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
unique it appears twice
 

401
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,310
unique it appears twice
got it say if it it try

402
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
got it say if it it try
 

403
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,990
got it say if it it try
yes false yes yes so how do we do

404
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
yes false yes yes so how do we do
 

405
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,710
yes false yes yes so how do we do
it how do we how do we use the set to

406
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
it how do we how do we use the set to
 

407
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,590
it how do we how do we use the set to
define

408
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
define
 

409
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,030
define
to define it that

410
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
to define it that
 

411
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,990
to define it that
yeah i know i know death that's

412
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
yeah i know i know death that's
 

413
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,550
yeah i know i know death that's
definitely

414
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
definitely
 

415
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,240
definitely
let's write it okay it's fine

416
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,250

 

417
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:58,550

[Music]

418
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:58,560

 

419
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,070

don't worry you got plenty to turn

420
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
don't worry you got plenty to turn
 

421
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,829
don't worry you got plenty to turn
afterwards okay listen carefully and

422
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
afterwards okay listen carefully and
 

423
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,710
afterwards okay listen carefully and
then you write it

424
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
then you write it
 

425
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,829
then you write it
practice define how to record the

426
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
practice define how to record the
 

427
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,350
practice define how to record the
function

428
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
function
 

429
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,430
function
then graph set unique let's say unique

430
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
then graph set unique let's say unique
 

431
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,710
then graph set unique let's say unique
you and iq you need a string okay a

432
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
you and iq you need a string okay a
 

433
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,670
you and iq you need a string okay a
string and what's

434
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
string and what's
 

435
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,190
string and what's
missing here yeah that's the answer

436
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
missing here yeah that's the answer
 

437
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,190
missing here yeah that's the answer
you always get it right right

438
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
you always get it right right
 

439
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,710
you always get it right right
so so how do we do it we can

440
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
so so how do we do it we can
 

441
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,470
so so how do we do it we can
we can have different ways of

442
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
we can have different ways of
 

443
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,750
we can have different ways of
implementing

444
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
implementing
 

445
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,910
implementing
for example we can do this okay the

446
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
for example we can do this okay the
 

447
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,110
for example we can do this okay the
easiest way

448
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
easiest way
 

449
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,150
easiest way
the most intuitive way would be i create

450
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
the most intuitive way would be i create
 

451
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,509
the most intuitive way would be i create
a set first okay

452
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
a set first okay
 

453
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,670
a set first okay
let's go create uh uh

454
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
let's go create uh uh
 

455
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,870
let's go create uh uh
let's let's call it uh

456
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
let's let's call it uh
 

457
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,110
let's let's call it uh
what the

458
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120

 

459
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,870

uh st okay

460
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
uh st okay
 

461
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,110
uh st okay
set it's uh equal set we create a set

462
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
set it's uh equal set we create a set
 

463
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,310
set it's uh equal set we create a set
okay

464
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320

 

465
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,030

now what do we do we can iterate the

466
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
now what do we do we can iterate the
 

467
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,670
now what do we do we can iterate the
function

468
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
function
 

469
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,430
function
for for i

470
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
for for i
 

471
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,990
for for i
in s

472
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000

 

473
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,430

okay then we need to do this if

474
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
okay then we need to do this if
 

475
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,350
okay then we need to do this if
i is

476
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
i is
 

477
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,829
i is
so how do we check if a set has some

478
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
so how do we check if a set has some
 

479
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,190
so how do we check if a set has some
some uh

480
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
some uh
 

481
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,350
some uh
we can use this right if i in ins

482
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
we can use this right if i in ins
 

483
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,269
we can use this right if i in ins
plane inset right

484
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
plane inset right
 

485
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,630
plane inset right
can we use this if i insert then we

486
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
can we use this if i insert then we
 

487
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,949
can we use this if i insert then we
return false

488
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
return false
 

489
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,230
return false
otherwise i will place the st

490
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
otherwise i will place the st
 

491
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,670
otherwise i will place the st
i will put it at i

492
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
i will put it at i
 

493
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,509
i will put it at i
and otherwise i will return true that's

494
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
and otherwise i will return true that's
 

495
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,949
and otherwise i will return true that's
one way of doing it okay

496
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959

 

497
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,590

let's see if it works okay yes let's see

498
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
let's see if it works okay yes let's see
 

499
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,389
let's see if it works okay yes let's see
if it works

500
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
if it works
 

501
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,670
if it works
wait be quiet

502

yeah he was walking

504
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279

 

505
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,389

what daddy

506
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
what daddy
 

507
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,389
what daddy
yes when it enter look what happens

508
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:16,399
yes when it enter look what happens
 

509
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:28,150
yes when it enter look what happens
okay where is it space

510
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160

 

511
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,710

oh yeah i've got something yeah and if

512
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
oh yeah i've got something yeah and if
 

513
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,470
oh yeah i've got something yeah and if
you've got something

514
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
you've got something
 

515
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,069
you've got something
okay so this is one way of doing it

516
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
okay so this is one way of doing it
 

517
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,550
okay so this is one way of doing it
we're creating a set look we check if

518
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
we're creating a set look we check if
 

519
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,829
we're creating a set look we check if
this integer

520
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
this integer
 

521
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,069
this integer
uh you know if the character is already

522
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
uh you know if the character is already
 

523
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,350
uh you know if the character is already
in the set if it's

524
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
in the set if it's
 

525
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,949
in the set if it's
ignoring the same i would determine for

526
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
ignoring the same i would determine for
 

527
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,710
ignoring the same i would determine for
otherwise we put it in the set

528
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
otherwise we put it in the set
 

529
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,470
otherwise we put it in the set
and so to get it yeah so this look

530
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
and so to get it yeah so this look
 

531
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,629
and so to get it yeah so this look
a b c that will return true right

532
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
a b c that will return true right
 

533
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,910
a b c that will return true right
because every time it's

534
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
because every time it's
 

535
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,550
because every time it's
it's only appearing once but aadc look

536
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
it's only appearing once but aadc look
 

537
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,470
it's only appearing once but aadc look
what happened with aadc

538
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
what happened with aadc
 

539
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,590
what happened with aadc
a it's not in the set

540
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
a it's not in the set
 

541
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,670
a it's not in the set
i put it here but the next one is

542
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
i put it here but the next one is
 

543
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,509
i put it here but the next one is
already in the set we already put it in

544
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
already in the set we already put it in
 

545
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,949
already in the set we already put it in
a set then we determine first

546
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
a set then we determine first
 

547
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,310
a set then we determine first
do you get it okay how about the other

548
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
do you get it okay how about the other
 

549
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,870
do you get it okay how about the other
way

550
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
way
 

551
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,949
way
we take these we take the whole string

552
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
we take these we take the whole string
 

553
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,190
we take these we take the whole string
and put and and build a set

554
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
and put and and build a set
 

555
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,190
and put and and build a set
and then check the size if it's the same

556
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
and then check the size if it's the same
 

557
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,230
and then check the size if it's the same
as the swing size

558
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
as the swing size
 

559
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,310
as the swing size
so it will be even simpler so how do we

560
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
so it will be even simpler so how do we
 

561
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,430
so it will be even simpler so how do we
do it

562
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
do it
 

563
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,389
do it
yeah we can do this this is the same

564
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
yeah we can do this this is the same
 

565
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,470
yeah we can do this this is the same
unique

566
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,480

 

567
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,710

so we build a set we build the set

568
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
so we build a set we build the set
 

569
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,629
so we build a set we build the set
and we we need to take we need to

570
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
and we we need to take we need to
 

571
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,990
and we we need to take we need to
take the s build it okay

572
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
take the s build it okay
 

573
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,110
take the s build it okay
and then how do we do it we pretend

574
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
and then how do we do it we pretend
 

575
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,150
and then how do we do it we pretend
we just returned s dot size no no size

576
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
we just returned s dot size no no size
 

577
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,910
we just returned s dot size no no size
length s t equals

578
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
length s t equals
 

579
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,550
length s t equals
length s right do you get it

580
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
length s right do you get it
 

581
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,670
length s right do you get it
look we're building this

582
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
look we're building this
 

583
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,550
look we're building this
if we build a set using this string

584
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
if we build a set using this string
 

585
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,430
if we build a set using this string
using these

586
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
using these
 

587
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,590
using these
characters then the set will have three

588
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
characters then the set will have three
 

589
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,069
characters then the set will have three
sides

590
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
sides
 

591
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,069
sides
three three elements they're unique

592
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
three three elements they're unique
 

593
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,150
three three elements they're unique
right so this is true but these

594
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
right so this is true but these
 

595
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,829
right so this is true but these
if you build a set using these

596
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
if you build a set using these
 

597
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,790
if you build a set using these
characters in the string the set size

598
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
characters in the string the set size
 

599
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,790
characters in the string the set size
will be three but the string side will

600
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
will be three but the string side will
 

601
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,430
will be three but the string side will
be false

602
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
be false
 

603
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,389
be false
they are not equal am i now not equal

604
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
they are not equal am i now not equal
 

605
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,670
they are not equal am i now not equal
eric do you understand so you see

606
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:31,680
eric do you understand so you see
 

607
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,990
eric do you understand so you see
this is not one quicker way of doing

608
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
this is not one quicker way of doing
 

609
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,670
this is not one quicker way of doing
that this is the traditional way of

610
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
that this is the traditional way of
 

611
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,550
that this is the traditional way of
doing that

612
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
doing that
 

613
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,670
doing that
checking checking if they are

614
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
checking checking if they are
 

615
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,509
checking checking if they are
if they are duplicate if this string

616
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:43,519
if they are duplicate if this string
 

617
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:43,990
if they are duplicate if this string
contains

618
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
contains
 

619
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,430
contains
only the unique characters okay

620
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
only the unique characters okay
 

621
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,790
only the unique characters okay
do you get it so which one do you like

622
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
do you get it so which one do you like
 

623
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,509
do you get it so which one do you like
best

624
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
best
 

625
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,300
best
which way do you understand

626
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,310
which way do you understand
