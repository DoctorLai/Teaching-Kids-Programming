1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,200
hi hello mr and mr man

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,920
so look we are given a list of uh sorted

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,759
numbers so these numbers are sorted in

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,519
long descending order ascending yeah

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,839
ascending right yeah

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
so we also return a copy of the squares

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,000
of this at least for example the square

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,640
of each number all right so look this

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,920
one is squares of it which is what 25 25

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,279
and this one four this one

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,440
one

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,000
49 we're done okay but we want to return

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,960
square and sorted as well yeah one for

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,719
25 49. zero

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,840
25

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,360
we're done okay so how can we do it

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,039
simple we're going to square each number

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,360
to the power of two

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,199
to the power thinking of something

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,039
solving yeah we're done sorting yeah so

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,440
we basically we go through each number

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,960
we square it yeah we square it and we

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,600
just sort it yeah

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,559
that's a very obvious way that's very

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,720
obvious look how do we do it

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,720
so we can look at um

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,840
we could

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,640
go

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,360
go on the shops and look for timetables

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,080
and then look at each timetable

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,600
sound on it and then just

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,520
do and sort it

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,600
further okay so you're saying that but

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,840
this timetable could be very big right

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,119
yeah because these numbers are arbitrary

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,040
so

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,479
how can you find it that numbers in the

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,840
time table so

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,840
so we are we're talking we are not

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
talking about a few numbers like in the

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
range right

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,680
yeah

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,079
yeah exactly so and then done

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,799
wow that's an easy question yeah so okay

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,360
so i'm doing a good job square

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,920
so do the math that's why you say mess

47
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,640
and then thought yeah

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,399
okay so two step square and soft okay

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
let's just quickly write it okay so it

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,799
should be very easy i'm definitely not

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,320
done okay okay

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,520
so how let's do this look define

53
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,719
square of list and then we given these

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,880
numbers

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,880
so

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,280
so answer don't attempt

57
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,080
how do we calculate the square how do we

58
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,879
calculate a to the power

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,239
in paisan how do we do this in person a

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,360
times a

61
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,480
we're down n a to the power of a or

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,920
power

63
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,040
a b

64
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,879
power a two f or a star star two yeah

65
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,040
remember this index yeah

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,120
okay so i times i okay let's do it and

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,959
then we just pretend

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,040
sorted

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,200
sorted answer yeah we can do this sort

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,440
of answer or we we can do this answer

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,400
the thought in the front and then we can

72
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,400
answer those are okay okay so the thing

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,519
is that we can we can change this to a

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,920
better syntax yeah better how to do this

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,000
return we can just retain one line yeah

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,200
return salty

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,319
sorted x times x for

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,200
x in numbers right look this is one line

79
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,599
yeah or we can do this another one using

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,360
the map function return sorted

81
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,080
map

82
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,360
but the first function is the map the

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,920
first parameter

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,280
of the map function is the

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,920
the function so we can pass a lambda

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,840
lambda is a short function x x to the

87
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,680
power of two

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,519
and then the second parenthesis

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,879
this is okay right

90
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,040
yes what's the time complexity

91
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,280
and logan we're done because we have n

92
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,799
numbers yes we have numbers yeah sure

93
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,920
okay so

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,920
so we can do in o and term so you owen

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,599
time so how can we do this or when then

96
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,360
the thing is then we

97
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,120
so what's the thing what what the thing

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,280
is that the original is it's already

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,000
sorted yeah it's already sorted so we

100
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,760
want to make use of that look minus five

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,239
what minus two zero one seven right

102
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,720
so we will this is already

103
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,519
yeah so

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,040
can we tell the thing is that the miners

105
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,240
you're not sure which one is bigger

106
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,919
right

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,560
look i am

108
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,639
that one's bigger because i have brains

109
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,639
no no

110
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,280
so because the largest one we can go

111
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
through the largest one to the we can

112
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,919
feel the array this is the answer yeah

113
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,160
this is the answer which is the the the

114
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,919
salty of the from the smallest squares

115
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,520
to the largest square right so this one

116
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,600
should be the the largest one it could

117
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,680
be only two cases either you take this

118
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,919
one or take this one but where here this

119
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,919
is bigger right seven to the power of

120
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,080
two is forty nine two to the power is

121
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,400
twenty five so this is bigger right

122
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,120
yeah so i put it take this i put it here

123
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,520
forty nine i i and and now

124
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,680
minus five and one which one is bigger

125
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,720
come on minus one and five which one is

126
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,080
bigger

127
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,919
to the power of two

128
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,840
[Music]

129
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,080
minus five okay so i take this one and

130
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,880
put it here 25 okay and then here which

131
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,120
one is bigger minus two one minus three

132
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,120
okay

133
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,280
okay so what's the time complexity if

134
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
you look at this way i mean what's the

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,960
term complexity each one

136
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,199
where they're always linear

137
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,360
yeah so which one is bigger the previous

138
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,440
one the saltine oh and again

139
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,400
which one is bigger which one which one

140
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,400
is better

141
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,039
owen or logan which one is better

142
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,800
oh and obviously i have a brain okay

143
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,440
okay let's implement this two-point

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,720
thing okay and a little bit okay come on

145
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,000
and you're definitely gonna give us

146
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:14,110
another

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,110
[Music]

148
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,400
okay now

149
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,520
it was the lens numbs

150
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,759
the left pointer equals zero the right

151
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,800
pointer equals n minus one and we also

152
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,080
need a

153
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,520
a pointer

154
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,199
to

155
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,960
to point to the

156
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,440
to the location where where we store the

157
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,520
answer right the numbers in answer let's

158
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,880
call it i don't know i

159
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,440
equals

160
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,800
r right okay so wire

161
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,800
air is smaller

162
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,440
l is smaller than no no

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,840
so we are not actually we can do this i

164
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,000
y i is bigger or equal than zero right

165
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,240
yeah this is the index then we will

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,919
check if how do we check which one is

167
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,039
bigger we can do this absolute value

168
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,840
yeah so

169
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,400
look

170
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,520
x to x square

171
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,000
x to the power 2 equals this this to the

172
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,039
power 2 right what's this this absolute

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,800
value which is ibs the distance yeah

174
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,720
yeah correct so if abs

175
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,000
nums

176
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,160
air

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,639
bigger than abs

178
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,960
bigger equal numbs

179
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,639
ah right so we take the left one right

180
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,720
because the square will be bigger so we

181
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,720
take the left one then we can do what uh

182
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,880
so the answer let's okay so we need to

183
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,960
have our answer answer equals let's

184
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,080
allocate it uh and

185
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,560
okay

186
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,000
okay this needs to go to the front

187
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,639
we we

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,160
have an answer right which original is

189
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,000
all zero okay it doesn't matter which

190
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,479
value we save as long as we we're going

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
to overwrite updated later okay so

192
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,199
answer

193
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,160
i

194
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,000
equals num

195
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,240
air

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,840
times times 2i to the power of 2 and

197
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,520
then l plus equal 1

198
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,599
s answer

199
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,840
i equal then we take the number on the

200
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,639
right num

201
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,479
r

202
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,400
time time 2

203
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,520
and then r minus equal one and then

204
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,280
return answer yeah no b yeah

205
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,000
okay

206
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,360
yeah yeah that time the next thing we

207
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,880
talked about the time that let's say

208
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,039
something

209
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
okay

210
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,120
look uh okay so there's one thing

211
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,200
missing is i we need to i i minus equal

212
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,120
one because every time we we

213
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,560
choose a number we need to move the

214
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,600
pointer i to the to the left right so

215
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,240
so

216
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,120
at the last we we are going to have

217
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,680
these n numbers because i originally

218
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,839
equal to n minus one

219
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,279
and then when it reaches two yellow that

220
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,600
will be exactly

221
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,600
and numbers okay

222
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,279
yeah

223
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,440
do you see

224
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,519
do you see how this works yeah

225
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,920
yeah okay okay

226
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,320
so what have we learned today so what so

227
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,399
the last solution would be just do the

228
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,600
math like you said to the mass

229
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,240
and sort it

230
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,000
no not a big deal you're not a fancy

231
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,279
thing everybody could think it yeah

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,360
every everybody can think of it

233
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,680
yeah but let's go to take the o and

234
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
again because the slotting right that's

235
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,120
all sorting but this one is a better

236
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,760
approach why is that because we're

237
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,920
making use of the fat like the original

238
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,240
array is already started so if it's

239
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,519
sorted every time we take a number we

240
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,480
want to find the

241
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,839
largest we want to find the largest uh

242
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,399
square

243
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,519
yeah it can only be in two numbers on

244
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,600
the left

245
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,240
with the smallest or the right the

246
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,560
biggest right so we have two pointer we

247
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,959
pick one which is going to give us the

248
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,200
largest square and then we'll move the

249
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,360
pointer right okay

250
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,480
yeah so we always feel that

251
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,160
the square largest as the square numbers

252
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,040
number squared from largest to the

253
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,399
smallest right this is what the i is for

254
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,480
and the time time let's say someone

255
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,399
because each number is divisible exactly

256
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,760
once two point nothing and we are not

257
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,839
sorting

258
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,920
yeah let's let's give us this a better

259
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,680
performance for this echo okay

260
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,880
yeah well that will be it for today

261
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,880
bye-bye

262
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,880
bye
