1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
yo hello

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,799
hello mr ernesto and i right here

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,080
do you still remember what's turning

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,000
john yeah yeah what paranormal when you

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,639
reverse it it's still the same can you

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,639
give me an example

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:23,439
okay a b c d egg no b a a b c b a okay

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,760
any animal race car blaze car exactly

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,760
okay

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,079
okay so yeah exactly okay so let's i

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,320
give let's see i have a few letters yeah

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,520
c c c d

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,239
d e

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,480
okay can you can use all the letters for

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,840
me or some letters sorry can you can you

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,160
give me the longest

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,239
peninsula um

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,239
by using all the letters

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,160
constructing letters each one can use

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,520
ones uh most one

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,879
okay about that

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,719
what if there's

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,680
there are three c's can you use three

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,239
c's

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,840
up to you you know so yeah anymore come

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,840
on the longest one okay

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,400
no no no you can use you can rearrange

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,840
the letter it doesn't have to be in

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,159
order

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,580
sorry i don't think you should use an a

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,650
b or e

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,650
[Music]

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,159
ccd

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,200
separate

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,640
cz and dd no not together

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,479
okay okay okay

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,280
c c d d yeah

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,600
that's that's shorter than this one yeah

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,840
that is nothing okay

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,840
yeah uh so you're saying this one is the

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,840
longest

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,360
yeah probably you're right this is the

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,320
longest yeah

44
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,439
so i knew that a b or e since there okay

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,000
no they're not two of them we're done

46
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,840
you bring a very good point okay so so

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,080
first of all

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,680
you know there are many of these yeah

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,360
that's not very good and there's some

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,239
others which is

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
like

52
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,840
for example

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,000
dc atd

54
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,280
dc a c d

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,800
yeah

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,480
well we're done b c a c d d c a c d yes

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,040
exactly that's another length of five

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,959
okay so the five is the longest right so

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,640
how do we find we want

60
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,360
you know there are many many examples

61
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,400
but

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,400
but

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,000
the task is to find out the length you

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
know it doesn't have to require you to

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,599
return the longest which one you just

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,959
need to tell me five okay okay okay let

67
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,959
me give you a negative example

68
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:04,680
what's this what's the longest

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,680
what's that

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,879
is

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,879
[Music]

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,799
yeah okay so okay so

73
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,599
that's right that's the correct strategy

74
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,120
okay

75
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,599
you know but obviously you can have

76
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,360
money yeah you can swap these you know

77
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,560
as long as eight meters you can have

78
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,040
this uh e right or c

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,760
and b yeah so there are many many

80
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,640
variants of this yes yes of course yes

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,560
okay so so what's your source if i have

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,120
a few numbers like m e i c ryan

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,519
okay so look how what's the longest so

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,879
how do we get this how do we compute the

85
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,080
longest one so why one of them is

86
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,920
find what we want to do what

87
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,760
that's the thing let's thing in person

88
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,560
that allow us to

89
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,319
to to count the number of the frequency

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
for each character what do we what what

91
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,760
is it called

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,239
you know we want to count the number of

93
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,480
frequency for each each letter a string

94
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,079
a list or whatever what what is the car

95
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,880
look me

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,919
all right come on

97
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,040
a

98
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,400
a b b c okay for example this if we want

99
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,320
to get these the count a two times b two

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,320
times c one times what what does that

101
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,040
call what kind of data structure what

102
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,320
kind of thing allow us to

103
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,199
uh dictionary yes traditionally

104
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,440
counter exactly okay area use me powder

105
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,080
yeah so if we have this counter we have

106
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,199
the numbers we have a frequency for each

107
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,120
we have a

108
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,360
m so we can get the frequency for each

109
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,759
letter right so what do we do with the

110
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,680
letter with the numbers

111
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,720
what do we do with the numbers

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,160
if it's an even number can we can we use

113
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,919
the all of the letter if it's even

114
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,680
number yeah because we can put one on

115
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:06,320
the left one or right right okay

116
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,919
because if it's like just one but if

117
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,840
there's like one

118
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,800
this

119
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,160
is one

120
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,240
yeah but it is like like a d

121
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,639
one it would be one

122
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,039
but i can use one at most one okay and

123
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,720
how about c three three times how many

124
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,280
times i can use

125
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,080
uh you can use it um

126
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,600
really yeah

127
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,120
the thing is okay c3 d1 and then a2 so

128
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,520
what's the longest

129
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,520
what's the

130
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,080
c c longest

131
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,320
a c

132
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,320
c a

133
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,800
yeah okay okay you mentioned that's a

134
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,840
very good point so so if it's a odd

135
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,720
number right look if it's an odd number

136
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,039
yeah we can use the minus one right

137
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,360
because look it's three characters three

138
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,160
c's we can use two c obviously right

139
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,120
yeah

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,960
we can use two two c but what's next

141
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,520
but

142
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,759
but we can also use almost one odd

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,479
number in the middle right am i right so

144
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,800
the point is to greet it to to use as

145
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,840
many characters as long as they are in

146
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,160
pairs

147
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,240
and then we can put one more in a meter

148
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,639
if there's an extra one but but that's

149
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,919
it no more right let's that's it no more

150
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
do you see it

151
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,479
yeah

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,410
yeah okay so we can use this counter

153
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,080
thing and then that'll be yeah

154
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,400
[Music]

155
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,759
let's quickly write this implementation

156
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
and then you'll see

157
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,360
probably you can um you know you know

158
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,639
how to do it right

159
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,919
right when

160
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,919
you're not standing in front of the

161
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,919
camera because you used to see your head

162
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
yeah

163
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,520
sorry

164
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,680
okay

165
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,380
okay so define the longest

166
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,520
longest parenthesis

167
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,240
[Music]

168
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,680
s okay for example is x so we need to go

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,319
to this d e d equals the counter right

170
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,759
yeah we count it

171
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,199
counter s

172
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,440
now answer

173
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,840
answer equals zero right

174
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,840
this is the longest parameter and okay

175
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,639
so then i want to have a counter which

176
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
is all equal to which means that if we

177
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,080
have

178
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,160
one more extra letter in the middle like

179
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,120
oh at the beginning is zero okay so

180
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,000
let's go through this dictionary for

181
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,680
i

182
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,440
in d right

183
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,919
now if

184
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,520
if d i

185
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,840
is uh

186
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,840
and one or modulus two equal

187
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,639
if it's an odd number

188
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,479
if it's an odd number what if if the

189
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,800
different frequency is an odd number so

190
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,680
we can use all of it right

191
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,240
all right yeah so answer

192
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,919
plus equal d i right

193
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,199
okay now you tell me

194
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,479
as

195
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,400
s it's a

196
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,639
term of the story what do i say it's an

197
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,280
even number right yeah if it's an even

198
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,400
number then we can use all the numbers

199
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,879
right

200
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,080
and how about its odd number

201
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,400
if there's more one or number

202
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,400
if it's odd number we can use a minus

203
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,039
one right answer plus equals d i

204
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,680
minus one i'm right look if if it's five

205
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,240
we can use four of it all right yeah

206
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,800
put one in the middle so we we put this

207
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,120
we have a counter here or equals

208
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,319
three to one so means we have extra more

209
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,199
at the end right

210
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,840
now

211
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,399
so we just need return answer

212
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,800
plus on at the end right look this is

213
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,159
quite beautiful right look everybody

214
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,839
come on

215
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,120
come

216
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,399
on look beautiful

217
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,040
let's uh

218
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,160
let's give a give it a go with some

219
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,240
example if s is empty right if s is

220
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,600
something the loop will not be executed

221
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,839
so the answer is zero right obviously if

222
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,480
s is one one character a

223
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,200
right so the d will become

224
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,080
a one right yeah so we go through this

225
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,519
uh what a one if it's an even number

226
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,920
look

227
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,959
it's all number obviously so the answer

228
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,480
plus equals bi which is one one minus

229
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,800
one equals zero

230
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,279
one minus one equals zero and odd equals

231
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,600
one so return zero plus one one right

232
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,720
because any single number is a pending

233
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,680
term right

234
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,560
how about two letters like a

235
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,080
a b okay this is example so the correct

236
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,360
answer will be

237
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,160
a or b

238
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,480
one one character okay so look if the b

239
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,640
counter thing you tell me a equals one b

240
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,000
equals one right yeah

241
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,600
because of the t

242
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,040
well

243
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,200
so this is the

244
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,160
even number this is all number okay so

245
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,320
answer plus equals zero all equals one

246
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,200
and the second iteration with the b

247
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,760
answer plus equals zero all equals one

248
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,240
and return answer plus or which is the

249
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,839
which is one okay and how about another

250
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,600
example like look

251
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
a

252
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,560
a

253
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,720
b

254
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,720
b

255
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,720
maybe let's try b b c

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,320
a a b b c okay so least this the with

257
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,120
c a a the d will be a equals 2 times b

258
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,920
equals 3 times c equals 1 okay

259
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
yeah

260
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,240
so

261
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,720
a which is even number answer plus

262
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,440
equals 2 so we have 2

263
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,079
and then b which is the odd number

264
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,959
answer plus three plus three minus one

265
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,680
right

266
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,959
and then oh i set it to one okay come on

267
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,720
yeah

268
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,760
and c equals the whole number

269
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,000
all number answer plus the plus one

270
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,560
minus one and all equals one so the

271
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,240
result would be answer

272
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,800
two plus two four yeah plus zero

273
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,040
four plus one is five so let's we can

274
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,760
use the five characters am i right

275
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,959
so we can either use the two a's

276
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,839
two b's

277
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,040
one c or two a's and three b so that

278
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,360
answer is playing do you get it

279
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,480
all right what have you learned today

280
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,480
about palindrome pandering

281
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,640
we want to construct the longest parent

282
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,040
drum using the letters you have okay

283
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,560
yeah this is one okay one one example

284
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,920
know b okay

285
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,760
uh

286
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,880
a

287
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,480
c

288
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,760
d c

289
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,360
b b

290
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,360
a a

291
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,480
okay what's the longest parameter

292
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
you can get

293
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,640
d

294
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,480
but that's not the only one yeah i know

295
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,480
because if you if you have a t in the

296
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,320
middle you can swap the abc here you can

297
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,320
have a c b and d okay

298
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,480
okay okay

299
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,200
okay so you get it yeah okay to sum up

300
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,800
okay one more sentence to sum up

301
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,839
if we tell

302
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,240
if it's

303
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,079
even frequency okay that if that that

304
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,079
character appears even number one can

305
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,320
you solve it by appending one on the

306
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,200
left one on the right right if the odd

307
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,480
number

308
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,920
we can

309
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,320
we can use

310
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,079
its frequency minus one right yeah you

311
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,240
get it yeah

312
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,160
and then we need to set it x to one one

313
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,839
character because we can use the k x

314
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,959
okay one character

315
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,959
in the middle why

316
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,639
yeah because we just have one loop going

317
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,560
through the characters at once yes let's

318
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,560
face contact c

319
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,399
o n we are using the counter right you

320
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,399
get it okay for today bye
