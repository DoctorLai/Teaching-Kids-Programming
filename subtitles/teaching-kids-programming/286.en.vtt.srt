yes
okay so i have a

6
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:07,359
okay so i have a
 

7
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,830
okay so i have a
list of numbers yeah i have this numbers

8
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:09,840
list of numbers yeah i have this numbers
 

9
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,350
list of numbers yeah i have this numbers
like uh

10
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
like uh
 

11
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,789
like uh

16
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920
10
 

17
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,150
10
20. literally

18
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
20. literally
 

19
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,230
20. literally
and i want you to pick

20
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,240
and i want you to pick
 

21
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,950
and i want you to pick
two numbers if look k numbers k equals

22
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:20,960
two numbers if look k numbers k equals
 

23
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,230
two numbers if look k numbers k equals
two i only i want you to pick k numbers

24
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
two i only i want you to pick k numbers
 

25
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,630
two i only i want you to pick k numbers
and then the difference i want to i want

26
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
and then the difference i want to i want
 

27
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,029
and then the difference i want to i want
you to find out the minimum

28
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
you to find out the minimum
 

29
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,390
you to find out the minimum
difference between

30
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
difference between
 

31
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,030
difference between
the highest and the lowest

32
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
the highest and the lowest
 

33
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,030
the highest and the lowest
of these two numbers

34
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
of these two numbers
 

35
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,990
of these two numbers
am i clear with this problem

36
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
am i clear with this problem
 

37
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,389
am i clear with this problem
so first of all pick two numbers yeah

38
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:40,399
so first of all pick two numbers yeah
 

39
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,590
so first of all pick two numbers yeah
from these

40
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
from these
 

41
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,270
from these
how many ways can you pick two numbers

42
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
how many ways can you pick two numbers
 

43
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,630
how many ways can you pick two numbers
if you're going to

44
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
if you're going to
 

45
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,029
if you're going to
early approve of him yeah if we want to

46
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
early approve of him yeah if we want to
 

47
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,869
early approve of him yeah if we want to
proof of this problem

48
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
proof of this problem
 

49
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,950
proof of this problem
then we need to pick two numbers out of

50
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
then we need to pick two numbers out of
 

51
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,270
then we need to pick two numbers out of
for example this is n numbers right

52
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
for example this is n numbers right
 

53
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,549
for example this is n numbers right
and numbers

54
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
and numbers
 

55
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,510
and numbers
and numbers

56
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
and numbers
 

57
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,270
and numbers
good question it doesn't have to be here

58
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
good question it doesn't have to be here
 

59
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,510
good question it doesn't have to be here
good question you know

60
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520

 

61
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,830

so what difference does it make we want

62
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
so what difference does it make we want
 

63
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,710
so what difference does it make we want
to pick two number k numbers right

64
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
to pick two number k numbers right
 

65
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,630
to pick two number k numbers right
we want to pick k numbers out of it and

66
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
we want to pick k numbers out of it and
 

67
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,710
we want to pick k numbers out of it and
we want to find out the maximum the

68
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:12,720
we want to find out the maximum the
 

69
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,550
we want to find out the maximum the
maximum

70
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
maximum
 

71
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,109
maximum
and minus minimum of these k numbers

72
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
and minus minimum of these k numbers
 

73
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,590
and minus minimum of these k numbers
yeah k number let's do it uh

74
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
yeah k number let's do it uh
 

75
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,990
yeah k number let's do it uh
if we saw it

76
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
if we saw it
 

77
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,870
if we saw it
good question okay

78
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
good question okay
 

79
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,190
good question okay
okay good solution maybe good guess so

80
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
okay good solution maybe good guess so
 

81
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,149
okay good solution maybe good guess so
look we also pk

82
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
look we also pk
 

83
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,630
look we also pk
okay so look we have to pk numbers and

84
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
okay so look we have to pk numbers and
 

85
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,149
okay so look we have to pk numbers and
then they make a

86
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
then they make a
 

87
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,870
then they make a
and we want to find out okay so when we

88
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
and we want to find out okay so when we
 

89
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,590
and we want to find out okay so when we
pick the k numbers we know the maximum

90
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
pick the k numbers we know the maximum
 

91
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,950
pick the k numbers we know the maximum
the highest

92
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
the highest
 

93
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,550
the highest
and the lowest

94
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
and the lowest
 

95
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,109
and the lowest
of that array yeah yeah right yeah yeah

96
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
of that array yeah yeah right yeah yeah
 

97
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,109
of that array yeah yeah right yeah yeah
let's say this this is the difference

98
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
let's say this this is the difference
 

99
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,109
let's say this this is the difference
and we want to minimize

100
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
and we want to minimize
 

101
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,830
and we want to minimize
minimize the difference

102
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
minimize the difference
 

103
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,710
minimize the difference
okay

104
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
okay
 

105
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,789
okay
we want to minimize the difference so

106
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
we want to minimize the difference so
 

107
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,630
we want to minimize the difference so
what's your approach

108
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
what's your approach
 

109
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,870
what's your approach
you mentioned yeah so look

110
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:58,880
you mentioned yeah so look
 

111
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,389
you mentioned yeah so look
first of all we can talk about the

112
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
first of all we can talk about the
 

113
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,069
first of all we can talk about the
profiling how can we put the force there

114
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
profiling how can we put the force there
 

115
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,350
profiling how can we put the force there
are n numbers

116
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
are n numbers
 

117
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,870
are n numbers
n numbers and we want to pick two

118
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
n numbers and we want to pick two
 

119
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,830
n numbers and we want to pick two
numbers

120
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840
numbers
 

121
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,350
numbers
how many ways i'm doing like remember

122
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
how many ways i'm doing like remember
 

123
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,070
how many ways i'm doing like remember
the poc will use the plc

124
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
the poc will use the plc
 

125
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,830
the poc will use the plc
yeah p or c which one

126
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
yeah p or c which one
 

127
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,229
yeah p or c which one
pix p2 num p pick k numbers out of n is

128
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
pix p2 num p pick k numbers out of n is
 

129
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,470
pix p2 num p pick k numbers out of n is
it p or c what's p what's c remember

130
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
it p or c what's p what's c remember
 

131
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,589
it p or c what's p what's c remember
yeah we are done what's p

132
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
yeah we are done what's p
 

133
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,990
yeah we are done what's p
permutation

134
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
permutation
 

135
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,990
permutation
and what's c

136
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
and what's c
 

137
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,630
and what's c
combination right

138
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
combination right
 

139
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,630
combination right
so combination does not have order use

140
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
so combination does not have order use
 

141
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,470
so combination does not have order use
the c p has a

142
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
the c p has a
 

143
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,350
the c p has a
order right complete com combination

144
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
order right complete com combination
 

145
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,350
order right complete com combination
means that look if i want to pick n

146
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
means that look if i want to pick n
 

147
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,750
means that look if i want to pick n
numbers out of k p

148
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
numbers out of k p
 

149
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,430
numbers out of k p
and then

150
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
and then
 

151
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,830
and then
then one and i will i this is the

152
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
then one and i will i this is the
 

153
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,190
then one and i will i this is the
complexity we pick b c and k numbers out

154
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
complexity we pick b c and k numbers out
 

155
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,910
complexity we pick b c and k numbers out
of n and then we want to find out the

156
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
of n and then we want to find out the
 

157
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,710
of n and then we want to find out the
the maximum and the minimum of lowest k

158
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
the maximum and the minimum of lowest k
 

159
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,589
the maximum and the minimum of lowest k
numbers so that's o n times n right

160
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
numbers so that's o n times n right
 

161
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,750
numbers so that's o n times n right
times times times k because they're k

162
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
times times times k because they're k
 

163
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,949
times times times k because they're k
numbers right

164
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
numbers right
 

165
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,949
numbers right
so the complexity will be this o c n k

166
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
so the complexity will be this o c n k
 

167
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,589
so the complexity will be this o c n k
times k what was the mk c n k is picking

168
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
times k what was the mk c n k is picking
 

169
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,070
times k what was the mk c n k is picking
k numbers out of n and it would be equal

170
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
k numbers out of n and it would be equal
 

171
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,190
k numbers out of n and it would be equal
as well

172
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
as well
 

173
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,509
as well
n factorial

174
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
n factorial
 

175
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,110
n factorial
divided by

176
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
divided by
 

177
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,589
divided by
k bacteria

178
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
k bacteria
 

179
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,710
k bacteria
and n minus k factorial okay so that's

180
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
and n minus k factorial okay so that's
 

181
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,550
and n minus k factorial okay so that's
the formula to calculate it you don't

182
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
the formula to calculate it you don't
 

183
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,110
the formula to calculate it you don't
need to remember but you have to know

184
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
need to remember but you have to know
 

185
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,750
need to remember but you have to know
that it's quite complicated if this yeah

186
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
that it's quite complicated if this yeah
 

187
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,470
that it's quite complicated if this yeah
see

188
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480

picking

192
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
picking
 

193
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,550
picking
one apple out of three how many ways of

194
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
one apple out of three how many ways of
 

195
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,670
one apple out of three how many ways of
doing that

196
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
doing that
 

197
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,509
doing that
picking one apple after three apples

198
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
picking one apple after three apples
 

199
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,910
picking one apple after three apples
three picking two apples out of three

200
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
three picking two apples out of three
 

201
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,509
three picking two apples out of three
first how many ways

202
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519
first how many ways
 

203
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,750
first how many ways
three yeah we're done look so let you

204
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
three yeah we're done look so let you
 

205
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,190
three yeah we're done look so let you
remember this here

206
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
remember this here
 

207
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,470
remember this here
n n equals c n

208
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
n n equals c n
 

209
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,630
n n equals c n
n minus m yeah because every time you

210
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
n minus m yeah because every time you
 

211
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,710
n minus m yeah because every time you
pick one apple you also have a way of

212
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
pick one apple you also have a way of
 

213
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,630
pick one apple you also have a way of
picking two levels right because

214
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
picking two levels right because
 

215
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,149
picking two levels right because
every time you separate one apple and

216
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
every time you separate one apple and
 

217
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,750
every time you separate one apple and
then they took that solution for two

218
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
then they took that solution for two
 

219
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:07,030
then they took that solution for two
years

220
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040

 

221
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,789

is this can we do better you mentioned

222
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
is this can we do better you mentioned
 

223
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,229
is this can we do better you mentioned
about sorting yeah how how do you come

224
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
about sorting yeah how how do you come
 

225
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,509
about sorting yeah how how do you come
up with this clever solution huh

226
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
up with this clever solution huh
 

227
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,670
up with this clever solution huh
if we saw this original number you can

228
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
if we saw this original number you can
 

229
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,909
if we saw this original number you can
just look with first thing and then just

230
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
just look with first thing and then just
 

231
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,789
just look with first thing and then just
drag the left yeah so if we saw the

232
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
drag the left yeah so if we saw the
 

233
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,069
drag the left yeah so if we saw the
number

234
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
number
 

235
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,590
number
so if we saw this number what's the

236
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
so if we saw this number what's the
 

237
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,030
so if we saw this number what's the
order

238
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
order
 

239
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,990

245
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,710
10 20. if we if we by the way if we saw
the numbers what's the time complexity

246
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
the numbers what's the time complexity
 

247
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,610
the numbers what's the time complexity
if there are n numbers

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,670
we're done okay oh and again we can use
the quick solve much solved you know

254
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:39,680
the quick solve much solved you know
 

255
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,550
the quick solve much solved you know
yeah those solutions are all in logan

256
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
yeah those solutions are all in logan
 

257
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,390
yeah those solutions are all in logan
but if we go for bubble sorting yeah

258
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
but if we go for bubble sorting yeah
 

259
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,189
but if we go for bubble sorting yeah
simple soaking that will be oh

260
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
simple soaking that will be oh
 

261
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,030
simple soaking that will be oh
and square right well usually

262
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040

 

263
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,110

so look this number and we only pick two

264
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
so look this number and we only pick two
 

265
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,790
so look this number and we only pick two
numbers

266
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
numbers
 

267
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,390
numbers
pick two numbers so we can go through

268
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
pick two numbers so we can go through
 

269
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,230
pick two numbers so we can go through
this yeah yeah

270
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
this yeah yeah
 

271
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,590
this yeah yeah
what's the difference between these two

272
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
what's the difference between these two
 

273
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,790
what's the difference between these two
numbers

274
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
numbers
 

275
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,550

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560

 

277
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,990

what's this

278
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
what's this
 

279
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,350
what's this
one one three seven

280
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
one one three seven
 

281
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,270
one one three seven
ten i can't do it okay what's the

282
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
ten i can't do it okay what's the
 

283
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,550
ten i can't do it okay what's the
minimum

284
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
minimum
 

285
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,670
minimum
one one yeah that's it yeah correct why

286
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
one one yeah that's it yeah correct why
 

287
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,790
one one yeah that's it yeah correct why
this solution is working why because why

288
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
this solution is working why because why
 

289
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,629
this solution is working why because why
can you imagine if we solve these

290
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
can you imagine if we solve these
 

291
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,950
can you imagine if we solve these
numbers and we pick the lowest and the

292
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
numbers and we pick the lowest and the
 

293
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,110
numbers and we pick the lowest and the
highest we want to minimize it right so

294
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
highest we want to minimize it right so
 

295
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,510
highest we want to minimize it right so
if you want to minimize it we want this

296
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
if you want to minimize it we want this
 

297
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,790
if you want to minimize it we want this
number to be 20 is the highest yeah but

298
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
number to be 20 is the highest yeah but
 

299
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,270
number to be 20 is the highest yeah but
i want to find the distance the third is

300
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280
i want to find the distance the third is
 

301
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,270
i want to find the distance the third is
the minimum the maximum and minimum

302
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
the minimum the maximum and minimum
 

303
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,629
the minimum the maximum and minimum
minimum maximum and minimum of k numbers

304
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
minimum maximum and minimum of k numbers
 

305
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,950
minimum maximum and minimum of k numbers
if we pick 10 and 20

306
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
if we pick 10 and 20
 

307
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,189
if we pick 10 and 20
the maximum is 20 the minimum is 10 the

308
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
the maximum is 20 the minimum is 10 the
 

309
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,110
the maximum is 20 the minimum is 10 the
difference is 10 right

310
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
difference is 10 right
 

311
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,950
difference is 10 right
so if we pick 20 and we pick one what's

312
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
so if we pick 20 and we pick one what's
 

313
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,230
so if we pick 20 and we pick one what's
the difference

314
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
the difference
 

315
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,790
the difference
19. you see you see the difference so we

316
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
19. you see you see the difference so we
 

317
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,469
19. you see you see the difference so we
why this solution is working because we

318
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
why this solution is working because we
 

319
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,710
why this solution is working because we
want to we want to make sure these k

320
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
want to we want to make sure these k
 

321
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,830
want to we want to make sure these k
numbers

322
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
numbers
 

323
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,390
numbers
stay as close as possible so how do we

324
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
stay as close as possible so how do we
 

325
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,710
stay as close as possible so how do we
make sure those numbers stay as close as

326
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
make sure those numbers stay as close as
 

327
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,070
make sure those numbers stay as close as
possible

328
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
possible
 

329
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,350
possible
we sort it right if we sort it

330
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
we sort it right if we sort it
 

331
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,070
we sort it right if we sort it
right this number look if we pick two

332
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
right this number look if we pick two
 

333
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,390
right this number look if we pick two
numbers if we pick three numbers what's

334
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
numbers if we pick three numbers what's
 

335
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,950
numbers if we pick three numbers what's
the shortest distance one the thirteen

336
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
the shortest distance one the thirteen
 

337
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,550
the shortest distance one the thirteen
distance here right

338
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
distance here right
 

339
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,790
distance here right
yeah because look ten minus one is

340
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
yeah because look ten minus one is
 

341
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,950
yeah because look ten minus one is
always bigger than three minus one

342
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
always bigger than three minus one
 

343
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,950
always bigger than three minus one
because we after sorting these numbers

344
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
because we after sorting these numbers
 

345
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,749
because we after sorting these numbers
stay close to each other right so look

346
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
stay close to each other right so look
 

347
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,390
stay close to each other right so look
if we saw this original uh array we use

348
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
if we saw this original uh array we use
 

349
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,070
if we saw this original uh array we use
o and log n

350
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
o and log n
 

351
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,950
o and log n
right and then we pick k numbers so we

352
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
right and then we pick k numbers so we
 

353
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,629
right and then we pick k numbers so we
just need to try

354
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
just need to try
 

355
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,430
just need to try
the pairs right the highest right but

356
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
the pairs right the highest right but
 

357
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,230
the pairs right the highest right but
every we we divide this certain array

358
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
every we we divide this certain array
 

359
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,430
every we we divide this certain array
into

360
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
into
 

361
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,469
into
groups of k so like that like that like

362
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
groups of k so like that like that like
 

363
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,629
groups of k so like that like that like
that and we just try

364
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
that and we just try
 

365
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,950
that and we just try
the the brightness the highest the

366
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
the the brightness the highest the
 

367
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,469
the the brightness the highest the
maximum and the minimum

368
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
maximum and the minimum
 

369
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,710
maximum and the minimum
we calculate the difference and we keep

370
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
we calculate the difference and we keep
 

371
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,629
we calculate the difference and we keep
doing that we store that we update the

372
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
doing that we store that we update the
 

373
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,270
doing that we store that we update the
minimum right okay that's it

374
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
minimum right okay that's it
 

375
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,430
minimum right okay that's it
so let's try the code if you can

376
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
so let's try the code if you can
 

377
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,589
so let's try the code if you can
you know today's code code is pressing

378
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
you know today's code code is pressing
 

379
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,110
you know today's code code is pressing
but if you can implement it you'll be

380
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
but if you can implement it you'll be
 

381
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,870
but if you can implement it you'll be
just two lines

382
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
just two lines
 

383
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,629
just two lines
to learn yeah

384
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639

 

385
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,830

mean

386
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
mean
 

387
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,870
mean
it has

388
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
it has
 

389
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,430
it has
mean k different yeah different let's

390
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
mean k different yeah different let's
 

391
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,270
mean k different yeah different let's
say numbers

392
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
say numbers
 

393
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,029
say numbers
and then k right i think

394
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
and then k right i think
 

395
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,629
and then k right i think
okay so which one the first one we need

396
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
okay so which one the first one we need
 

397
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,749
okay so which one the first one we need
to solve the numbers the num stocks what

398
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
to solve the numbers the num stocks what
 

399
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,909
to solve the numbers the num stocks what
sort yeah we're done it's going to be

400
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
sort yeah we're done it's going to be
 

401
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,749
sort yeah we're done it's going to be
three lines

402
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
three lines
 

403
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,749
three lines
no not including this line okay this is

404
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
no not including this line okay this is
 

405
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,950
no not including this line okay this is
the function that we're gonna let's

406
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
the function that we're gonna let's
 

407
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,029
the function that we're gonna let's
implementation now we want to find out

408
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
implementation now we want to find out
 

409
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,469
implementation now we want to find out
look after this

410
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
look after this
 

411
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,110
look after this
this is a number yeah one two three ten

412
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
this is a number yeah one two three ten
 

413
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,469
this is a number yeah one two three ten
twenty okay

414
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
twenty okay
 

415
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,550
twenty okay
so this is nums yeah now this is the

416
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
so this is nums yeah now this is the
 

417
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,189
so this is nums yeah now this is the
number so we now we want to find out

418
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
number so we now we want to find out
 

419
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,270
number so we now we want to find out
this each group of the difference so

420
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
this each group of the difference so
 

421
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,510
this each group of the difference so
what we can

422
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
what we can
 

423
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,270
what we can
minimum yeah minimum what num

424
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
minimum yeah minimum what num
 

425
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,110
minimum yeah minimum what num
nums

426
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
nums
 

427
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,150
nums
so if we start with these nums uh

428
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
so if we start with these nums uh
 

429
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,869
so if we start with these nums uh
so this this is i and what's what's this

430
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
so this this is i and what's what's this
 

431
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,390
so this this is i and what's what's this
number what's this number

432
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,400
number what's this number
 

433
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,830
number what's this number
what's this i plus k

434
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
what's this i plus k
 

435
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,150
what's this i plus k
minus one right yeah

436
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
minus one right yeah
 

437
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,990
minus one right yeah
got it yeah so look numbs i plus k minus

438
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
got it yeah so look numbs i plus k minus
 

439
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,909
got it yeah so look numbs i plus k minus
one minus

440
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919

minus k
 

451
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,029
minus k
minus k so out this i will be

452
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
minus k so out this i will be
 

453
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,829
minus k so out this i will be
up to this point right so k is what one

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,269
five
and we want to get this point the last

460
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
and we want to get this point the last
 

461
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,070
and we want to get this point the last
index will be zero one two three

462
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
index will be zero one two three
 

463
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,750
index will be zero one two three
three yeah

464
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
three yeah
 

465
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,509
three yeah
so what five minus two

466
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
so what five minus two
 

467
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,269
so what five minus two
uh yeah minus k uh minus is minus k

468
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
uh yeah minus k uh minus is minus k
 

469
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,030
uh yeah minus k uh minus is minus k
minus k plus one plus plus one we need

470
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
minus k plus one plus plus one we need
 

471
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,350
minus k plus one plus plus one we need
to have plus one right

472
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
to have plus one right
 

473
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,949
to have plus one right
right we need to pass one here

474
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959

 

475
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,509

length numbers is five

476
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
length numbers is five
 

477
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,430
length numbers is five
five minus

478
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440
five minus
 

479
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,150
five minus
uh k is two

480
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
uh k is two
 

481
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,350
uh k is two
plus one

482
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:09,360
plus one
 

483
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,190
plus one
right up to this point because up to

484
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
right up to this point because up to
 

485
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,070
right up to this point because up to
range right so that this will be four so

486
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
range right so that this will be four so
 

487
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,150
range right so that this will be four so
range up to four so the last index will

488
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
range up to four so the last index will
 

489
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,870
range up to four so the last index will
be three zero one two three okay okay

490
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
be three zero one two three okay okay
 

491
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,949
be three zero one two three okay okay
that's it so basically look

492
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
that's it so basically look
 

493
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,630
that's it so basically look
mean numbs i plus k minus 1 is this one

494
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
mean numbs i plus k minus 1 is this one
 

495
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,550
mean numbs i plus k minus 1 is this one
minus minus num i is this one for i in

496
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
minus minus num i is this one for i in
 

497
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,190
minus minus num i is this one for i in
range for this i in range from 0 to

498
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,200
range for this i in range from 0 to
 

499

this is less numbs minus k plus one but

502
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
this is less numbs minus k plus one but
 

503
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,430
this is less numbs minus k plus one but
not including right remember this range

504
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
not including right remember this range
 

505
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,670
not including right remember this range
function yes range 10

506
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
function yes range 10
 

507
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,070
function yes range 10
what's what's what does 1 10 give us

508
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080

 

509
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,110

511
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,949
0
1 2 3 up to

512
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
1 2 3 up to
 

513
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,110
1 2 3 up to
nine nine it doesn't include a ten right

514
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
nine nine it doesn't include a ten right
 

515
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,550
nine nine it doesn't include a ten right
that's why we plus one it doesn't

516
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
that's why we plus one it doesn't
 

517
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,070
that's why we plus one it doesn't
include the plus one

518
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
include the plus one
 

519
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,269
include the plus one
okay

520
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
okay
 

521
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,829
okay
another way another way look another way

522
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
another way another way look another way
 

523
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,990
another way another way look another way
is we can we can use this k here so

524
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
is we can we can use this k here so
 

525
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,990
is we can we can use this k here so
you'll be nums i

526
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
you'll be nums i
 

527
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,269
you'll be nums i
right

528
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
right
 

529
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,350
right
no no no numbs i

530
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
no no no numbs i
 

531
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,910
no no no numbs i
numbs i let's say nums is here and then

532
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
numbs i let's say nums is here and then
 

533
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,910
numbs i let's say nums is here and then
numbs i

534
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
numbs i
 

535
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,350
numbs i
minus k

536
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
minus k
 

537
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,590
minus k
right i'm nice minus k so i is 1 1 minus

538
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
right i'm nice minus k so i is 1 1 minus
 

539
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,949
right i'm nice minus k so i is 1 1 minus
k

540
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
k
 

541
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,790
k
we need minus k

542
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
we need minus k
 

543
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,110
we need minus k
plus one right because numbers k plus

544
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
plus one right because numbers k plus
 

545
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,710
plus one right because numbers k plus
one lambda k plus one

546
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
one lambda k plus one
 

547
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,509
one lambda k plus one
and then for i in range

548
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
and then for i in range
 

549
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,389
and then for i in range
range k minus one up to length number

550
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
range k minus one up to length number
 

551
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,550
range k minus one up to length number
right because the first first index

552
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
right because the first first index
 

553
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,310
right because the first first index
would be 0 1

554
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
would be 0 1
 

555
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,310
would be 0 1
right if this is k

556
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
right if this is k
 

557
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,310
right if this is k
right this will go to the end and then

558
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
right this will go to the end and then
 

559
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,069
right this will go to the end and then
you you look for the k i minus k plus 1.

560
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
you you look for the k i minus k plus 1.
 

561
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,509
you you look for the k i minus k plus 1.
does it make sense

562
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
does it make sense
 

563
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,389
does it make sense
yeah okay so can you explain to me

564
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
yeah okay so can you explain to me
 

565
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,230
yeah okay so can you explain to me
what's the approach what's this approach

566
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
what's the approach what's this approach
 

567
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,710
what's the approach what's this approach
so definitely first of all we need to

568
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
so definitely first of all we need to
 

569
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,829
so definitely first of all we need to

[Music]
 

571
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,380
[Music]
um and then right now

572
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:57,390
um and then right now
 

573
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,870
um and then right now
[Music]

574
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
[Music]
 

575
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,030
[Music]
yeah we need to check the every

576
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
yeah we need to check the every
 

577
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,550
yeah we need to check the every
every group of the k

578
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
every group of the k
 

579
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,550
every group of the k
yeah because we are looking for the

580
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
yeah because we are looking for the
 

581
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,230
yeah because we are looking for the
minimum of

582
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
minimum of
 

583
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,990
minimum of
this uh

584
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
this uh
 

585
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,910
this uh
mean maximum

586
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
mean maximum
 

587
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,990
mean maximum
this k array k array minus mean k array

588
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
this k array k array minus mean k array
 

589
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,310
this k array k array minus mean k array
right

590
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320

 

591
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,630

if we sort it the maximum of this k

592
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
if we sort it the maximum of this k
 

593
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,430
if we sort it the maximum of this k
array will be the rightmost yeah open on

594
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
array will be the rightmost yeah open on
 

595
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,150
array will be the rightmost yeah open on
the right hand side right yeah

596
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
the right hand side right yeah
 

597
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,230
the right hand side right yeah
and then the minimum will be on the left

598
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
and then the minimum will be on the left
 

599
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,829
and then the minimum will be on the left
hand side why is that because this array

600
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
hand side why is that because this array
 

601
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,550
hand side why is that because this array
is already sorted right if k is equal to

602
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
is already sorted right if k is equal to
 

603
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,670
is already sorted right if k is equal to
three

604
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
three
 

605
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,750
three
for example if k equals three

606
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
for example if k equals three
 

607
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,550
for example if k equals three
all right

608
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
all right
 

609
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,069
all right
right right n

610
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
right right n
 

611
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,310
right right n
listen is k equals three

612
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
listen is k equals three
 

613
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,190
listen is k equals three
two three ten what's the maximum okay

614
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
two three ten what's the maximum okay
 

615
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,509
two three ten what's the maximum okay
what's the measurement

616
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
what's the measurement
 

617
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,269
what's the measurement
what's the minimum

618
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
what's the minimum
 

619
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,350
what's the minimum
is it very easy yeah because always the

620
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
is it very easy yeah because always the
 

621
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,670
is it very easy yeah because always the
maximum of this sub array is always on

622
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
maximum of this sub array is always on
 

623
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,910
maximum of this sub array is always on
the right most right correct and the

624
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
the right most right correct and the
 

625
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,069
the right most right correct and the
minimum is only on the left most i can

626
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
minimum is only on the left most i can
 

627
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,990
minimum is only on the left most i can
even if this is i the index i and then

628
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
even if this is i the index i and then
 

629
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,870
even if this is i the index i and then
this index will be i minus k plus one

630
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
this index will be i minus k plus one
 

631
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,629
this index will be i minus k plus one
yeah easy right

632
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
yeah easy right
 

633
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,790
yeah easy right
let's that's the that's why we saw this

634
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
let's that's the that's why we saw this
 

635
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,350
let's that's the that's why we saw this
array because once we saw that we can

636
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
array because once we saw that we can
 

637
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,629
array because once we saw that we can
find the

638
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
find the
 

639
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,030
find the
maximum and the minimum in constant time

640
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
maximum and the minimum in constant time
 

641
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,949
maximum and the minimum in constant time
just by looking at the index right

642
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
just by looking at the index right
 

643
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,269
just by looking at the index right
because it's always sorted am right

644
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
because it's always sorted am right
 

645
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,350
because it's always sorted am right
yeah and then we just need to check

646
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
yeah and then we just need to check
 

647
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,949
yeah and then we just need to check
check

648
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
check
 

649
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,750
check
check what i times right and n times for

650
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
check what i times right and n times for
 

651
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,910
check what i times right and n times for
the sub k times for the sub array right

652
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
the sub k times for the sub array right
 

653
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,710
the sub k times for the sub array right
uh

654
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
uh
 

655
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,030
uh
how many so what's that yeah k times

656
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
how many so what's that yeah k times
 

657
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,350
how many so what's that yeah k times
no is this k times no

658
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
no is this k times no
 

659
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,230
no is this k times no
then

660
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
then
 

661
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,910
then
length n minus k times yeah yeah n minus

662
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
length n minus k times yeah yeah n minus
 

663
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,110
length n minus k times yeah yeah n minus
k times nothing or okay minus one okay

664
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
k times nothing or okay minus one okay
 

665
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,750
k times nothing or okay minus one okay
so this is o n log n and this is all n

666
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
so this is o n log n and this is all n
 

667
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,829
so this is o n log n and this is all n
minus so what's the time complexity of

668
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
minus so what's the time complexity of
 

669
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,430
minus so what's the time complexity of
all

670
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440
all
 

671
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,150
all
what which one is uh more time consuming

672
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
what which one is uh more time consuming
 

673
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,230
what which one is uh more time consuming
this one or this one

674
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
this one or this one
 

675
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,829
this one or this one
which which is that this aggregate

676
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:51,839
which which is that this aggregate
 

677
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,750
which which is that this aggregate
consists of two steps first of all

678
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
consists of two steps first of all
 

679
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,790
consists of two steps first of all
sourcing

680
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
sourcing
 

681
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,949
sourcing
oh and again the second time it's all

682
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
oh and again the second time it's all
 

683
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,030
oh and again the second time it's all
linear yeah because we're just scanning

684
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
linear yeah because we're just scanning
 

685
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,870
linear yeah because we're just scanning
scanningly away yeah no

686
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
scanningly away yeah no
 

687
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,990
scanningly away yeah no
salt

688
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
salt
 

689
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,069
salt
this is more time consuming well done so

690
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
this is more time consuming well done so
 

691
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,710
this is more time consuming well done so
this is dominating so yeah so what's the

692
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
this is dominating so yeah so what's the
 

693
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,150
this is dominating so yeah so what's the
time convexity for all the holy

694
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
time convexity for all the holy
 

695
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,190
time convexity for all the holy
speculation okay again

696
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
speculation okay again
 

697
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,110
speculation okay again
oh and okay okay that's it for today

698
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
oh and okay okay that's it for today
 

699
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,870
oh and okay okay that's it for today
good job
