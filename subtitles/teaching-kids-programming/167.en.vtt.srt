00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,790
uh
average levels of binary enough enough

8
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
average levels of binary enough enough
 

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,990
average levels of binary enough enough
okay so let's let's draw a final three

10
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
okay so let's let's draw a final three
 

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,670
okay so let's let's draw a final three
seven um

yeah yeah yeah average yeah so look how

28
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
yeah yeah yeah average yeah so look how
 

29
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,150
yeah yeah yeah average yeah so look how
many numbers

30
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
many numbers
 

31
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,630
many numbers
three three another average of the first

32
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
three three another average of the first
 

33
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,069
three three another average of the first
level is

34
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
level is
 

35
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,790
level is
the average is sum divided by count

36
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
the average is sum divided by count
 

37
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,430
the average is sum divided by count
right

38
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
right
 

39
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,029
right
how many numbers so sum is seven

40
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
how many numbers so sum is seven
 

41
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:02,709
how many numbers so sum is seven
one not seven say eight

42
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719

 

43
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,030

three plus one is four plus two is six

44
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
three plus one is four plus two is six
 

45
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,310
three plus one is four plus two is six
divided by two

46
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
divided by two
 

47
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,950
divided by two
equals three no by three that's three

48
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
equals three no by three that's three
 

49
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,390
equals three no by three that's three
notes they're supposed to be

50
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,400
notes they're supposed to be
 

51
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,429
notes they're supposed to be
two okay sorry yeah you're all right

52
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
two okay sorry yeah you're all right
 

53

two okay sorry yeah you're all right
yeah that's a

54
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
yeah that's a
 

55
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,550
yeah that's a
that's the mistake yeah good job picking

56
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
that's the mistake yeah good job picking
 

57
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,830
that's the mistake yeah good job picking
it up yeah

58
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
it up yeah
 

59
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,270
it up yeah
yeah okay so what's how do we do this oh

60
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
yeah okay so what's how do we do this oh
 

61
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,630
yeah okay so what's how do we do this oh
okay so uh so the

62
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640
okay so uh so the
 

63
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,870
okay so uh so the
route is definitely the same because

64
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
route is definitely the same because
 

65
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,149
route is definitely the same because
yeah you know

66
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159

69
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,370
there's only one so but i'm talking
about which accurate references

70
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:32,380
about which accurate references
 

71

yeah actually can solve this problem
we'll talk about different search

76
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
we'll talk about different search
 

77
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,830
we'll talk about different search
tomorrow today about let's talk about

78
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
tomorrow today about let's talk about
 

79

breakfast search
 

81
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,950
breakfast search
so when we're traveling that tree the

82
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
so when we're traveling that tree the
 

83
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,230
so when we're traveling that tree the
breakfast search

breakfast search
 

85
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,190
breakfast search
travels the level by level right yeah

86
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
travels the level by level right yeah
 

87
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,670
travels the level by level right yeah
when we travel a level by level

when we travel a level by level
 

89
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,550
when we travel a level by level
so look the key thing here is ryan eric

90
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
so look the key thing here is ryan eric
 

91
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,069
so look the key thing here is ryan eric
listen the key thing is that

listen the key thing is that
 

93
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,270
listen the key thing is that
we we do you still remember what's the

94
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
we we do you still remember what's the
 

95
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,149
we we do you still remember what's the
preference search oh it's my level 7

96
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
preference search oh it's my level 7
 

97
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,670
preference search oh it's my level 7
8 10 3 1 2. okay then what kind of data

98
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
8 10 3 1 2. okay then what kind of data
 

99
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,510
8 10 3 1 2. okay then what kind of data
structure do we need to use to implement

100
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:05,520
structure do we need to use to implement
 

101
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,869
structure do we need to use to implement
a preference search

102
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879

 

103
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,190

what how do we take care of you first

104
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
what how do we take care of you first
 

105
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,070
what how do we take care of you first
thing last time yeah and how do we

106
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
thing last time yeah and how do we
 

107
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,910
thing last time yeah and how do we
no first thing first of all first thing

108
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
no first thing first of all first thing
 

109
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,190
no first thing first of all first thing
that's the last step

110
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
that's the last step
 

111
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,830
that's the last step
oh yeah first thing that last stop

112
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
oh yeah first thing that last stop
 

113
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,869
oh yeah first thing that last stop
remember the stack

114
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
remember the stack
 

115
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,430
remember the stack
you know we talked about oh a few days

116
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
you know we talked about oh a few days
 

117
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,309
you know we talked about oh a few days
ago we talked

118
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
ago we talked
 

119
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,309
ago we talked
talked about the seeing the sea on the

120
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
talked about the seeing the sea on the
 

121
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,430
talked about the seeing the sea on the
right yeah

122
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
right yeah
 

123
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,910
right yeah
that was one of the funny videos yeah

124
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
that was one of the funny videos yeah
 

125
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,630
that was one of the funny videos yeah
and then

126
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
and then
 

127
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,710
and then
you see that the thing that monotone is

128
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
you see that the thing that monotone is
 

129
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,070
you see that the thing that monotone is
decreasing right

130
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
decreasing right
 

131
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,030
decreasing right
a stack right but we talk about the the

132
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
a stack right but we talk about the the
 

133
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,949
a stack right but we talk about the the
queue here is first in first sound

134
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
queue here is first in first sound
 

135
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,990
queue here is first in first sound
and in python what do we what can how do

136
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
and in python what do we what can how do
 

137
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,550
and in python what do we what can how do
we declare a queue

138
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
we declare a queue
 

139
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,509
we declare a queue
what's the mean double ended key what

140
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
what's the mean double ended key what
 

141
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,309
what's the mean double ended key what
what does it mean

142

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,869
seven okay seven okay now
okay okay now while the q is not empty

188
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
okay okay now while the q is not empty
 

189
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,270

so we have this why there is any man in
 

193
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,030
so we have this why there is any man in
the queue right why is that

194
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
the queue right why is that
 

195
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,190
the queue right why is that
send it here we what should we do we

push we first of all we
 

199
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,949
push we first of all we
we see how many nodes in the queue

200
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
we see how many nodes in the queue
 

201
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,470
we see how many nodes in the queue
there's only one node yeah

202
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
there's only one node yeah
 

203
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,589
there's only one node yeah
right so we take this one node oh take

204
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
right so we take this one node oh take
 

205
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,910
right so we take this one node oh take
all the node so we first of all we know

206
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
all the node so we first of all we know
 

207
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,710
all the node so we first of all we know
how many

208
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
how many
 

209
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,270
how many
nodes in the queue we take this first of

210
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
nodes in the queue we take this first of
 

211
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,630
nodes in the queue we take this first of
all the notes out

212
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
all the notes out
 

213
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,350
all the notes out
yeah seven we push all the keys of it so

214
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
yeah seven we push all the keys of it so
 

215
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,710
yeah seven we push all the keys of it so
which is what

216
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
which is what
 

217
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,229
which is what
eight and ten eight and ten so look

218
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
eight and ten eight and ten so look
 

219
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,710
eight and ten eight and ten so look
so when i take it out it's a and ten

220
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
so when i take it out it's a and ten
 

221
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,309
so when i take it out it's a and ten
what does it mean a and 10 are

222
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
what does it mean a and 10 are
 

223
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,550
what does it mean a and 10 are
on the same level so we know the average

224
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
on the same level so we know the average
 

225
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,069
on the same level so we know the average
which is nine right

226
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
which is nine right
 

227
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,990
which is nine right
so we put a nine there but when we take

228
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
so we put a nine there but when we take
 

229
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,110
so we put a nine there but when we take
it out we know also know

230
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
it out we know also know
 

231
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,070
it out we know also know
it's seven so seven nine okay so take it

232
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
it's seven so seven nine okay so take it
 

233
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,749
it's seven so seven nine okay so take it
out and push the eight and nine

234
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
out and push the eight and nine
 

235
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,550
out and push the eight and nine
o and ten okay now there are two

236
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
o and ten okay now there are two
 

237
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,230
o and ten okay now there are two
elements in the queue right

238
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
elements in the queue right
 

239
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,830
elements in the queue right
yeah so add them together no no no no

240
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
yeah so add them together no no no no
 

241
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,590
yeah so add them together no no no no
i already add them together which is

242
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
i already add them together which is
 

243
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,590
i already add them together which is
nine divided by two i already know

244
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
nine divided by two i already know
 

245
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,469
nine divided by two i already know
now i want to take orders and then you

246
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
now i want to take orders and then you
 

247
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,270
now i want to take orders and then you
mix up

248
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
mix up
 

249
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,270
mix up
then then you stay in planet pieces

250
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
then then you stay in planet pieces
 

251
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,230
then then you stay in planet pieces
so 8 and 10 so what should we do next i

252
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
so 8 and 10 so what should we do next i
 

253
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,870
so 8 and 10 so what should we do next i
take all

254
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
take all
 

255
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,510
take all
nine out yeah yeah i take all of them

256
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
nine out yeah yeah i take all of them
 

257
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,629
nine out yeah yeah i take all of them
take 8 and 10 take it all and then

258
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
take 8 and 10 take it all and then
 

259
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,590
take 8 and 10 take it all and then
and then we shall put all the kids of it

260
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
and then we shall put all the kids of it
 

261
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,469
and then we shall put all the kids of it
it's three

262
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
it's three
 

263
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,830
it's three
one two three one two

one two three one two
 

265
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,469
one two three one two
because we know it's three one two so we

266
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
because we know it's three one two so we
 

267
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,550
because we know it's three one two so we
already know this v one two is the same

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
and i push the kids of it so the key
 

277
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,110
and i push the kids of it so the key
all the notes in the queue are there

278
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
all the notes in the queue are there
 

279
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,029
all the notes in the queue are there
only some level

280
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
only some level
 

281
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,629
only some level
yes or not uh yeah yeah okay this is the

282

okay in this case yeah

346
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
okay in this case yeah
 

347
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,710

to calculate the sum
 

355
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,029
to calculate the sum
so first of all i have some equals

356
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
so first of all i have some equals
 

357
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,270
so first of all i have some equals
equals zero right and how many nodes are

equals zero right and how many nodes are
 

359
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,830

there
 

361
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,670
there
you know two so n equals then q right

362
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
you know two so n equals then q right
 

363
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,830
