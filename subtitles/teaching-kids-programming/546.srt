1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:06,060
right okay so today we'll talk about

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,460
this question how many matches are

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,580
played during the World Cup we know that

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,580
they are 32 teams right 32 teams how

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,039
many groups are there eight eight so a a

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,060
b c d e f g right four teams one two

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,220
three four five six seven eight they are

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,800
eight groups

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,619
so in the group how many matches I

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,019
played six yeah how do we get the six we

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,600
have four teams right so for each team

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,739
to play against

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,899
realities right so One play with two

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,239
you know for one place with two is the

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,940
same as two players one right

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,719
and one plays with three what I'm

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:53,520
playing with four two three two four

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,219
three four right plus six look level we

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,620
are picking two without considering the

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,160
order the sequence does not matter what

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,160
do we call this

22
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,939
contract

23
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:09,479
combination combination so we use this

24
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:14,280
symbols C for forever picking two right

25
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:17,100
so eight groups so times a right this is

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,840
the matches we need to play here in the

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:25,460
group stages so how many teams qualified

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,920
to the you know to the next round

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:34,740
half of them right so only the first two

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:37,700
in in Groom stage okay so half women

31
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:42,780
qualified so how many teams are there

32
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:45,240
16 right 16 teams so now into the next

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,180
stage which is knockout right how many

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,820
matches play in the next

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,159
so put it this way if we play one match

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,680
during this knockout how many teams are

37
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,720
eliminated one so in order to get the

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,180
champion how many teams need to be

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,000
unlimited yeah 15 so we need to plus 15

40
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,659
right but there's one more match which

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,099
is happening in the semi-finals right in

42
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,099
the same in the finals there are four

43
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,900
teams right and The Losers of each team

44
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,300
for example this one and this one needs

45
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,400
to play against each other to decide who

46
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,200
is going to be the third one right third

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,360
place or fourth place and I still

48
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,280
request one so how many are they so how

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
do we get this number foreign

50
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,020
[Music]

51
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,700
first of all we need to find out the

52
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,280
ways to pick two apples without sequence

53
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,379
right and once we have two apples we can

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,760
permutate do a four permutation which is

55
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:10,620
the n Factor right yeah so c n n CNN

56
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,920
C and zero equals one right picking

57
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,200
nothing One Way c n n apples kicking and

58
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,540
nipples how many ways one one way yeah

59
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,200
okay

60
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:25,620
CNN equals c n n minus n right

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,440
other interpolarities they are forever

62
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,300
I want to pick one apples how many were

63
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,239
picking one letters four episodes I want

64
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,860
to pick one of those how many ways

65
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,620
how many ways picking three letters four

66
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,260
yeah look if I pick one of us and there

67
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,440
are three efforts in pair right picking

68
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,080
least if we pick these

69
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,540
you play this and that gives another

70
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,560
option of picking Vehicles okay so this

71
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:56,099
is what it is CNN equals n factorial

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,180
divided by n factorial n minus n

73
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:02,819
factorial right and P and and

74
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:07,440
bacteria n minus n factorial

75
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:11,879
all right so P and M equals C and M

76
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:15,840
times M factorial right yeah so is it

77
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:19,500
is it true so this one comes n factorial

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:24,500
is this one okay one one one one two one

79
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,500
one three three one what's this one

80
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:32,340
oh yes so look at this number any number

81
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,259
this number this number equals the sum

82
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:39,479
of this this number equals the sum of

83
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:40,560
this right F all right so c n m equals c

84
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,000
n

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,900
minus one n plus c n minus 1 and minus

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,880
all right

87
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,040
yeah so look

88
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,020
this one this number equals the shoulder

89
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,320
the sum of the shoulder so how do we

90
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,000
integrate this we talk about this okay

91
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,220
and Airport

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,919
and apples

93
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,620
they are NFL we want to Pick n apples

94
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,580
right so for this one how many ways we

95
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,380
can pick it we pick or we skip right

96
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,160
if we pick

97
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,259
if we pick we have n minus one apples

98
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,340
but we have to pick a minus one if we

99
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,740
don't pick

100
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,080
we have n minus one but we still have n

101
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,919
apples to Big all right is it simple to

102
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,440
understand this this equation

103
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:30,840
right yeah we want to pick another let's

104
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,900
look at this apple first

105
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,000
and of course I want to Pick n apples

106
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,340
but for this one the first Apple how

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,460
many ways I I can make a choice I pick

108
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,520
it or I skip it right if I pick it

109
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,580
how many apples I need to pick n minus

110
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,620
one but from n minus one right here is

111
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,940
Amazon if we don't pick it how many

112
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,139
apples we still have to take

113
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,560
because I don't pick this one I haven't

114
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,539
make a choice right so it's an apple but

115
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,820
what's left n minus one ever okay this

116
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,340
is what it is okay so with this equation

117
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,680
we can implement this using this

118
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,900
recursion or iterative now with the

119
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,979
recursion we can just easily write the

120
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,440
something like that Define C and M and

121
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:19,400
then Define the boundary if and equal

122
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:23,340
equals zero will be ten one

123
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,039
if m equal equal n we turn one right or

124
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,280
if n equals zero or m equal and we can

125
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,720
one then return

126
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,960
see

127
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:39,180
n minus 1 M plus C and minus 1 and -1 we

128
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,419
can remember the intermediate values by

129
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,240
minimization putting up cash

130
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:49,860
AI you catch this reason we use cash

131
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,560
from function tools import AIU cache Max

132
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,419
size equals nine this is the

133
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,400
minimization top-down dynamic

134
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:59,940
programming the other way to implement

135
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,120
it is to use the iterative functions so

136
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:05,400
we can initialize the two dimensional

137
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,979
arrays and then we go through this row

138
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,000
by row it's basically to clearly with a

139
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:14,699
pascal triangle so from math we can

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,039
import com function which calculates

141
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:21,539
this value column

142
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:24,060
for two it will give us 6 and another

143
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:27,479
similar function which actually Returns

144
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,919
the combination itself is from ether to

145
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,039
a

146
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,979
import

147
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:37,979
combination okay combinations so how do

148
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:40,979
we use it so combinations

149
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,979
combinations

150
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,819
the first one is the iterator right so

151
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:51,180
we can pass it one two three four a

152
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:54,960
second is the number of items to choose

153
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:59,340
basically says that give us the solution

154
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,699
of picking two items from this iterator

155
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,680
so it will return a list of combinations

156
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,360
so it will be one two

157
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,080
one three

158
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,759
one four two two three two four three

159
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,220
four okay

160
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,259
we can compute this value right this

161
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,960
value using mathematics this one right

162
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:21,960
this is also okay and we can calculate

163
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,819
this value based on this function based

164
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,940
on this formula instead of this formula

165
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,639
okay so this is the combination okay so

166
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:33,300
you know in the next World Cup instead

167
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:37,919
of 32 teams there's going to be 60 40

168
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:40,800
18s 16 more so 48 teams

169
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,240
let how many girls how many goals 48 if

170
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,920
each group has four teams how many

171
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,360
groups 40 18 12 yeah 12 12. so okay so

172
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,880
applying this

173
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,980
right so we just have to change this to

174
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,399
12 12.

175
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,200
but after group stage how many teams are

176
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,339
left 24 right

177
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,760
so we need to play 23 more

178
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:09,959
to eliminate right and plus one right so

179
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,920
it's uh 48 plus 33 plus one right so

180
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:19,800
what's this 72 plus 23 Plus 1.

181
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:22,800
what's this 75 and 95 95 96 96 okay if

182
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,880
my math is correct if the next workout

183
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:31,440
has 48 teams and there are 12 groups

184
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,360
right and 12 times 6 equals 72. this is

185
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,660
the number of match that play in the

186
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,080
group stage and after that you know each

187
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,660
knockout match eliminates one so it

188
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,720
needs the 23 to animate

189
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,940
23 teams right and then we have one more

190
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,660
to decide who is going to be the third

191
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,660
place all right

192
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,720
I mean matches they are C two four about

193
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,500
how many matches are in the World Cup

194
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:08,100
okay so what's the answer 64. 64. okay

195
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:13,399
so how do we get a 64. so we see two

196
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,399
four times the number of

197
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,570
[Music]

198
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,720
um

199
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,360
and in The Knockout stages

200
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,120
one we play a match we eliminate one

201
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,980
right and there's one X or more which is

202
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,920
to decide who is going to be the third

203
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,800
person okay so it's around about how

204
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,220
like the World Cup actually works like

205
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,899
how it matches oh how to do that and how

206
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,660
much matches they are

207
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:01,880
if there's 32 teams

208
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:07,440
if there's 32 well kind of countries

209
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:10,260
playing then then there will be 64.

210
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,420
each one is split into groups and then

211
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,320
the groups and then we do the

212
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:19,260
combination two out of four

213
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,079
like I said there and then how much

214
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,200
groups there are and then we have half

215
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,500
of it minus one plus that and then Plus

216
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,300
One will go to combine a bit further

217
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,560
than before

218
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,500
yes

219
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,500
okay that's it for today bye bye bye
