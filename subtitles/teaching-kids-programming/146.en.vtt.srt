by seven one and itself yeah that's one
 

17
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,550
by seven one and itself yeah that's one
number one

18
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,560
number one
 

19
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,189
number one
okay so can you give me the one is not a

20
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
okay so can you give me the one is not a
 

21
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:19,590
okay so can you give me the one is not a
prime

22
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
prime
 

23
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,830
prime
prime is not pro one is not prime number

24
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
prime is not pro one is not prime number
 

25
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,950
prime is not pro one is not prime number
can you give me the

26
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:22,960
can you give me the
 

27
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,630
can you give me the
smallest prime number okay so we are

28
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
smallest prime number okay so we are
 

29
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,150
smallest prime number okay so we are
talking about positive

30
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
talking about positive
 

31
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,150
talking about positive
nothing negative one is not this two is

32
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,160
nothing negative one is not this two is
 

33
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,350
nothing negative one is not this two is
the smallest

34
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
the smallest
 

35
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,790
the smallest
point number so two in the one table

36
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
point number so two in the one table
 

37
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,709
point number so two in the one table
yeah okay so what what number

38
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
yeah okay so what what number
 

39
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,150
yeah okay so what what number
are even numbers how many even numbers

40
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
are even numbers how many even numbers
 

41
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,270
are even numbers how many even numbers
there are prime numbers

42
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
there are prime numbers
 

43
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,389
there are prime numbers
one what is that two yeah that's a very

44
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
one what is that two yeah that's a very
 

45
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,270
one what is that two yeah that's a very
special case that's

46
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,280
special case that's
 

47
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,990
special case that's
the only even number that is the prime

48
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000
the only even number that is the prime
 

49
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,830
the only even number that is the prime
number all other even numbers are not

50
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
number all other even numbers are not
 

51
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,229
number all other even numbers are not
right

52
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
right
 

53
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,350
right
remember that okay so do you know do you

54
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
remember that okay so do you know do you
 

55
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,709
remember that okay so do you know do you
still remember how we're checking the

56
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
still remember how we're checking the
 

57
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,229
still remember how we're checking the
prime numbers

58
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
prime numbers
 

59
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,430
prime numbers
we are for example like 10

60
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
we are for example like 10
 

61
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,789
we are for example like 10
result for a number if it's

62
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
result for a number if it's
 

63
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,950
result for a number if it's
no it's no prime number you can go in

64
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
no it's no prime number you can go in
 

65
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,230
no it's no prime number you can go in
five or two

66
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
five or two
 

67
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,230
five or two
as i say it's even number it's not from

68
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
as i say it's even number it's not from
 

69
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,830
as i say it's even number it's not from
l if it's an

70
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
l if it's an
 

71
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,950
l if it's an
even number yeah it isn't to

72
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960
even number yeah it isn't to
 

73
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,310
even number yeah it isn't to
return yes and other even numbers no

74
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
return yes and other even numbers no
 

75
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,190
return yes and other even numbers no
okay okay so given the number n how do

76
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
okay okay so given the number n how do
 

77
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,149
okay okay so given the number n how do
we check it with the

78
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
we check it with the
 

79
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,310
we check it with the
prime number or not

80
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320

 

81
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,510

n is any number any number i mean for

82
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
n is any number any number i mean for
 

83
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,710
n is any number any number i mean for
example like a

84
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
example like a
 

85
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,510
example like a
given number a number integer n and how

86
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
given number a number integer n and how
 

87
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,830
given number a number integer n and how
do we check with the prime number

88
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
do we check with the prime number
 

89
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,749
do we check with the prime number
we can't write that

90
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
we can't write that
 

91
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,590
we can't write that
divide it by 2 and divide by 3 and

92
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
divide it by 2 and divide by 3 and
 

93
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,550
divide it by 2 and divide by 3 and
divided by

94
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
divided by
 

95
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,510
divided by
4 divided by 5. okay actually we don't

96
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
4 divided by 5. okay actually we don't
 

97
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,789
4 divided by 5. okay actually we don't
need to check if we

98
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
need to check if we
 

99
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,109
need to check if we
by the even number because 2 right if

100
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
by the even number because 2 right if
 

101
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,510
by the even number because 2 right if
it's even number we just cross out right

102
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
it's even number we just cross out right
 

103
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,190
it's even number we just cross out right
right yeah i know we start with three

104
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
right yeah i know we start with three
 

105
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,590
right yeah i know we start with three
yeah it's three it can be divided by

106
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
yeah it's three it can be divided by
 

107
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,789
yeah it's three it can be divided by
three

108
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
three
 

109
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,030
three
if no we check the five right we don't

110
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
if no we check the five right we don't
 

111
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,389
if no we check the five right we don't
need to check the four right

112
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
need to check the four right
 

113
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,990
need to check the four right
yeah because it can be divided by four

114
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
yeah because it can be divided by four
 

115
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,830
yeah because it can be divided by four
it can also be divided by two m right

116
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
it can also be divided by two m right
 

117
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,270
it can also be divided by two m right
yeah yeah because it's in uh because

118
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
yeah yeah because it's in uh because
 

119
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,670
yeah yeah because it's in uh because
we just check if it's uh it can be

120
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
we just check if it's uh it can be
 

121
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,430
we just check if it's uh it can be
divided by two one all right

122
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
divided by two one all right
 

123
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,270
divided by two one all right
okay so and how many which number the

124
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
okay so and how many which number the
 

125
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,270
okay so and how many which number the
maxima we are going to check

126
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
maxima we are going to check
 

127
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,589
maxima we are going to check
like if it's a hundred how uh what

128
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
like if it's a hundred how uh what
 

129
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,510
like if it's a hundred how uh what
number

130
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
number
 

131
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,550
number
i think 97 is the biggest i know i mean

132
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
i think 97 is the biggest i know i mean
 

133
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,750
i think 97 is the biggest i know i mean
i

134
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
i
 

135
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,150
i
what i mean is 100 and then which number

136
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
what i mean is 100 and then which number
 

137
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,830
what i mean is 100 and then which number
the maxima i need to check if it can be

138
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
the maxima i need to check if it can be
 

139
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,390
the maxima i need to check if it can be
divided by

140
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
divided by
 

141
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,430
divided by
i'll give you trillions okay

142
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,440
i'll give you trillions okay
 

143
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,030
i'll give you trillions okay
99 50

144
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
99 50
 

145
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,710
99 50
10 what do you mean so i need to check

146
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
10 what do you mean so i need to check
 

147
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,509
10 what do you mean so i need to check
that like

148
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
that like
 

149
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,470
that like
three it can be divided by three five as

150
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
three it can be divided by three five as
 

151
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,030
three it can be divided by three five as
i said

152
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
i said
 

153
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,630
i said
two i need to check the two but i don't

154
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
two i need to check the two but i don't
 

155
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,630
two i need to check the two but i don't
need to check if it could be divided by

156
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
need to check if it could be divided by
 

157
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,670
need to check if it could be divided by
four right

158
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
four right
 

159
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,949
four right
seven nine eleven you know

160
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:58,959
seven nine eleven you know
 

161
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,990
seven nine eleven you know
up to ten fifty or ninety nine

162
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
up to ten fifty or ninety nine
 

163
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,430
up to ten fifty or ninety nine
doesn't make sense yeah

164
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
doesn't make sense yeah
 

165
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,149
doesn't make sense yeah
so we should pick one

166
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159

 

167
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,790

i don't really know what you mean okay

168
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
i don't really know what you mean okay
 

169
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,589
i don't really know what you mean okay
so for example

170
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
so for example
 

171
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,309
so for example
100 normally if you want to find out if

172
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
100 normally if you want to find out if
 

173
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:18,710
100 normally if you want to find out if
it's in

174
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
it's in
 

175
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,790
it's in
one times table or a hundred times but

176
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
one times table or a hundred times but
 

177
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,550
one times table or a hundred times but
it's always true right

178
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
it's always true right
 

179
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,270
it's always true right
then there's nothing between one and a

180
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
then there's nothing between one and a
 

181
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,710
then there's nothing between one and a
hundred that can be divided by

182
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
hundred that can be divided by
 

183
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,869
hundred that can be divided by
a hundred right then it's a prime number

184
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
a hundred right then it's a prime number
 

185
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,990
a hundred right then it's a prime number
all right

186
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
all right
 

187
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,670
all right
yeah and we need to check into the

188
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
yeah and we need to check into the
 

189
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,670
yeah and we need to check into the
number can be divided by

190
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
number can be divided by
 

191
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,030
number can be divided by
uh a hundred in between the two and

192
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
uh a hundred in between the two and
 

193
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,710
uh a hundred in between the two and
between one and a hundred doesn't make

194
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
between one and a hundred doesn't make
 

195
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,430
between one and a hundred doesn't make
sense that's the equilibrium to check

196
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
sense that's the equilibrium to check
 

197
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,390
sense that's the equilibrium to check
right

198
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
right
 

199
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,110
right
for example like 97 you're saying 97 is

200
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
for example like 97 you're saying 97 is
 

201
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,190
for example like 97 you're saying 97 is
the largest point number under 100

202
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
the largest point number under 100
 

203
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,470
the largest point number under 100
9 is no prime number i know but but

204
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
9 is no prime number i know but but
 

205
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,830
9 is no prime number i know but but
how do you know 97 because we are trying

206
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840

 

207
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,490

2.99

208
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:00,500
2.99
 

209
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,309
2.99
[Music]

210
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
[Music]
 

211
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,869
[Music]
yeah but look we suppose we don't know

212
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
yeah but look we suppose we don't know
 

213
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,630
yeah but look we suppose we don't know
97 is the point number right

214
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
97 is the point number right
 

215
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,869
97 is the point number right
okay then then we need to check any

216
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
okay then then we need to check any
 

217
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,949
okay then then we need to check any
numbers from two we need to check two

218
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
numbers from two we need to check two
 

219
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,149
numbers from two we need to check two
three four five to see if they that's

220
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
three four five to see if they that's
 

221
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,789
three four five to see if they that's
eight

222
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
eight
 

223
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,310
eight
yeah because to see if ninety seven yeah

224
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
yeah because to see if ninety seven yeah
 

225
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,949
yeah because to see if ninety seven yeah
yeah i know i know so so the thing is

226
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
yeah i know i know so so the thing is
 

227
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,150
yeah i know i know so so the thing is
how many numbers can we

228
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
how many numbers can we
 

229
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,030
how many numbers can we
we we need to check given this number is

230
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
we we need to check given this number is
 

231
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,510
we we need to check given this number is
n

232
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
n
 

233
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,910
n
we need

234
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:28,920
we need
 

235
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,749
we need
[Music]

236
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759

 

237
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,590

okay so you still don't get my point

238
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
okay so you still don't get my point
 

239
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,909
okay so you still don't get my point
right do you

240
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
right do you
 

241
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,710
right do you
i'm saying that this is number 97 so we

242
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
i'm saying that this is number 97 so we
 

243
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,510
i'm saying that this is number 97 so we
need to check

244
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
need to check
 

245
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,830
need to check
as uh if we don't know right we need to

246
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
as uh if we don't know right we need to
 

247
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,870
as uh if we don't know right we need to
check the number two

248
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
check the number two
 

249
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,270
check the number two
three four five okay six seven eight

250
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
three four five okay six seven eight
 

251
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,950
three four five okay six seven eight
nine ten

252
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
nine ten
 

253
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,270
nine ten
and year two ninety seven that until

254
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
and year two ninety seven that until
 

255
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,710
and year two ninety seven that until
ninety six that's a

256
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
ninety six that's a
 

257
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,030
ninety six that's a
one solution right we check every number

258
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
one solution right we check every number
 

259
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,830
one solution right we check every number
between

260
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
between
 

261
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,110
between
two and m m right to see

262
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
two and m m right to see
 

263
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,790
two and m m right to see
if it can be divided right if it can be

264
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
if it can be divided right if it can be
 

265
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,870
if it can be divided right if it can be
divided it's not a prime number right

266
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
divided it's not a prime number right
 

267
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,749
divided it's not a prime number right
doesn't make sense yeah okay so what i'm

268
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
doesn't make sense yeah okay so what i'm
 

269
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,469
doesn't make sense yeah okay so what i'm
asking is

270
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
asking is
 

271
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,310
asking is
if you remember

272
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320

 

273
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,469

that's right yeah so so certainly not

274
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
that's right yeah so so certainly not
 

275
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,150
that's right yeah so so certainly not
this one right if a hundred

276
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
this one right if a hundred
 

277
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,830
this one right if a hundred
yeah because it's more than half we

278
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
yeah because it's more than half we
 

279
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,510
yeah because it's more than half we
don't need to share right it cannot be

280
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
don't need to share right it cannot be
 

281
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,990
don't need to share right it cannot be
divided that's what i'm asking okay okay

282
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
divided that's what i'm asking okay okay
 

283
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,749
divided that's what i'm asking okay okay
so you're saying this

284
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759

 

285
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,150

100 certainly not 99 because it's too

286
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
100 certainly not 99 because it's too
 

287
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,749
100 certainly not 99 because it's too
much right

288
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
much right
 

289
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,550
much right
50 you say because over half is comfy

290
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
50 you say because over half is comfy
 

291
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,830
50 you say because over half is comfy
divided right

292
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
divided right
 

293
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,990
divided right
right

294
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000

 

295
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,710

yeah that's one good yeah that's the one

296
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
yeah that's one good yeah that's the one
 

297
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,510
yeah that's one good yeah that's the one
solution

298
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
solution
 

299
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,790
solution
but how about i'm telling you is 10

300
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
but how about i'm telling you is 10
 

301
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,550
but how about i'm telling you is 10
is that 10 is the square root of 100

302
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
is that 10 is the square root of 100
 

303
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,029
is that 10 is the square root of 100
why is that because look if two number

304
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
why is that because look if two number
 

305
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,230
why is that because look if two number
if you find the number

306
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
if you find the number
 

307
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,390
if you find the number
100 yeah if you find the number two

308
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
100 yeah if you find the number two
 

309
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,670
100 yeah if you find the number two
right

310
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
right
 

311
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,029
right
yeah this is this is a

312
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
yeah this is this is a
 

313
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,309
yeah this is this is a
right right it must be

314
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
right right it must be
 

315
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,629
right right it must be
a number which is a 100 divided by 8

316
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
a number which is a 100 divided by 8
 

317
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,790
a number which is a 100 divided by 8
which is 50 right

318
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
which is 50 right
 

319
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,150
which is 50 right
if it is 5 this is a that must be

320
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
if it is 5 this is a that must be
 

321
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,110
if it is 5 this is a that must be
100 divided by a which is 20. does it

322
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
100 divided by a which is 20. does it
 

323
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,749
100 divided by a which is 20. does it
make sense

324
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
make sense
 

325
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,270
make sense
so you always come with pair if it can

326
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
so you always come with pair if it can
 

327
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,469
so you always come with pair if it can
be divided right all right

328
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
be divided right all right
 

329
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,390
be divided right all right
four okay what's the other pair

330
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400

 

331
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,590

oh 25 yes yes you see so

332
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
oh 25 yes yes you see so
 

333
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,230
oh 25 yes yes you see so
you always come with pair and here 10

334
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
you always come with pair and here 10
 

335
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,350
you always come with pair and here 10
right because everything

336
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
right because everything
 

337
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,029
right because everything
up to look 10 10 times 10 equals 100

338
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
up to look 10 10 times 10 equals 100
 

339
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,029
up to look 10 10 times 10 equals 100
right and then you go to the next which

340
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
right and then you go to the next which
 

341
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,230
right and then you go to the next which
is 20

342
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
is 20
 

343
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,749
is 20
20 we know because when we we go to 20

344
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
20 we know because when we we go to 20
 

345
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,870
20 we know because when we we go to 20
we know already in the five

346
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
we know already in the five
 

347
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,950
we know already in the five
right yeah does it make sense

348
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
right yeah does it make sense
 

349
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,830
right yeah does it make sense
yeah two numbers comes together equals

350
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
yeah two numbers comes together equals
 

351
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,469
yeah two numbers comes together equals
100

352
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
100
 

353
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,870
100
10 and 10 right if you increase one

354
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
10 and 10 right if you increase one
 

355
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,550
10 and 10 right if you increase one
number the other one needs to be lower

356
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
number the other one needs to be lower
 

357
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,270
number the other one needs to be lower
down right

358
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
down right
 

359
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,070
down right
if 10 goes to 20 and the other ten needs

360
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
if 10 goes to 20 and the other ten needs
 

361
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,510
if 10 goes to 20 and the other ten needs
to go to the one

362
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
to go to the one
 

363
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,350
to go to the one
five all right if these ten go to twenty

364
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
five all right if these ten go to twenty
 

365
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,909
five all right if these ten go to twenty
five

366
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
five
 

367
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,950
five
at least ten needs to go say this one is

368
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
at least ten needs to go say this one is
 

369
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,510
at least ten needs to go say this one is
this one double this one

370
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
this one double this one
 

371
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,670
this one double this one
huh so that's what i'm saying it's

372
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
huh so that's what i'm saying it's
 

373
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,510
huh so that's what i'm saying it's
always come in half so

374
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
always come in half so
 

375
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,589
always come in half so
it means we just need to check the

376
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
it means we just need to check the
 

377
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,070
it means we just need to check the
number up to square root of n

378
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
number up to square root of n
 

379
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,070
number up to square root of n
right so which one is faster

380
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080

 

381
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,510

which one is faster you're saying half i

382
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
which one is faster you're saying half i
 

383
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,430
which one is faster you're saying half i
i'm saying square root so which one is

384
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
i'm saying square root so which one is
 

385
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,510
i'm saying square root so which one is
faster obviously which one

386
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
faster obviously which one
 

387
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,029
faster obviously which one
pick one yeah of course 100 this is 50.

388
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
pick one yeah of course 100 this is 50.
 

389
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,990
pick one yeah of course 100 this is 50.
this is 10.

390
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
this is 10.
 

391
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,909
this is 10.
i just need to check 10 times you need

392
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
i just need to check 10 times you need
 

393
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,350
i just need to check 10 times you need
to check 50 times

394
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
to check 50 times
 

395
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,710
to check 50 times
who is the winner daddy yeah okay so i'm

396
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
who is the winner daddy yeah okay so i'm
 

397
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,990
who is the winner daddy yeah okay so i'm
not going to write this

398
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
not going to write this
 

399
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,670
not going to write this
okay me i'm the winner so that's

400
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
okay me i'm the winner so that's
 

401
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,749
okay me i'm the winner so that's
the the time complexity of checking that

402
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
the the time complexity of checking that
 

403
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,530
the the time complexity of checking that
is what

404
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:54,540

 

405
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,830

[Music]

406
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
[Music]
 

407
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:10,950
[Music]
i

408
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960

 

409
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,990

and small equal than one we know

410
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
and small equal than one we know
 

411
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,670
and small equal than one we know
is what return one false

412
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
is what return one false
 

413
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,790
is what return one false
yeah false

414
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800

 

415
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,309

even if n is two return one let's say

416
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
even if n is two return one let's say
 

417
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,790
even if n is two return one let's say
it's a special case here

418
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
it's a special case here
 

419
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,950
it's a special case here
two come on two is the special prime

420
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
two come on two is the special prime
 

421
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,469
two come on two is the special prime
number you just said remember

422
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
number you just said remember
 

423
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,230
number you just said remember
yeah if n can be divided by two

424
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
yeah if n can be divided by two
 

425
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,990
yeah if n can be divided by two
return one folks yeah because because

426
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
return one folks yeah because because
 

427
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,909
return one folks yeah because because
because it's a even numbers right

428
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
because it's a even numbers right
 

429
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,710
because it's a even numbers right
be divided yeah because we just we just

430
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
be divided yeah because we just we just
 

431
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,230
be divided yeah because we just we just
have this special case for two

432
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
have this special case for two
 

433
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,630
have this special case for two
and all other even numbers we return

434
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
and all other even numbers we return
 

435
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,350
and all other even numbers we return
four because

436
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
four because
 

437
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,790
four because
obviously 100 200 104

438
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
obviously 100 200 104
 

439
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,750
obviously 100 200 104
uh not for numbers and now we just need

440
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
uh not for numbers and now we just need
 

441
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,389
uh not for numbers and now we just need
to check

442
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
to check
 

443
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,150
to check
i i equals 3 right yes

444
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
i i equals 3 right yes
 

445
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,670
i i equals 3 right yes
y i times i

446
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
y i times i
 

447
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,550
y i times i
smaller or equal n right because look

448
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
smaller or equal n right because look
 

449
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,750
smaller or equal n right because look
why why is this one

450
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
why why is this one
 

451
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,949
why why is this one
look why i times i smaller than equal n

452
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
look why i times i smaller than equal n
 

453
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,430
look why i times i smaller than equal n
right

454
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
right
 

455
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,350
right
i just said two numbers comes in

456
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
i just said two numbers comes in
 

457
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,110
i just said two numbers comes in
together ten times ten smaller than

458
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
together ten times ten smaller than
 

459
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,070
together ten times ten smaller than
hundred right

460
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
hundred right
 

461
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,190
hundred right
all right yeah yeah what do

462
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
all right yeah yeah what do
 

463
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,630
all right yeah yeah what do
if n can be divided by

464
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
if n can be divided by
 

465
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,310
if n can be divided by
i equals zero return one

466
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
i equals zero return one
 

467
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,470
i equals zero return one
represent one fourth yes

468
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
represent one fourth yes
 

469
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,670
represent one fourth yes
okay so now here i plus equal one

470
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
okay so now here i plus equal one
 

471
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,430
okay so now here i plus equal one
one or two

472
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440

 

473
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,949

uh now i'm three okay after checking

474
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
uh now i'm three okay after checking
 

475
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,269
uh now i'm three okay after checking
through

476
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
through
 

477
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,389
through
what's the next number to check

478
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
what's the next number to check
 

479
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,150
what's the next number to check
five five yeah because we don't want to

480
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
five five yeah because we don't want to
 

481
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,070
five five yeah because we don't want to
check for already we want to skip

482
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
check for already we want to skip
 

483
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,310
check for already we want to skip
even number we already check here right

484
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
even number we already check here right
 

485
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,070
even number we already check here right
yeah so i price equals

486
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
yeah so i price equals
 

487
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,110
yeah so i price equals
and return one if we go through this

488
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
and return one if we go through this
 

489
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,269
and return one if we go through this
written one this is return fourth after

490
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
written one this is return fourth after
 

491
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,870
written one this is return fourth after
the university cases

492
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
the university cases
 

493
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,750
the university cases
what will it take what should we do

494
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
what will it take what should we do
 

495
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,430
what will it take what should we do
we should tell you what after the checks

496
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
we should tell you what after the checks
 

497
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,590
we should tell you what after the checks
okay look lisa we're looking out for the

498
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
okay look lisa we're looking out for the
 

499
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,069
okay look lisa we're looking out for the
factors that can be divided by i yeah

500
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
factors that can be divided by i yeah
 

501
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,389
factors that can be divided by i yeah
it can be divided by 3 you can divide by

502
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
it can be divided by 3 you can divide by
 

503
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,110
it can be divided by 3 you can divide by
7

504
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
7
 

505
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,870
7
if i can't find anything that can be

506
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
if i can't find anything that can be
 

507
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,550
if i can't find anything that can be
divided by n what does it mean

508
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
divided by n what does it mean
 

509
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,590
divided by n what does it mean
j yeah it's a point number okay

510
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
j yeah it's a point number okay
 

511
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,750
j yeah it's a point number okay
does it make sense this is the agreement

512
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
does it make sense this is the agreement
 

513
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,110
does it make sense this is the agreement
to check if the number

514
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120

 

515
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,230

if t equals 2 does it make sense

516
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
if t equals 2 does it make sense
 

517
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,750
if t equals 2 does it make sense
if n look if n is 2 return 2 if n is

518
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
if n look if n is 2 return 2 if n is
 

519
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,030
if n look if n is 2 return 2 if n is
3 come here right

520
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
3 come here right
 

521
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,230
3 come here right
if n is 3 3 times three smaller than two

522
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
if n is 3 3 times three smaller than two
 

523
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,230
if n is 3 3 times three smaller than two
it won't go in there right return two

524
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
it won't go in there right return two
 

525
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,590
it won't go in there right return two
even hundred

526
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
even hundred
 

527
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,190
even hundred
answer 97 let's say 97

528
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
answer 97 let's say 97
 

529
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,389
answer 97 let's say 97
smaller than angular 1 return fourth no

530
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
smaller than angular 1 return fourth no
 

531
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,509
smaller than angular 1 return fourth no
two no even number no

532
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
two no even number no
 

533
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,509
two no even number no
i equal three three times three nine

534
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
i equal three three times three nine
 

535
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,790
i equal three three times three nine
smaller than ninety seven

536
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
smaller than ninety seven
 

537
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,710
smaller than ninety seven
yes if 97 can divide it by three

538
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
yes if 97 can divide it by three
 

539
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,110
yes if 97 can divide it by three
now and then let's check the next number

540
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
now and then let's check the next number
 

541
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,550
now and then let's check the next number
five

542
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
five
 

543
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,150
five
five times five is 197 yes and divided

544
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
five times five is 197 yes and divided
 

545
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,470
five times five is 197 yes and divided
by

546
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
by
 

547
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,509
by
five no and next number seven seven

548
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
five no and next number seven seven
 

549
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,550
five no and next number seven seven
times seven is more than

550
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
times seven is more than
 

551
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,710
times seven is more than
97 no the next one is nine times uh

552
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
97 no the next one is nine times uh
 

553
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,470
97 no the next one is nine times uh
nine times nine smaller than 97 yes

554
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
nine times nine smaller than 97 yes
 

555
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,990
nine times nine smaller than 97 yes
and 97 can be divided by seven no

556
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
and 97 can be divided by seven no
 

557
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,190
and 97 can be divided by seven no
and next number eleven then eleven times

558
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
and next number eleven then eleven times
 

559
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,310
and next number eleven then eleven times
eleven is bigger than ninety-seven then

560
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
eleven is bigger than ninety-seven then
 

561
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,389
eleven is bigger than ninety-seven then
we return true we don't come in here

562
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
we return true we don't come in here
 

563

numbers
 

573
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,990
numbers
that are no bigger than three so three

574
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
that are no bigger than three so three
 

575
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,110
that are no bigger than three so three
you'll give me a list two and three

576
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
you'll give me a list two and three
 

577

so what's your approach it's it's one
step forward yeah

614
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
step forward yeah
 

615
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,629
step forward yeah
so so basically check all the numbers up

616
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
so so basically check all the numbers up
 

617
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,990
so so basically check all the numbers up
to n right to check

618
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
to n right to check
 

619
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,590
to n right to check
each one in this point number and we'll

620
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
each one in this point number and we'll
 

621
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,509
each one in this point number and we'll
push it into the into the

622
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
push it into the into the
 

623
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,269
push it into the into the
list yeah so you'll be simple like that

624
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
list yeah so you'll be simple like that

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,949
look you can say return
all right return bracket

656
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
all right return bracket
 

657
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,150
all right return bracket
yeah x x book

658
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
yeah x x book
 

659
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,350
yeah x x book
four x in range

660
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
four x in range
 

661
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,590
four x in range
you can do it in one line range start

662
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
you can do it in one line range start
 

663
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,670
you can do it in one line range start
with two and plus one

664
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
with two and plus one
 

665
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,269
with two and plus one
and then to what if it's one

666
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
and then to what if it's one
 

667
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,590
and then to what if it's one
yeah this is a fancy way of writing it

668
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:49,600
yeah this is a fancy way of writing it
 

669
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,790
yeah this is a fancy way of writing it
it's the same

670
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
it's the same
 

671
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,829
it's the same
uh x i know bad thing look at

672
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
uh x i know bad thing look at
 

673
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,389
uh x i know bad thing look at
the imagine we take that yeah this is

674
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
the imagine we take that yeah this is
 

675
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,750
the imagine we take that yeah this is
the traditional way though

676
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
the traditional way though
 

677
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,069
the traditional way though
yeah this is a traditional way of doing

678
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
yeah this is a traditional way of doing
 

679
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,829
yeah this is a traditional way of doing
right but we can write it return i want

680
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
right but we can write it return i want
 

681
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,189
right but we can write it return i want
to return what a bracket

682
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
to return what a bracket
 

683
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,710
to return what a bracket
which is the least what kind of this

684
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
which is the least what kind of this
 

685
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,870
which is the least what kind of this
return x contained as y o t

686
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
return x contained as y o t
 

687
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,590
return x contained as y o t
what's as x is in the range of 2 to n

688
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
what's as x is in the range of 2 to n
 

689
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,310
what's as x is in the range of 2 to n
plus 1.

690
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
plus 1.
 

691
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,189
plus 1.
additional condition is if a square is x

692
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
additional condition is if a square is x
 

693
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:13,750
additional condition is if a square is x
yeah

694
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
yeah
 

695
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,230
yeah
does it make sense yeah this is called

696
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
does it make sense yeah this is called
 

697
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,590
does it make sense yeah this is called
this comprehension

698
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600
this comprehension
 

699
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,230
this comprehension
comprehension in python coming together

700
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
comprehension in python coming together
 

701
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,710
comprehension in python coming together
all of

702
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
all of
 

703
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,670
all of
these things look at this is always

704
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
these things look at this is always
 

705
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,389
these things look at this is always
right

706
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
right
 

707
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,509
right
yeah all right this is our loop and

708
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
yeah all right this is our loop and
 

709
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,829
yeah all right this is our loop and
combining with

710
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:29,839
combining with
 

711
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,949
combining with
o square n so the overall complexity is

712
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
o square n so the overall complexity is
 

713
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,710
o square n so the overall complexity is
o and square n right doesn't make sense

714
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720
o and square n right doesn't make sense
 

715
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,829
o and square n right doesn't make sense
all right look iterate anytime and for

716
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:39,839
all right look iterate anytime and for
 

717
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,350
all right look iterate anytime and for
each one you need to iterate

718
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
each one you need to iterate
 

719
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,910
each one you need to iterate
square root and right so also again

720
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
square root and right so also again
 

721
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,550
square root and right so also again
combined

722
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
combined
 

723
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,590
combined
right because this thing this thing is

724
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
right because this thing this thing is
 

725
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,710
right because this thing this thing is
inside the loop right this makes sense

726
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
inside the loop right this makes sense
 

727
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,550
inside the loop right this makes sense
if you want to complete these tasks you

728
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
if you want to complete these tasks you
 

729
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,310
if you want to complete these tasks you
need to do this n times for each end

730
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
need to do this n times for each end
 

731
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,430
need to do this n times for each end
time you need to do this

732
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
time you need to do this
 

733
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,910
time you need to do this
square row and time so comes together

734
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:57,920
square row and time so comes together
 

735
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,910
square row and time so comes together
multiply together is one square

736
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
multiply together is one square
 

737
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,150
multiply together is one square
can we do better wait we can

738
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160

 

739
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,110

can we do better yes of course okay so

740
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
can we do better yes of course okay so
 

741
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,710
can we do better yes of course okay so
what's your approach

742
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
what's your approach
 

743
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,750
what's your approach
what's your approach you don't any

744
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
what's your approach you don't any
 

745
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,670
what's your approach you don't any
okay that's fine that's right so we

746
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
okay that's fine that's right so we
 

747
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,509
okay that's fine that's right so we
we're talking about another new problem

748
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519
we're talking about another new problem
 

749
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,069
we're talking about another new problem
which is

750
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
which is
 

751
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,910
which is
more efficient in this case it's called

752
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:18,920
more efficient in this case it's called
 

753
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,110
more efficient in this case it's called
s-i-e-b-e-c

754
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
s-i-e-b-e-c
 

755
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,829
s-i-e-b-e-c
something but you can just conceive

756
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:24,839
something but you can just conceive
 

757
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,150
something but you can just conceive
everything

758
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
everything
 

759
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,269
everything
this is actually

760
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279

 

761
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,470

okay so yeah okay let's look so how can

762
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
okay so yeah okay let's look so how can
 

763
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,550
okay so yeah okay let's look so how can
we generate

764
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
we generate
 

765
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,350
we generate
the the numbers more efficiently right

766
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
the the numbers more efficiently right
 

767
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,870
the the numbers more efficiently right
because for the previously we need to

768
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
because for the previously we need to
 

769
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,389
because for the previously we need to
check each number right

770
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
check each number right
 

771
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,749
check each number right
there's no way to skip it right so

772
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759
there's no way to skip it right so
 

773
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,350
there's no way to skip it right so
you get a

774
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360

 

775
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,430

what okay so so you put two in it first

776
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
what okay so so you put two in it first
 

777
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,110
what okay so so you put two in it first
yeah and you check everyone not me

778
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
yeah and you check everyone not me
 

779
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,749
yeah and you check everyone not me
not the other even numbers and not over

780
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759
not the other even numbers and not over
 

781
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,949
not the other even numbers and not over
half

782
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
half
 

783
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,269
half
no and over half i mean they're the

784
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279
no and over half i mean they're the
 

785
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,230
no and over half i mean they're the
biggie

786
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
biggie
 

787
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,790
biggie
and not not the other even numbers you

788
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
and not not the other even numbers you
 

789
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,269
and not not the other even numbers you
are

790
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:07,279
are
 

791
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,030
are
a little bit close but not too quiet

792
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
a little bit close but not too quiet
 

793
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,509
a little bit close but not too quiet
okay why okay so i'm telling you look

794
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
okay why okay so i'm telling you look
 

795
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,670
okay why okay so i'm telling you look
so look let's say i want to generate all

796
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
so look let's say i want to generate all
 

797
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,509
so look let's say i want to generate all
the numbers under 20 prime numbers

798
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
the numbers under 20 prime numbers
 

799
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,310
the numbers under 20 prime numbers
okay all right so we know

800
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
okay all right so we know
 

801
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,350
okay all right so we know
we know one is not right we start with

802
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
we know one is not right we start with
 

803
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:23,990
we know one is not right we start with
two okay

804
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
two okay
 

805
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,269
two okay

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,269
the
the prime numbers we want to generate

820
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
the prime numbers we want to generate
 

821
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,110
the prime numbers we want to generate
all the parameters under 20 right

822
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
all the parameters under 20 right
 

823
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,430
all the parameters under 20 right
yeah so we start with 2 2 is the prime

824
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
yeah so we start with 2 2 is the prime
 

825
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,230
yeah so we start with 2 2 is the prime
number yeah

826
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
number yeah
 

827
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,629
number yeah
yeah of course so we set everything to

828
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:52,639
yeah of course so we set everything to
 

829
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,350
yeah of course so we set everything to
two we

830
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
two we
 

831
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,269
two we
we we just assume every number is the

832
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:55,279
we we just assume every number is the
 

833
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,710
we we just assume every number is the
prime number okay

834
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
prime number okay
 

835
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,790
prime number okay
okay for now okay so first so you

836
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
okay for now okay so first so you
 

837
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,110
okay for now okay so first so you
you cross out all of the even numbers

838
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
you cross out all of the even numbers
 

839
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,630
you cross out all of the even numbers
except from 10.

840
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
except from 10.
 

841
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,590
except from 10.
we're down let let's whoa how do you

842
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,600
we're down let let's whoa how do you
 

843
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,189
we're down let let's whoa how do you
know yeah that's what i'm saying yeah

844
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
know yeah that's what i'm saying yeah
 

845
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,150
know yeah that's what i'm saying yeah
two

846
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,160
two
 

847
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,789
two
i and i crossed every multiple of two so

848
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
i and i crossed every multiple of two so
 

849
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,829
i and i crossed every multiple of two so
which two is

850
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:13,839
which two is
 

851
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,470
which two is
four is not six is enough every two yeah

852
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
four is not six is enough every two yeah
 

853
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,829
four is not six is enough every two yeah
okay okay now i cross halfway

854
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
okay okay now i cross halfway
 

855
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,549
okay okay now i cross halfway
okay now i move to the next point number

856
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
okay now i move to the next point number
 

857
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,590
okay now i move to the next point number
three

858
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
three
 

859
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,909
three
and i cross out every possibility of

860
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
and i cross out every possibility of
 

861
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,750
and i cross out every possibility of
three multiple three

862
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
three multiple three
 

863
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,830
three multiple three
six nine twelve already crossover

864
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
six nine twelve already crossover
 

865
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,870
six nine twelve already crossover
fifteen eighteen

866
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
fifteen eighteen
 

867
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,710
fifteen eighteen
okay that's it and i go to next point

868
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
okay that's it and i go to next point
 

869
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,310
okay that's it and i go to next point
number which is five

870
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
number which is five
 

871
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,510
number which is five
and i cross out every multiple of five

872
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520
and i cross out every multiple of five
 

873
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:51,350
and i cross out every multiple of five
now they're all closed ten

874
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360

 

875
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,789

okay seven and seven fourteen yeah

876
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
okay seven and seven fourteen yeah
 

877
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,549
okay seven and seven fourteen yeah
and then eleven it's awesome yeah

878
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
and then eleven it's awesome yeah
 

879
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,990
and then eleven it's awesome yeah
so these all the rest you see

880
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000

 

881
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,710

you see this is more this is efficient

882
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
you see this is more this is efficient
 

883
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,150
you see this is more this is efficient
right y needs to work

884
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
right y needs to work
 

885
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,590
right y needs to work
right because every time i have a prime

886
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600
right because every time i have a prime
 

887
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,070
right because every time i have a prime
number it's multiple it's not a problem

888
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
number it's multiple it's not a problem
 

889
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,430
number it's multiple it's not a problem
right yeah all right and then remember

890
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:15,440
right yeah all right and then remember
 

891
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,310
right yeah all right and then remember
if we keep

892
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
if we keep
 

893
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,789
if we keep
doing this we the remaining is the prime

894
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
doing this we the remaining is the prime
 

895
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,470
doing this we the remaining is the prime
is are the prime numbers right

896
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:20,480
is are the prime numbers right
 

897
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,950
is are the prime numbers right
so then you need to go over here

898
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
so then you need to go over here
 

899
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,070
so then you need to go over here
because uh you know yeah

900
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
because uh you know yeah
 

901
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,750
because uh you know yeah
yeah yeah because we don't need to go to

902
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
yeah yeah because we don't need to go to
 

903
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,270
yeah yeah because we don't need to go to
the half right what's the complexity of

904
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
the half right what's the complexity of
 

905
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,789
the half right what's the complexity of
this one

906
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:36,799

 

907
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,029

is that enough time yeah of course this

908
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:39,039
is that enough time yeah of course this
 

909
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,789
is that enough time yeah of course this
complexity is our end right because we

910
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:40,799
complexity is our end right because we
 

911
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,750
complexity is our end right because we
need to go through

912
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
need to go through
 

913
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,909
need to go through
we need to possibly cross out numbers

914
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
we need to possibly cross out numbers
 

915
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,029
we need to possibly cross out numbers
yeah all right

916
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
yeah all right
 

917
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,270
yeah all right
but not less than that yeah yeah okay

918
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
but not less than that yeah yeah okay
 

919
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,150
but not less than that yeah yeah okay
let's do this

920
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
let's do this
 

921
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,350
let's do this
okay this is far better when we want to

922
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
okay this is far better when we want to
 

923
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,390
okay this is far better when we want to
know

924
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
know
 

925
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,630
know
we want to know uh list of prime numbers

926
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:56,640
we want to know uh list of prime numbers
 

927
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,390
we want to know uh list of prime numbers
under range right because we can keep

928
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
under range right because we can keep
 

929
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,990
under range right because we can keep
generating it right does it make sense

930
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
generating it right does it make sense
 

931
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,110
generating it right does it make sense
do you understand right

932
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
do you understand right
 

933
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,590
do you understand right
yeah it's easier it's fun yeah it's easy

934
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:03,600
yeah it's easier it's fun yeah it's easy
 

935
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,750
yeah it's easier it's fun yeah it's easy

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,549
yeah
okay now look let's say

946
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
okay now look let's say
 

947
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,669
okay now look let's say
uh let's say

948
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
uh let's say
 

949
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,830
uh let's say
the east one let's do this this one

950
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:27,840
the east one let's do this this one
 

951
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,590
the east one let's do this this one
array right equals at the beginning four

952
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
array right equals at the beginning four
 

953
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,750
array right equals at the beginning four
zero and one zero and one are not

954
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:35,760
zero and one zero and one are not
 

955
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,909
zero and one zero and one are not
zero and one are not prime numbers so i

956
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:37,919
zero and one are not prime numbers so i
 

957
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,870
zero and one are not prime numbers so i
times two right

958
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
times two right
 

959
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,350
times two right
and plus all others let's say it's all

960
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
and plus all others let's say it's all
 

961
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,150
and plus all others let's say it's all
prime numbers

962
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,160
prime numbers
 

963
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,470
prime numbers
two times a minus one right so all

964
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
two times a minus one right so all
 

965
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,470
two times a minus one right so all
together you'll be n plus one numbers

966
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480
together you'll be n plus one numbers
 

967
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,510
together you'll be n plus one numbers
i'm right

968
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:47,520
i'm right
 

969
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,710
i'm right
yeah zero to m n it will be n plus one

970
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
yeah zero to m n it will be n plus one
 

971
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,190
yeah zero to m n it will be n plus one
number

972
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
number
 

973
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,230
number
now now now what should we do

974
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
now now now what should we do
 

975
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,390
now now now what should we do
we should cross all the numbers right we

976
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
we should cross all the numbers right we
 

977
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,430
we should cross all the numbers right we
should start crossing

978
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
should start crossing
 

979
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,350
should start crossing
all the numbers let's say uh let's say

980
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,360
all the numbers let's say uh let's say
 

981
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,789
all the numbers let's say uh let's say
i will be equals to 2 right

982
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:06,799
i will be equals to 2 right
 

983
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,470
i will be equals to 2 right
yeah all right okay so now let's say

984
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:10,480
yeah all right okay so now let's say
 

985
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,310
yeah all right okay so now let's say
y well

986
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,320
y well
 

987
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,990
y well
i i times 2

988
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,000
i i times 2
 

989
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,029
i i times 2
right because if y times two i

990
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:21,039
right because if y times two i
 

991
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,110
right because if y times two i
times two smaller than n right smaller

992
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
times two smaller than n right smaller
 

993
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,070
times two smaller than n right smaller
or equal than n

994
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
or equal than n
 

995
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,870
or equal than n
right because when you passing me half

996
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
right because when you passing me half
 

997
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,990
right because when you passing me half
there's no point to

998
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,000
there's no point to
 

999
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,390
there's no point to
check the multiply right yeah as you say

1000
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
check the multiply right yeah as you say
 

1001
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,190
check the multiply right yeah as you say
you don't need

1002
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
you don't need
 

1003
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,190
you don't need
y i look if

1004
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
y i look if
 

1005
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,470
y i look if
if it's prime if it's a prime right

1006
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
if it's prime if it's a prime right
 

1007
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,390
if it's prime if it's a prime right
if it's a prime if currently it's a

1008
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
if it's a prime if currently it's a
 

1009
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,830
if it's a prime if currently it's a
prime number

1010
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:41,840
prime number
 

1011
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,789
prime number
column yeah then we need to mark

1012
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
column yeah then we need to mark
 

1013
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,789
column yeah then we need to mark
multiple of it so j

1014
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
multiple of it so j
 

1015
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,830
multiple of it so j
will be i plus i right

1016
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:49,840
will be i plus i right
 

1017
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,990
will be i plus i right
and then while j is smaller or equal

1018
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
and then while j is smaller or equal
 

1019
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,669
and then while j is smaller or equal
n and then we mark it as the fourth

1020
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
n and then we mark it as the fourth
 

1021
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,070
n and then we mark it as the fourth
right is prime

1022
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
right is prime
 

1023
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,750
right is prime
this prime j will be fourth right

1024
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:01,760
this prime j will be fourth right
 

1025
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,870
this prime j will be fourth right
all right and then j

1026
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
all right and then j
 

1027
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,070
all right and then j
plus equals i all right

1028
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080
plus equals i all right
 

1029
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,950
plus equals i all right
all right and if if it's not a prime

1030
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
all right and if if it's not a prime
 

1031
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,950
all right and if if it's not a prime
number what should we do we just simply

1032
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
number what should we do we just simply
 

1033
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,070
number what should we do we just simply
i plus equals one right

1034
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
i plus equals one right
 

1035
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,870
i plus equals one right
all right and after this if each prime

1036
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
all right and after this if each prime
 

1037
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,750
all right and after this if each prime
is true

1038
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
is true
 

1039
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,669
is true
then we know it's a polynomial so we can

1040
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
then we know it's a polynomial so we can
 

1041
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,270
then we know it's a polynomial so we can
do this return

1042
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,280
do this return
 

1043
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,870
do this return
and break it like the syntax

1044
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:26,880
and break it like the syntax
 

1045
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,149
and break it like the syntax
x for x in

1046
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
x for x in
 

1047
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,830
x for x in
range right yeah when you are

1048
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
range right yeah when you are
 

1049
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,870
range right yeah when you are
n plus one right

1050
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
n plus one right
 

1051
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,510
n plus one right
if or or you can put stuff with two we

1052
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
if or or you can put stuff with two we
 

1053
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:39,990
if or or you can put stuff with two we
know that

1054
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
know that
 

1055
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,750
know that
zero one is not right if what is prime

1056
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:43,760
zero one is not right if what is prime
 

1057
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,190
zero one is not right if what is prime
fun bracket x right we want to check i

1058
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,200
fun bracket x right we want to check i
 

1059
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,149
fun bracket x right we want to check i
yeah doesn't make sense look we start

1060
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:50,159
yeah doesn't make sense look we start
 

1061
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,070
yeah doesn't make sense look we start
with number two right all right

1062
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
with number two right all right
 

1063
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,430
with number two right all right
we start with the number two when i is

1064
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
we start with the number two when i is
 

1065
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,510
we start with the number two when i is
less than half right we want to find out

1066
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
less than half right we want to find out
 

1067
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,870
less than half right we want to find out
we want to find out if if it's a prime

1068
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
we want to find out if if it's a prime
 

1069
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,430
we want to find out if if it's a prime
number

1070
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440
number
 

1071
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,630
number
we start with 2 plus 2 which is 4 and we

1072
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
we start with 2 plus 2 which is 4 and we
 

1073
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,310
we start with 2 plus 2 which is 4 and we
cross out

1074
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,320
cross out
 

1075
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,230
cross out
every number which is 2 right so 4 six

1076
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
every number which is 2 right so 4 six
 

1077
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,669
every number which is 2 right so 4 six
eight right and here until it's j

1078
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:15,679
eight right and here until it's j
 

1079
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,710
eight right and here until it's j
is bigger than n right and if it's even

1080
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,720
is bigger than n right and if it's even
 

1081
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,950
is bigger than n right and if it's even
if it's not a prime number it means that

1082
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
if it's not a prime number it means that
 

1083
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,549
if it's not a prime number it means that
the number has been crossed so

1084
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
the number has been crossed so
 

1085
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,909
the number has been crossed so
we skip it we start so like next one we

1086
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:25,919
we skip it we start so like next one we
 

1087
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,510
we skip it we start so like next one we
find next part number and

1088
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
find next part number and
 

1089
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,390
find next part number and
cross our rest doesn't make sense this

1090
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:30,400
cross our rest doesn't make sense this
 

1091
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,510
cross our rest doesn't make sense this
thing makes sense okay

1092
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
thing makes sense okay
 

1093
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,990
thing makes sense okay
so i'm going to erase

1094
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
so i'm going to erase
 

1095
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,789
so i'm going to erase
embrace this one and erase this one just

1096
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
embrace this one and erase this one just
 

1097
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,149
embrace this one and erase this one just
two here

1098
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
two here
 

1099
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,630
two here
are you kidding me yes of course baby i

1100
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
are you kidding me yes of course baby i
 

1101
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,750
are you kidding me yes of course baby i
know you can do it

1102
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
know you can do it
 

1103
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,270
know you can do it
i can't why is sound okay so j equals

1104
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
i can't why is sound okay so j equals
 

1105
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,029
i can't why is sound okay so j equals
i plus y okay so

1106
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,039
i plus y okay so
 

1107
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,230
i plus y okay so
we want to cross that yeah of course so

1108
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
we want to cross that yeah of course so
 

1109
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,470
we want to cross that yeah of course so
j

1110
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
j
 

1111
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,909
j
smaller than i smaller than n j is four

1112
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919
smaller than i smaller than n j is four
 

1113
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,870
smaller than i smaller than n j is four
for example yeah add equal one we want

1114
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:00,880
for example yeah add equal one we want
 

1115
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,350
for example yeah add equal one we want
to add multiple equals

1116
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
to add multiple equals
 

1117
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,710
to add multiple equals
yeah add equal one two two

1118
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
yeah add equal one two two
 

1119
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,390
yeah add equal one two two
two which one is two i yeah

1120
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
two which one is two i yeah
 

1121
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,950
two which one is two i yeah
okay i know why we are doing this yj

1122
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
okay i know why we are doing this yj
 

1123
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,750
okay i know why we are doing this yj
smaller than

1124
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
smaller than
 

1125
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,630
smaller than
equal n what should we do we want to

1126
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
equal n what should we do we want to
 

1127
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,029
equal n what should we do we want to
mark these prime to false right

1128
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
mark these prime to false right
 

1129
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,270
mark these prime to false right
cross other numbers i think this is

1130
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,280
cross other numbers i think this is
 

1131
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,230
cross other numbers i think this is
false

1132
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,240
false
 

1133
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,510
false
yes how do we cross all the numbers

1134
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
yes how do we cross all the numbers
 

1135
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,630
yes how do we cross all the numbers
how do we cross numbers we this is the

1136
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:28,640
how do we cross numbers we this is the
 

1137
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,350
how do we cross numbers we this is the
array it's

1138
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
array it's
 

1139
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,149
array it's
planned array it's a way which is two

1140
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159
planned array it's a way which is two
 

1141
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,909
planned array it's a way which is two
four two first and we want to

1142
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
four two first and we want to
 

1143
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,669
four two first and we want to
cross out j

1144
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
cross out j
 

1145
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,390
cross out j
in the array to force so which array are

1146
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
in the array to force so which array are
 

1147
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,190
in the array to force so which array are
we using

1148
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,200
we using
 

1149
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,990
we using
which where is the no this is prime

1150
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
which where is the no this is prime
 

1151
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,909
which where is the no this is prime
array come on

1152
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919
array come on
 

1153
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,870
array come on
yeah it's prime what is grand and how do

1154
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880
yeah it's prime what is grand and how do
 

1155
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,310
yeah it's prime what is grand and how do
you reference the j number

1156
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320

 

1157
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,630

yeah j bracket

1158
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640

 

1159
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,830

yeah you see it's easier to read

1160
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:01,840
yeah you see it's easier to read
 

1161
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,190
yeah you see it's easier to read
but but when you actually write it you

1162
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
but but when you actually write it you
 

1163
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,070
but but when you actually write it you
it seems harder right i'm right yeah so

1164
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
it seems harder right i'm right yeah so
 

1165
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,710
it seems harder right i'm right yeah so
practice

1166
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720
practice
 

1167
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,190
practice
makes perfect even you understand if i

1168
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
makes perfect even you understand if i
 

1169
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,630
makes perfect even you understand if i
erase it again you

1170
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:12,640
erase it again you
 

1171
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,710
erase it again you
you think about it yeah it doesn't make
