2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:04,480
go hello hello mr area everybody
 

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,190
go hello hello mr area everybody
yeah okay so today we want to talk about

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
yeah okay so today we want to talk about
 

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,070
yeah okay so today we want to talk about
the numbers

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
the numbers
 

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,749
the numbers
let's say one five 153

8
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:11,759
let's say one five 153
 

9
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,509
let's say one five 153
this is a very special number okay why

10
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
this is a very special number okay why
 

11
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,310
this is a very special number okay why
is this why how many digits these have

12
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,320
is this why how many digits these have
 

13
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,750
is this why how many digits these have
three three digits okay three digits and

14
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760
three three digits okay three digits and
 

15
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,710
three three digits okay three digits and
one to the power of three plus five to

16
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
one to the power of three plus five to
 

17
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,390
one to the power of three plus five to
the power of three

18
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
the power of three
 

19
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,070
the power of three
to the power three plus three to the

20
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
to the power three plus three to the
 

21
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,750
to the power three plus three to the
power three equals

22
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
power three equals
 

23
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,029
power three equals
how many can you give me answer one to

24
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
how many can you give me answer one to
 

25
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,549
how many can you give me answer one to
the power three because this is there

26
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
the power three because this is there
 

27
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:33,830
the power three because this is there
are three digits

28
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
are three digits
 

29
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,470
are three digits
so it's technically one times three yeah

30
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
so it's technically one times three yeah
 

31
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,190
so it's technically one times three yeah
so one

32
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
so one
 

33
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,590
so one
yeah plus five times right and five

34
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600

 

35
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,950

um 125 yeah plus

36
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
um 125 yeah plus
 

37
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,110
um 125 yeah plus
three times three seven okay how many

38
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,120

 

39
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,910

153 okay so what does it mean

40
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920

 

41
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,510

yeah so it's the same we call this am

let's take this one by one okay
 

107
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,949
let's take this one by one okay
so how many digits given the 153

108
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
so how many digits given the 153
 

109
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,770
so how many digits given the 153
how do you know how many digits

110
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:30,780

113
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,869

yeah how do you know it's three digits

114
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
yeah how do you know it's three digits
 

115
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,110
yeah how do you know it's three digits
it's not string if we just string

116
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
it's not string if we just string
 

117
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,110
it's not string if we just string
if we just string we can use the length

118
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
if we just string we can use the length
 

119
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,150
if we just string we can use the length
right yeah

120
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
right yeah
 

121
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,030
right yeah
lens that now giving you three right

122
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
lens that now giving you three right
 

123
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,070
lens that now giving you three right
okay so

124
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
okay so
 

125
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,190
okay so
first uh so what to do if if

first uh so what to do if if
 

127
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,589
first uh so what to do if if
it's a string we know it's three digits

128
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
it's a string we know it's three digits
 

129
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,470
it's a string we know it's three digits
so we can

130
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
so we can
 

131
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,670
so we can
do what in order to get this

132
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
do what in order to get this
 

133
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,910
do what in order to get this
yeah in order to use this function what

plus equals one
three and divided by ten

258
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
three and divided by ten
 

259
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,309
three and divided by ten
1 divided by 10 um 0.1

260
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
1 divided by 10 um 0.1
 

261
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,309
1 divided by 10 um 0.1
okay zero okay because it is integer you

00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
okay zero okay because it is integer you
 

263
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,469
okay zero okay because it is integer you
see y n may be quick okay

264
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
see y n may be quick okay
 

265
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,870
see y n may be quick okay
so what does it mean look one side three

266
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
so what does it mean look one side three
 

267
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,590
so what does it mean look one side three
becomes

268
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
becomes
 

269
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,790
becomes
one phi becomes one becomes zero every

270
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
one phi becomes one becomes zero every
 

271
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,309
one phi becomes one becomes zero every
time i get rid of the one

272
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
time i get rid of the one
 

273
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,029
time i get rid of the one
the digit i can read all the very much

274
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
the digit i can read all the very much
 

275
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:25,749
the digit i can read all the very much
distance

look
 

307
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,870
look
at 10 10 to the power of a

308
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
at 10 10 to the power of a
 

309
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,990
at 10 10 to the power of a
equals n right

310
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
equals n right
 

311
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,390
equals n right
equals n and then

312
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
equals n and then
 

313
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,550
equals n and then
what a equals

314
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
what a equals
 

315
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,629
what a equals
log 10 to the n right

316
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
log 10 to the n right
 

317
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,790
log 10 to the n right
10 to the power of a equals m you can

318
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
10 to the power of a equals m you can
 

319
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,990
10 to the power of a equals m you can
write it this way

320
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
write it this way
 

321
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,150
write it this way
right so we want to know the number of

322
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
right so we want to know the number of
 

323
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,990
right so we want to know the number of
digits a right 0.12

yeah okay so if we if the
 

327
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,990
yeah okay so if we if the
n so we can just do this mathematics

328
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
n so we can just do this mathematics
 

329
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,029
n so we can just do this mathematics
okay

337
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,670
master log you can also do it log 10
yeah also you can do the math dialogue

338
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
yeah also you can do the math dialogue
 

339
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,869
yeah also you can do the math dialogue
and base 10 base 10 this is the same as

340
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
and base 10 base 10 this is the same as
 

341
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,510
and base 10 base 10 this is the same as
log 10 and this is the same okay

342
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
log 10 and this is the same okay
 

343
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,749
log 10 and this is the same okay
okay that may say log 10 look at that

344
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
okay that may say log 10 look at that
 

345
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,029
okay that may say log 10 look at that
here

346

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,710
um divide um
what i give you two one is this the

504
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
what i give you two one is this the
 

505
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,150
what i give you two one is this the
other one is this which one

506
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
other one is this which one
 

507
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,990
other one is this which one
so how do you use this to get 153

508
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,000
so how do you use this to get 153
 

509
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,430
so how do you use this to get 153
to get a three rounds

510
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440

 

511
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,350

yeah okay what's 153 and

512
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
yeah okay what's 153 and
 

513
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:15,610
yeah okay what's 153 and
my mother

514

153 more there is one come on it's not a

518
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
153 more there is one come on it's not a
 

519
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,150
153 more there is one come on it's not a
hard question right

520
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
hard question right
 

521
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,470
hard question right
yeah okay that will be confident this is

522
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
yeah okay that will be confident this is
 

523
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,829
yeah okay that will be confident this is
this is the easy question

524
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839

 

525
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,590

okay that's one way what's the time

526
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
okay that's one way what's the time
 

527
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:46,310
okay that's one way what's the time
complexity

528
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320

 

529
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,790

is log 10 n right because that's the

530
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
is log 10 n right because that's the
 

531
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,310
is log 10 n right because that's the
number of digits

532
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
number of digits
 

533
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,230
number of digits
that's the number of digits right

534
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
that's the number of digits right
 

535
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,350
that's the number of digits right
correct yeah

536
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
correct yeah
 

537
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,629
correct yeah
okay so the other way the other way is

538
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
okay so the other way the other way is
 

539
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,230
okay so the other way the other way is
we can convert it to a string

540
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
we can convert it to a string
 

541
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,150
we can convert it to a string
right we can convert it to a string

542
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
right we can convert it to a string
 

543
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,350
right we can convert it to a string
s equal s t r n right here

544
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
s equal s t r n right here
 

545
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,949
s equal s t r n right here
okay then answer equals zero and i can

546
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
okay then answer equals zero and i can
 

547
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,910
okay then answer equals zero and i can
just fall

548
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
just fall
 

549
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,350
just fall
i in s

550
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
i in s
 

551
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,870
i in s
answer plus equals

552
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
answer plus equals
 

553
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,550
answer plus equals
