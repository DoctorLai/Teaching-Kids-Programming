hello hello hello
look this is yesterday so we talked

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
look this is yesterday so we talked
 

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,510
look this is yesterday so we talked
about how to check binary tree is

6
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
about how to check binary tree is
 

7
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,390
about how to check binary tree is
symmetric right

8
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
symmetric right
 

9
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,190
symmetric right
remember this yeah yeah so this is

10
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
remember this yeah yeah so this is
 

11
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,629
remember this yeah yeah so this is
requested

12
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:12,639
requested
 

13
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,150
requested
yeah we check if a a and b the variable

14
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
yeah we check if a a and b the variable
 

15
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,349
yeah we check if a a and b the variable
and then it's sub

16
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
and then it's sub
 

17
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,670
and then it's sub
it's subtree is also symmetric okay so

18
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
it's subtree is also symmetric okay so
 

19
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,870
it's subtree is also symmetric okay so
today

20
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
today
 

21
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,269
today
we talk about a few things and then we

22
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
we talk about a few things and then we
 

23
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,950
we talk about a few things and then we
talk we'll come back to these

24
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
talk we'll come back to these
 

25
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,269
talk we'll come back to these
again okay so it'll be very interesting

26
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:27,279
again okay so it'll be very interesting
 

27
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,070
again okay so it'll be very interesting
because it'll be

28
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
because it'll be
 

29
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,350
because it'll be
very interesting okay so

30
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
very interesting okay so
 

31
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,950

first of all how do you make a copy of a

32
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
first of all how do you make a copy of a
 

33
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,709
first of all how do you make a copy of a
tree

34
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
tree
 

35
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,869
tree
you know first of all if i give you a

36
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
you know first of all if i give you a
 

37
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,990
you know first of all if i give you a
tree yeah give me your

38
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
tree yeah give me your
 

39
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,270
tree yeah give me your
if you copy it the same way yeah

40
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
if you copy it the same way yeah
 

41
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,190
if you copy it the same way yeah
okay so at least i i want you to copy

42
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
okay so at least i i want you to copy
 

43
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,630
okay so at least i i want you to copy
you know copy so make another copy so

44
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
you know copy so make another copy so
 

45
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,790
you know copy so make another copy so
this function will be like clone okay

46
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
this function will be like clone okay
 

47
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,430
this function will be like clone okay
you know what's clone

48
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:57,440
you know what's clone
 

49
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,549
you know what's clone
clone chrome is the copy yeah

50
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
clone chrome is the copy yeah
 

51
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,110
clone chrome is the copy yeah
to make a clone make a clone yeah make a

52
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
to make a clone make a clone yeah make a
 

53
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,229
to make a clone make a clone yeah make a
copy

54
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
copy
 

55
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,429
copy
yeah so what do you do look

56
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
yeah so what do you do look
 

57
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,950
yeah so what do you do look
this we the copy in computer we have two

58
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
this we the copy in computer we have two
 

59
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,550
this we the copy in computer we have two
kinds of copy one is

60
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
kinds of copy one is
 

61
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,270
kinds of copy one is
called deep copy the other one is called

62
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
called deep copy the other one is called
 

63
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,469
called deep copy the other one is called
what's the opposite of dip

64
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
what's the opposite of dip
 

65
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,870
what's the opposite of dip
yeah we're done deep copy and shallow

66
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
yeah we're done deep copy and shallow
 

67
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,870
yeah we're done deep copy and shallow
copy deep copy

68
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
copy deep copy
 

69
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,109
copy deep copy
did you get that correct share a little

70
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
did you get that correct share a little
 

71
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,350
did you get that correct share a little
copy

72
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
copy
 

73
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,950
copy
so can you tell me what's the difference

74
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
so can you tell me what's the difference
 

75
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,670
so can you tell me what's the difference
deep copy and share copy

76
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
deep copy and share copy
 

77
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,749
deep copy and share copy
they're the opposite yeah they're

78
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
they're the opposite yeah they're
 

79
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,109
they're the opposite yeah they're
opposite so

80
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
opposite so
 

81
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,429
opposite so
what's yellow copy what's deep copy

82
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439

 

83
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,590

can you make a guess deep and shallow

84
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
can you make a guess deep and shallow
 

85
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,190
can you make a guess deep and shallow
yeah so okay you can think of it as a

86
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
yeah so okay you can think of it as a
 

87
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,830
yeah so okay you can think of it as a
complete

88
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
complete
 

89
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,350
complete
you know i want to make a complete copy

90
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
you know i want to make a complete copy
 

91
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,350
you know i want to make a complete copy
so once i copy it

92
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
so once i copy it
 

93
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,910
so once i copy it
copy and paste it copy it you'll be the

94
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
copy and paste it copy it you'll be the
 

95
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,710
copy and paste it copy it you'll be the
same

96
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
same
 

97
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,069
same
you'll be exactly a copy right so

98
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
you'll be exactly a copy right so
 

99
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,590
you'll be exactly a copy right so
you i make another copy yeah

100
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
you i make another copy yeah
 

101
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,630
you i make another copy yeah
so these in memory you'll be different

102
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
so these in memory you'll be different
 

103
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,429
so these in memory you'll be different
places

104
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
places
 

105
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,590
places
so what i mean different places is you

106
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
so what i mean different places is you
 

107
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,710
so what i mean different places is you
can change

108
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
can change
 

109
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,190
can change
the things here but it wouldn't affect

110
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
the things here but it wouldn't affect
 

111
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,110
the things here but it wouldn't affect
here because they're different

112
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
here because they're different
 

113
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,390
here because they're different
yeah yeah they look the same they look

114
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
yeah yeah they look the same they look
 

115
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,070
yeah yeah they look the same they look
as simple they're different places you

116
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
as simple they're different places you
 

117
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,470
as simple they're different places you
change

118
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
change
 

119
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,110
change
this place you change the value to seven

120
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
this place you change the value to seven
 

121
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,910
this place you change the value to seven
and these ones

122
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
and these ones
 

123
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,790
and these ones
get one effect won't be authentic

124
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
get one effect won't be authentic
 

125
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,470
get one effect won't be authentic
shallow copy is the other set

126
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
shallow copy is the other set
 

127
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,510
shallow copy is the other set
and on other cases it's like alias

128
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
and on other cases it's like alias
 

129
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,470
and on other cases it's like alias
do you get it it's like alias so you

130
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
do you get it it's like alias so you
 

131
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,670
do you get it it's like alias so you
make a copy

132
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
make a copy
 

133
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,509
make a copy
of these then you'll be just a

134
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
of these then you'll be just a
 

135
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,470
of these then you'll be just a
another pointer points to that okay so

136
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
another pointer points to that okay so
 

137
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,949
another pointer points to that okay so
you'll be

138
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
you'll be
 

139
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,110
you'll be
point is it's not an individual it's not

140
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
point is it's not an individual it's not
 

141
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,949
point is it's not an individual it's not
an independent copy

142
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
an independent copy
 

143
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,910
an independent copy
right so when you change the value like

144
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
right so when you change the value like
 

145
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,990
right so when you change the value like
if you change the value here then you'll

146
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
if you change the value here then you'll
 

147
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,309
if you change the value here then you'll
be

148
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
be
 

149
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,990
be
linked to here your chain also be

150
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
linked to here your chain also be
 

151
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,750
linked to here your chain also be
changed it's the other way right

152
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
changed it's the other way right
 

153
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,270
changed it's the other way right
it's like in areas for example like

154
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
it's like in areas for example like
 

155
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,589
it's like in areas for example like
i give you another name like what's your

156
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
i give you another name like what's your
 

157
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,190
i give you another name like what's your
favorite name

158
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
favorite name

and you you'll respond that's called
 

165
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,390
and you you'll respond that's called
shield copy

166
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
shield copy
 

167
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,589
shield copy
it's like ryan is a clone of you

168
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
it's like ryan is a clone of you
 

169
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,790
it's like ryan is a clone of you
right i call ryan right

170
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
right i call ryan right
 

171
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,270
right i call ryan right
and then you wouldn't respond because

172
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
and then you wouldn't respond because
 

173
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,550
and then you wouldn't respond because
it's different right

174
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
it's different right
 

175
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,949
it's different right
do you get this point okay so we are now

176
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
do you get this point okay so we are now
 

177
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,990
do you get this point okay so we are now
talking about

178
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
talking about
 

179
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,430
talking about
the difficulties with deep copy

180
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
the difficulties with deep copy
 

181
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,710
the difficulties with deep copy
in in computer look

182
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
in in computer look
 

183
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,910
in in computer look
if a shallow copy so what's your copy

184
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
if a shallow copy so what's your copy
 

185
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,589
if a shallow copy so what's your copy
wrong

186
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599

 

187
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,869

shallow copy in in python you can just

188
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
shallow copy in in python you can just
 

189
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,710
shallow copy in in python you can just
do this i create a node

190
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
do this i create a node
 

191
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,070
do this i create a node
right root a new node like the same

192
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
right root a new node like the same
 

193
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,550
right root a new node like the same
neural new no no

194
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
neural new no no
 

195
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,750
neural new no no
then you can say let's uh let's call it

196
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
then you can say let's uh let's call it
 

197
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,869
then you can say let's uh let's call it
tree okay three this is three and then

198
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
tree okay three this is three and then
 

199
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,149
tree okay three this is three and then
island return return new law

200
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
island return return new law
 

201
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,750
island return return new law
okay so you just copy this no

202
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
okay so you just copy this no
 

203
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,149
okay so you just copy this no
but you are not copying its subtrees

204
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
but you are not copying its subtrees
 

205
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,550
but you are not copying its subtrees
right you are not copying these subtrees

206
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
right you are not copying these subtrees
 

207
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,030
right you are not copying these subtrees
so this subtree is the same is exactly

208
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
so this subtree is the same is exactly
 

209
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,309
so this subtree is the same is exactly
the same as the previous

210
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
the same as the previous
 

211
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,390
the same as the previous
right it's just good you don't know but

212
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
right it's just good you don't know but
 

213
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,509
right it's just good you don't know but
for the column

214
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
for the column
 

215
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,710
for the column
let's talk about clone the entire thing

216
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
let's talk about clone the entire thing
 

217
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,789
let's talk about clone the entire thing
and then you tell me what to do okay

218
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
and then you tell me what to do okay
 

219
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,390
and then you tell me what to do okay
it's like look

220
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
it's like look
 

221
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,390
it's like look

do you get it we're creating a new node

264
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
do you get it we're creating a new node
 

265
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,590
do you get it we're creating a new node
with the value exactly variable but we

266
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
with the value exactly variable but we
 

267
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,150
with the value exactly variable but we
are because

retaining the new node yeah this is
 

275
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,629
retaining the new node yeah this is
called deep copy

276
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
called deep copy
 

277
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,590
called deep copy
look at

278
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600

 

279
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,629

so now we talk about another one which

280
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
so now we talk about another one which
 

281
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,510
so now we talk about another one which
is called uh

282
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
is called uh
 

283
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,950
is called uh
checked with two trees are the same

284
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
checked with two trees are the same
 

285
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,510
checked with two trees are the same
yeah we have one two three two three how

yeah we have one two three two three how
 

287
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,950
yeah we have one two three two three how
do we check it's the same

288
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
do we check it's the same
 

289
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,189
do we check it's the same
one it's the same i mean the structure

290
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
one it's the same i mean the structure
 

291
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,309
one it's the same i mean the structure
is the same

292
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
is the same
 

293
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,830
is the same
and the values are also the same okay

294
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
and the values are also the same okay
 

295
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,909
and the values are also the same okay
so yeah tell me how to do it all right

296
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
so yeah tell me how to do it all right
 

297
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,510
so yeah tell me how to do it all right
define let's call it same okay

298
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
define let's call it same okay
 

299
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,550
define let's call it same okay
same or maybe maybe equal

300
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560

equal same it's not quite a good word

302
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
equal same it's not quite a good word
 

303
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,189
equal same it's not quite a good word
equal right because they are not the

304
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
equal right because they are not the
 

305
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,270
equal right because they are not the
same but they can be equal right

306
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
same but they can be equal right
 

307
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,510
same but they can be equal right
yes let's call it equal equal

308
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
yes let's call it equal equal
 

309
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,749
yes let's call it equal equal

if both trees are empty we should call

328
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
if both trees are empty we should call
 

329
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,589
if both trees are empty we should call
it

00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:07,599
it
 

331
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,029

00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
yeah then if
 

333
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,230
yeah then if
a is noun in this case

334
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
a is noun in this case
 

335
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,230
a is noun in this case

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,510

it must be not be equal

check the 10 nodes at most then you'll

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,590
watch through you're not making return
what

504
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
what
 

505
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,430
what
left right wait

506
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
left right wait
 

507
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,509
left right wait
you're making it you're not no why are

508
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
you're making it you're not no why are
 

509
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,870
you're making it you're not no why are
we doing here we are writing new words

510
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
we doing here we are writing new words
 

511
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,750
we doing here we are writing new words
we are reading the root i thought we

512
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
we are reading the root i thought we
 

513
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,590
we are reading the root i thought we
yeah i know look we are creating the

514
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
yeah i know look we are creating the
 

515
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,430
yeah i know look we are creating the
we are loot and we need to assign that's

516
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
we are loot and we need to assign that's
 

517
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,750
we are loot and we need to assign that's
why why you say between two or four come

518
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
why why you say between two or four come
 

519
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,150
why why you say between two or four come
on

520
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
on
 

521
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,550
on
don't make a guess okay now we are

522
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:26,560
don't make a guess okay now we are
 

523
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,470
don't make a guess okay now we are
inverting so now how can we check if

524
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
inverting so now how can we check if
 

525
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,550
inverting so now how can we check if
two trees are a tree is symmetric

526
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
two trees are a tree is symmetric
 

527
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,150
two trees are a tree is symmetric
remember how do we check the symmetry

528
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
remember how do we check the symmetry
 

529
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,750
remember how do we check the symmetry
tree

530
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
tree
 

531
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,710
tree
okay you tell me okay you tell me okay

532
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
okay you tell me okay you tell me okay
 

533
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,670
okay you tell me okay you tell me okay
symmetric

534
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
symmetric
 

535
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,150
symmetric
loot okay i can i can do this yeah look

536
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
loot okay i can i can do this yeah look
 

537
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,430
loot okay i can i can do this yeah look
clown uh let's call it new

538
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
clown uh let's call it new
 

539
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,829
clown uh let's call it new
uh copy okay copy equal as

540
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
uh copy okay copy equal as
 

541
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,990
uh copy okay copy equal as
clone let's clone this tree first

542
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
clone let's clone this tree first
 

543
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,509
clone let's clone this tree first
okay yeah yeah yes and then what should

544
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
okay yeah yeah yes and then what should
 

545
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,269
okay yeah yeah yes and then what should
we do with it

546
00:12:59,269 --> 00:12:59,279
we do with it
 

547
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,389
we do with it
then we also need to invert it

548
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
then we also need to invert it
 

549
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,069
then we also need to invert it
yeah invert the tree okay

550
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
yeah invert the tree okay
 

551
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,790
yeah invert the tree okay
yeah and then

552
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
yeah and then
 

553
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,910
yeah and then
how do we check if the two three sides

554
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
how do we check if the two three sides
 

555
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,829
how do we check if the two three sides
if the tree is magic all you need to do

556
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839

 

557
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:32,310

is

558
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320

 

559
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,750

the other one is

560
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
the other one is
 

561
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,910
the other one is
uh you make a guess come on equal root

562
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
uh you make a guess come on equal root
 

563
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,230
uh you make a guess come on equal root
n1 we are comparing the load with

564
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
n1 we are comparing the load with
 

565
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,829
n1 we are comparing the load with
white claim clock yes copy

566
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839
white claim clock yes copy
 

567
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,670
white claim clock yes copy
copy do you get it look

568
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
copy do you get it look
 

569
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,670
copy do you get it look
we copy the tree right we copy the tree

570
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
we copy the tree right we copy the tree
 

571
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,750
we copy the tree right we copy the tree
we invert it and if the inward version

572
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
we invert it and if the inward version
 

573
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,790
we invert it and if the inward version
is the same as the root

574
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
is the same as the root
 

575
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,590
is the same as the root
then it's symmetric am i right yes i'm

576
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:03,600
then it's symmetric am i right yes i'm
 

577
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,310
then it's symmetric am i right yes i'm
right

578
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
right
 

579
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,430
right
look one right

580
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440
look one right
 

581
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,629
look one right
two two

582
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
two two
 

583
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,150
two two
three three four

584
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
three three four
 

585
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,230
three three four
look four we make a copy

586
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
look four we make a copy
 

587
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,670
look four we make a copy
and then we use this what's in that

588
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
and then we use this what's in that
 

589
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,509
and then we use this what's in that
your inverse version will be one

590
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
your inverse version will be one
 

591
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,670
your inverse version will be one
two two and one

592
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
two two and one
 

593
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,430
two two and one
it will be the same as this one yeah

594
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
it will be the same as this one yeah
 

595
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,030
it will be the same as this one yeah
yeah exactly

596
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
yeah exactly
 

597
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,870
yeah exactly
so because that and you check if these

598
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
so because that and you check if these
 

599
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,230
so because that and you check if these
two are the same even

600
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
two are the same even
 

601
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,470
two are the same even
is equal it's it's symmetric got it

602
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
is equal it's it's symmetric got it
 

603
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,990
is equal it's it's symmetric got it
do we have to clone it no we actually

604
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
do we have to clone it no we actually
 

605
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,670
do we have to clone it no we actually
don't need to clone it why can't i have

606
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
don't need to clone it why can't i have
 

607
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,590
don't need to clone it why can't i have
a razor please okay

608
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
a razor please okay
 

609
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,550
a razor please okay
look if we allow to modify it we can

610
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
look if we allow to modify it we can
 

611
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,829
look if we allow to modify it we can
just do this okay you tell me okay

612
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839

 

613
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,110

return

614
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
return
 

615
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,069
return
that's the same equa

616
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079

 

617
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,430

left plus

618
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
left plus
 

619
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,470
left plus
and something here

620
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
and something here
 

621
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:22,710
and something here
really

622
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720

 

623
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,629

what does it mean look even three

624
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
what does it mean look even three
 

625
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,829
what does it mean look even three
and that means okay let's see

626
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
and that means okay let's see
 

627
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,350
and that means okay let's see
let's do this look

628
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
let's do this look
 

629
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,670
let's do this look
look this blue we want to check if it's

630
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
look this blue we want to check if it's
 

631
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,710
look this blue we want to check if it's
symmetric

632
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
symmetric
 

633
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,749
symmetric
we can compare its left tree right

634
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
we can compare its left tree right
 

635
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,470
we can compare its left tree right
and then right three we need to invert

636
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
and then right three we need to invert
 

637
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,910
and then right three we need to invert
the right tree

638
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
the right tree
 

639
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,509
the right tree
even writer will be this yeah then if

640
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
even writer will be this yeah then if
 

641
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,470
even writer will be this yeah then if
they are equal

642
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
they are equal
 

643
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,509
they are equal
then it's symmetric do you get it yeah

644
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
then it's symmetric do you get it yeah
 

645
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,829
then it's symmetric do you get it yeah
yeah yeah if you're comparing the loot

646
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
yeah yeah if you're comparing the loot
 

647
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,870
yeah yeah if you're comparing the loot
all right then

648
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
all right then
 

649
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,990
all right then
then it must not be equal right

650
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
then it must not be equal right
 

651
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,310
then it must not be equal right
right because this you'll be you'll be

652
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
right because this you'll be you'll be
 

653
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,150
right because this you'll be you'll be
like that and this is not symmetric at

654
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
like that and this is not symmetric at
 

655
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,389
like that and this is not symmetric at
all

656
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
all
 

657
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,509
all
right okay what's the complexity

658
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
right okay what's the complexity
 

659
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,550
right okay what's the complexity
i went yeah for most the final

660
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
i went yeah for most the final
 

661
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,310
i went yeah for most the final
things yes it's awesome because you need

662
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
things yes it's awesome because you need
 

663
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,990
things yes it's awesome because you need
to visit the trees

664
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
to visit the trees
 

665
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,550
to visit the trees
end times nine years number of times so

666
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:14,560
end times nine years number of times so
 

667
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,749
end times nine years number of times so
do you get it

668
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
do you get it
 

669
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,550
do you get it
so what do we learn today can you review

670
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
so what do we learn today can you review
 

671
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,590
so what do we learn today can you review
everything yeah

672
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
everything yeah
 

673
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,790
everything yeah
what kind of function do we learn today

674
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
what kind of function do we learn today
 

675
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,870
what kind of function do we learn today
we have we know that deep chrome and uh

676
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
we have we know that deep chrome and uh
 

677
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,550
we have we know that deep chrome and uh
yellow color can you tell me what's deep

678
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
yellow color can you tell me what's deep
 

679
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,550
yellow color can you tell me what's deep
color what's yellow color

680
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
color what's yellow color
 

681
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,629
color what's yellow color
what is sheer copy deep copy is yellow

682
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
what is sheer copy deep copy is yellow
 

683
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,990
what is sheer copy deep copy is yellow
copy

684
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,000
copy
 

685
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,269
copy
just in one word

686
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279

 

687
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,269

come on copy what's the deep copy

688
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
come on copy what's the deep copy
 

689
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,110
come on copy what's the deep copy
and what's what's the difference between

690
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
and what's what's the difference between
 

691
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,150
and what's what's the difference between
deep copy and shallow copy

692
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
deep copy and shallow copy
 

693
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,190
deep copy and shallow copy
it

694
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:48,200

 

695
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,430

[Applause]

696
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440

 

697
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,509

so if a tree if a tree

698
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
so if a tree if a tree
 

699
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,590
so if a tree if a tree
i want to make a copy exactly

700
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
i want to make a copy exactly
 

701
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,110
i want to make a copy exactly
then you'll be another tree totally

702
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
then you'll be another tree totally
 

703
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,750
then you'll be another tree totally
independent yeah if you make a just

704
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
independent yeah if you make a just
 

705
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,870
independent yeah if you make a just
assign a note

706
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
assign a note
 

707
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,390
assign a note
to it a copy of the note

708
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
to it a copy of the note
 

709
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,189
to it a copy of the note
yeah and then you visit this copy to the

710
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
yeah and then you visit this copy to the
 

711
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,110
yeah and then you visit this copy to the
left you'll be pointing to this

712
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
left you'll be pointing to this
 

713
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,029
left you'll be pointing to this
you get it this is called yellow copy

714
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
you get it this is called yellow copy
 

715
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,549
you get it this is called yellow copy
yeah

716
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
yeah
 

717
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,789
yeah
apart from the chrome method what do we

718
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
apart from the chrome method what do we
 

719
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,470
apart from the chrome method what do we
have what we learned

720
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
have what we learned
 

721
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,309
have what we learned
also we check if

722
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
also we check if
 

723
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,990
also we check if
two trees are symmetric

724
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
two trees are symmetric
 

725
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,950
two trees are symmetric
uh yes matrix and also equal right this

726
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
uh yes matrix and also equal right this
 

727
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,750
uh yes matrix and also equal right this
is equal right

728
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
is equal right
 

729
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,190
is equal right
yes and then we also know we invert we

730
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
yes and then we also know we invert we
 

731
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,590
yes and then we also know we invert we
know how to invert the binary tree yeah

732
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
know how to invert the binary tree yeah
 

733
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,310
know how to invert the binary tree yeah
yeah based on these three we also can

734
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
yeah based on these three we also can
 

735
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,190
yeah based on these three we also can
know how to do this symmetric yeah

736
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
know how to do this symmetric yeah
 

737
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,510
know how to do this symmetric yeah
symmetric do you get it so these are the

738
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
symmetric do you get it so these are the
 

739
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,270
symmetric do you get it so these are the
four

740
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
four
 

741
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,590
four
four things we have visited today yeah

742
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
four things we have visited today yeah
 

743
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,430
four things we have visited today yeah
we are visiting today today

744
