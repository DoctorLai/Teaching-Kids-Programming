00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
remember what
 

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,830
remember what
we talked about yesterday

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840

 

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,590

today we're going to find another

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
today we're going to find another
 

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,150
today we're going to find another
interesting program which is

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,160
interesting program which is
 

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,230
interesting program which is
interesting to check if the link is has

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
interesting to check if the link is has
 

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,420
interesting to check if the link is has
cycles cycle going

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,430
cycles cycle going
 

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:37,460
cycles cycle going

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,830

does it have cycle yes okay good so

18
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
does it have cycle yes okay good so
 

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,110
does it have cycle yes okay good so
today we're going to

20
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
today we're going to
 

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,310
today we're going to
again given this hat and then find an

22
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
again given this hat and then find an
 

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,590
again given this hat and then find an
ethereum to see if elise has a cycle so

24
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
ethereum to see if elise has a cycle so
 

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,510
ethereum to see if elise has a cycle so
any idea how we do it

26
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
any idea how we do it
 

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,110
any idea how we do it
uh i think because that

28
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
uh i think because that
 

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,869
uh i think because that
that then tv and and then

30
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
that then tv and and then
 

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,189
that then tv and and then
you can you're gonna do nice and your

32
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
you can you're gonna do nice and your
 

33
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,670
you can you're gonna do nice and your
department will say how to cycle right

34
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:07,680
department will say how to cycle right
 

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,030
department will say how to cycle right
so how do you do that how to do that

36
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
so how do you do that how to do that
 

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,469
so how do you do that how to do that
specifically you do one

38
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479
specifically you do one
 

39
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,789
specifically you do one
two three four five and that one again

40
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
two three four five and that one again
 

41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,469
two three four five and that one again
so that means it's

42
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
so that means it's
 

43
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,510
so that means it's
a cycle because we already bought

44
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
a cycle because we already bought
 

45
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,749
a cycle because we already bought
yeah okay you mentioned something which

46
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
yeah okay you mentioned something which
 

47
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,230
yeah okay you mentioned something which
is interesting but

48
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
is interesting but
 

49
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,910
is interesting but
we need to remember which notes we have

50
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
we need to remember which notes we have
 

51
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,710
we need to remember which notes we have
represented

52
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720

 

53
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,789

can you please say okay no running

54
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
can you please say okay no running
 

55
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,310
can you please say okay no running
please it's

56
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,320
please it's
 

57
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,950
please it's
youtube come on so look remember what we

58
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
youtube come on so look remember what we
 

59
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,550
youtube come on so look remember what we
have talked about the hash table the

60
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
have talked about the hash table the
 

61
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,590
have talked about the hash table the
notebook

62
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
notebook
 

63
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,710
notebook
before yeah so when we visit the note

64
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
before yeah so when we visit the note
 

65
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,910
before yeah so when we visit the note
we put it down our notebook and

66
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
we put it down our notebook and
 

67
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,109
we put it down our notebook and
before we visit the note we check if

68
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
before we visit the note we check if
 

69
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,469
before we visit the note we check if
this note has

70
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
this note has
 

71
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,109
this note has
been written on the notebook yeah if it

72
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
been written on the notebook yeah if it
 

73
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,109
been written on the notebook yeah if it
is then it's a cycle it has a cycle

74
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
is then it's a cycle it has a cycle
 

75
00:01:59,119 --> 00:01:59,830
is then it's a cycle it has a cycle
right because

76
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
right because
 

77
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,910
right because
we have been visited the first time it's

78
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
we have been visited the first time it's
 

79
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,429
we have been visited the first time it's
okay look we're here

80
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
okay look we're here
 

81
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,590
okay look we're here
we put it in the notebook we travel

82
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
we put it in the notebook we travel
 

83
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,070
we put it in the notebook we travel
travel i know you can oh no visit this

84
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
travel i know you can oh no visit this
 

85
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,749
travel i know you can oh no visit this
we found this now already appearing on

86
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
we found this now already appearing on
 

87
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,190
we found this now already appearing on
the notebook

88
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
the notebook
 

89
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,710
the notebook
yeah then then

90
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
yeah then then
 

91
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,350
yeah then then
it has a cycle this is one approach so

92
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
it has a cycle this is one approach so
 

93
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,910
it has a cycle this is one approach so
what's the terminal density

94
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
what's the terminal density
 

95
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,470
what's the terminal density
yeah what's the space complexity yeah

96
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
yeah what's the space complexity yeah
 

97
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,390
yeah what's the space complexity yeah
well because we're using the

98
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
well because we're using the
 

99
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,309
well because we're using the
uh we usually have notebook right

100
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
uh we usually have notebook right
 

101
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,070
uh we usually have notebook right
notebook the most

102
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
notebook the most
 

103
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,509
notebook the most
you put uh at most you put the n uh

104
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519
you put uh at most you put the n uh
 

105
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,949
you put uh at most you put the n uh
notes on it are you okay yeah okay okay

106
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
notes on it are you okay yeah okay okay
 

107
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,750
notes on it are you okay yeah okay okay
are there any solutions remember we

108
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
are there any solutions remember we
 

109
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,830
are there any solutions remember we
talked about the fast and slow

110
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
talked about the fast and slow
 

111
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,820
talked about the fast and slow
yeah remember does it have in this case

112
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:43,830
yeah remember does it have in this case
 

113
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,229
yeah remember does it have in this case

115
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,990
[Music]
can you think of where using the faster

116
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
can you think of where using the faster
 

117
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,110
can you think of where using the faster
so without a notebook

118
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120

so look three three

122
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
so look three three
 

123
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,110
so look three three
wait look this first is the

124
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
wait look this first is the
 

125
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,990
wait look this first is the
red one slow is the black one okay

126
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000

 

127
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,430

so first two step one two i'm here

128
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
so first two step one two i'm here
 

129
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,550
so first two step one two i'm here
slow here okay two step one two

130
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
slow here okay two step one two
 

131
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,149
slow here okay two step one two
slow here two step one two

132
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
slow here two step one two
 

133
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,270
slow here two step one two
slow here you see

134
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
slow here you see
 

135
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,550
slow here you see
so if they meet if they meet there's a

136
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
so if they meet if they meet there's a
 

137
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,270
so if they meet if they meet there's a
cycle

138
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
cycle
 

139
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,990
cycle
right if they don't meet they suppose it

140
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
right if they don't meet they suppose it
 

141
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,869
right if they don't meet they suppose it
can't be a second

142
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
can't be a second
 

143
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,190
can't be a second
am right yeah because fast is always

144
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
am right yeah because fast is always
 

145
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,309
am right yeah because fast is always
cool forward

146
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
cool forward
 

147
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,710
cool forward
yeah they go forward and then if they

148
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
yeah they go forward and then if they
 

149
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,509
yeah they go forward and then if they
meet you know

150
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
meet you know
 

151
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,390
meet you know
the meat collide in here it means that

152
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
the meat collide in here it means that
 

153
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,830
the meat collide in here it means that
there is a cycle otherwise the

154
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
there is a cycle otherwise the
 

155
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,750
there is a cycle otherwise the
left is always faster than entertainment

156
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
left is always faster than entertainment
 

157
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,990
left is always faster than entertainment
right yeah got it

158
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
right yeah got it
 

159
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,949
right yeah got it
okay so now we can yeah what's the time

160
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
okay so now we can yeah what's the time
 

161
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,110
okay so now we can yeah what's the time
capacity of this one

162
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
capacity of this one
 

163
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,470
capacity of this one
what's the space complexity no

164
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
what's the space complexity no
 

165
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,550
what's the space complexity no
a one because we're only using the fast

166
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
a one because we're only using the fast
 

167
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,830
a one because we're only using the fast
and slow

168
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
and slow
 

169
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,830
and slow
these two points at least are constant

170
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
these two points at least are constant
 

171
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,070
these two points at least are constant
because no matter how big

172
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
because no matter how big
 

173
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,190
because no matter how big
the the the link is right these

174
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
the the the link is right these
 

175
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,470
the the the link is right these
i only use two right slowing down yeah

176
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
i only use two right slowing down yeah
 

177
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,869
i only use two right slowing down yeah
okay do you understand yeah the space is

178
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
okay do you understand yeah the space is
 

179
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,789
okay do you understand yeah the space is
all one because we we're only using two

180
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
all one because we we're only using two
 

181
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,629
all one because we we're only using two
points and no matter how big the

182
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
points and no matter how big the
 

183
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,110
points and no matter how big the
link is it doesn't change but the

184
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
link is it doesn't change but the
 

185
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,469
link is it doesn't change but the
notebook is different

186
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
notebook is different
 

187
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,350
notebook is different
if we're using a minion uh if the linked

188
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
if we're using a minion uh if the linked
 

189
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,510
if we're using a minion uh if the linked
list has the minion items and then the

190
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
list has the minion items and then the
 

191
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,070
list has the minion items and then the
more book

192
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
more book
 

193
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,430
more book
the notebook has to be and at least

194
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
the notebook has to be and at least
 

195
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,350
the notebook has to be and at least
store a million items right because

196
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
store a million items right because
 

197
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,110
store a million items right because
you're putting the item on their own

198
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
you're putting the item on their own
 

199
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,030
you're putting the item on their own
notebook right yes yes okay

200
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
notebook right yes yes okay
 

201
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,150
notebook right yes yes okay
so now let's do one

202
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
so now let's do one
 

203
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,550
so now let's do one
one the first first implementation yeah

204
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
one the first first implementation yeah
 

205
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,189
one the first first implementation yeah
defined

206
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
defined
 

207
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,469
defined
has cycle

208
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479

 

209
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,749

head what's missing no

210
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
head what's missing no
 

211
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,670
head what's missing no
problem so now we have a visit remember

212
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
problem so now we have a visit remember
 

213
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,510
problem so now we have a visit remember
we talked about the set before yeah the

214
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
we talked about the set before yeah the
 

215
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,270
we talked about the set before yeah the
notebook yeah set

216
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
notebook yeah set
 

217
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,670
notebook yeah set
read it set yeah why

218
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680

 

219
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,870

hat is not long

220
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
hat is not long
 

221
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,990
hat is not long
why is we are not reaching the end right

222
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
why is we are not reaching the end right
 

223
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,029
why is we are not reaching the end right
yeah now we have to check if if

224
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
yeah now we have to check if if
 

225
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,350
yeah now we have to check if if
head in this we have visited this right

226
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
head in this we have visited this right
 

227
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,710
head in this we have visited this right
yes

228
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
yes
 

229
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,990
yes
return left two

230
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
return left two
 

231
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,270
return left two
right yeah head equals

232
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
right yeah head equals
 

233
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,029
right yeah head equals
head dot next next return false

234
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
head dot next next return false
 

235
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,350
head dot next next return false
and then here we turn fast right yeah

236
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360

 

237
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,749

so that's what that's one approach okay

238
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
so that's what that's one approach okay
 

239
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,270
so that's what that's one approach okay
then i'll hover let's do it

240
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
then i'll hover let's do it
 

241
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,230
then i'll hover let's do it
this second one okay and i mean let me

242
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
this second one okay and i mean let me
 

243
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,950
this second one okay and i mean let me
do it yeah

244
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
do it yeah
 

245
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,150
do it yeah
let's take someone uh

246
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
let's take someone uh
 

247
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,629
let's take someone uh
the second approach we don't need this

248
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
the second approach we don't need this
 

249
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,510
the second approach we don't need this
we don't need this

250
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
we don't need this
 

251
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,830
we don't need this
yeah we have a fast

252
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
yeah we have a fast
 

253
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,070
yeah we have a fast
slow or equals head

254
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
slow or equals head
 

255
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,270
slow or equals head
head and what why

256
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
head and what why
 

257
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,469
head and what why
fast

258
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479

 

259
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,070

fast fast is one fast

260
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
fast fast is one fast
 

261
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,350
fast fast is one fast
is not noun and okay i don't have space

262
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
is not noun and okay i don't have space
 

263
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,950
is not noun and okay i don't have space
but you know fast is not long

264
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
but you know fast is not long
 

265
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,189
but you know fast is not long
and fast don't next is not known

266
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
and fast don't next is not known
 

267
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,230
and fast don't next is not known
right then fast equals fast dot

268
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
right then fast equals fast dot
 

269
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,430
right then fast equals fast dot
next dot next right because we'll travel

270
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
next dot next right because we'll travel
 

271
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,230
next dot next right because we'll travel
two step at a time and that's now

272
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
two step at a time and that's now
 

273
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,270
two step at a time and that's now
because what slide dot net

274
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
because what slide dot net
 

275
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,830
because what slide dot net
yeah and then we need to check we are

276
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:32,840
yeah and then we need to check we are
 

277
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,640
yeah and then we need to check we are
fast

278
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,650
fast
 

279
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:47,189

we check
that has cycle can can i

408
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
that has cycle can can i
 

409
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,550
that has cycle can can i
cut no seeing it right please

410
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
cut no seeing it right please
 

411
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,590
cut no seeing it right please
cycle one and then if we do this head

412
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
cycle one and then if we do this head
 

413
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,870
cycle one and then if we do this head
so it should pretend it should

414
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
so it should pretend it should
 

415
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,910

you should put uh print the force right

416
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
you should put uh print the force right
 

417
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,230
you should put uh print the force right
yes exactly so how can we check how can

418
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
yes exactly so how can we check how can

how can we check if it's uh i mean let's
 

423
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,550
how can we check if it's uh i mean let's
see

424

see
 

425
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,509
see
if if we point us for the cycle how how

426
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
if if we point us for the cycle how how
 

427
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,069
if if we point us for the cycle how how
do we do

428
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
do we do
 

429
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,949
do we do
it if we create a list with a cycle

430
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
it if we create a list with a cycle
 

431
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,990

let's see
 

433
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,509
let's see
uh look we can do this p dot next now

434
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
uh look we can do this p dot next now
 

435
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,150
uh look we can do this p dot next now
let's point

436
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
let's point
 

437
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,350
let's point
to head next no

438
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
to head next no
 

439
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,670
to head next no
all right okay so now you have the cycle

440
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
all right okay so now you have the cycle
 

441
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,190
all right okay so now you have the cycle
yeah does it have a cycle now

442
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
yeah does it have a cycle now
 

443
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,150
yeah does it have a cycle now
now now you have two right yeah because

444
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
now now you have two right yeah because
 

445
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,030
now now you have two right yeah because
we continue

446
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
we continue
 

447
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,990

second approach let's cycle twice okay

452
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
second approach let's cycle twice okay
 

453
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,430
second approach let's cycle twice okay
well let's do it remember the fast and

454
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
well let's do it remember the fast and
 

455
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,110
well let's do it remember the fast and
slow thing

456
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
slow thing
 

457
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,590
slow thing
yeah the fastest is closing let's cycle

458
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
yeah the fastest is closing let's cycle
 

459
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,190
