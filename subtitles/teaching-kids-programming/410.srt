1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,279
go hello

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,759
hello mr mr right now right yeah

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,440
okay so what did you learn yesterday if

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,679
we learned about apple captain gaming

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,000
yeah yeah yeah okay so now and look this

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,800
is the source code yeah let's go uh

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,560
reveal this on it yeah we can press

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,960
yeah yeah yeah yeah you see we can press

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,800
left and right yeah so this is move left

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,600
and then we set the button a to move

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,359
left

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,279
this is the game over yeah i changed a

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,840
little bit look i call this if not game

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,239
is running we just return yeah okay if

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,559
not game is running then we just don't

16
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,360
do anything with the control

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,920
uh reset the game yeah we said the game

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,079
we saw the game so when we press the a

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,000
and b together if the apple has not

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,719
fallen on the ground we just ignore it

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
yeah just to avoid people making me stay

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,480
by pressing the this a and b together

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,239
when the apple is still falling right

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,199
yeah that's what it means and when we

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,879
reset the game it sets the score to zero

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,960
sex the apple

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,000
to a random position

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,960
yeah in the top row and resume again and

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,799
then ap this is the step move right okay

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,520
with a bit more right

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,400
get

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,479
current delay you know the faster higher

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,400
score less delay faster apple falling

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,479
speed yeah got it

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
okay so this is the main logic so now

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,280
today we're going to let the computer

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,720
play

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,680
right so we don't want to play yeah

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,720
we're not working with the player

40
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,799
[Music]

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,560
yeah so how do we make the computer play

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,200
what's your strategy if you're a

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,640
computer what do you how do you play um

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,920
like

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,840
so first of all we just

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
like

47
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,799
if like um

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,680
you just

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,360
go for like the

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,759
quick quick quickest the shortest path

51
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,119
yeah like if you're there and then

52
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,119
if you're here i never i was

53
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,799
so basically yeah the emperor is here

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,560
the airport here and this is your bow

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,439
yeah this is about so if it's on the

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,560
left you just go left yeah all right and

57
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,599
if the upper is here and then the bow is

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,360
there

59
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,520
if the upper is on the right just go

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,480
right yeah this is one strategy the most

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,520
simplest one is just towards it and just

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,200
remember that we can wrap the

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,080
the bow right so what does it mean it

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,160
means that look if we uh let's place a b

65
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,319
if we go left and you'll go from the

66
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,640
right if you go right from to the most

67
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,879
the rightmost place you

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,280
turn your left up to the left yeah so so

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,760
we can we can actually add these

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
to the check so first of all let's say

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,640
define

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,120
a

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,000
computer okay computer play

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,920
okay this is the function

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,599
we want to call and then we just put it

76
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,840
here

77
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,160
yeah okay

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,080
black computer place okay so it

79
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,040
now it does nothing but we can do this

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,120
yeah

81
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,000
so this is actually kind of the most the

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,400
simplest artificial intelligence yeah

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,640
artificial intelligence it's called

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,959
decision rules if

85
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,360
left is shorter we go from to the left

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,159
if right is your good right

87
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
right

88
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,599
yeah so if

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
decision rules decision tree is

90
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,760
basically something like okay

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,920
if something then do something a

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,319
prediction if something condition and do

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,599
something for example like if

94
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,760
today

95
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,840
is april

96
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,200
someday in april right

97
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,879
then tomorrow

98
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,400
before barbecue

99
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,519
that's right or something like that yeah

100
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,360
this is if

101
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,640
we have the barbecue yeah yeah we can do

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,879
it

103
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,239
this year as well so barbecue so learn

104
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,239
prediction yeah we're going to do that

105
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,440
okay so now look

106
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,760
look here okay but first of all if it's

107
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,280
the same look at the the position like

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,239
this x apple right f of x

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,280
f of x yeah the horizon position equals

110
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,239
the

111
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,840
f of

112
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,640
x yeah

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,439
uh x okay and then

114
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,920
if

115
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,840
first of all we have to check look if

116
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,280
if the vowel

117
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,040
dot x

118
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,199
equals f of x

119
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,359
right so if we are right

120
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,320
if we have the bao is right after the

121
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,360
apple

122
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,400
below the apple so what should we do

123
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,639
what should we do in this case

124
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,240
look if apple are here

125
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,880
and then you are just right below it

126
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,880
what should we do

127
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,759
nothing yeah just do nothing so we just

128
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,600
do nothing

129
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,280
and then return yeah because

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,199
do nothing it doesn't need to to

131
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,000
uh to do anything right

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:53,360
so another way is that if power

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,360
dot x is smaller than f of the x air x

134
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,840
right so the upper is on the right hand

135
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,840
side

136
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,520
right so we can just move right right

137
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,880
simple as that

138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,639
yeah

139
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,039
let's move left there that's the simple

140
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,919
logic without taking without considering

141
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,720
if

142
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,800
we can con we can actually grab our bow

143
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,240
from the other

144
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,360
the other side right

145
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,680
okay so so can we try left look

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,440
does it work okay now

147
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,800
yeah you see

148
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,479
okay

149
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,639
make sense

150
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,360
yeah it's actually doing that right yeah

151
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,800
yeah look but you will go for the look

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,039
the apple is the

153
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
ball is here the airport is here

154
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,639
it will actually move right instead of

155
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,960
move level because move left is the

156
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,120
faster right but it says okay because

157
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,120
it's on the right 11.

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,600
okay okay because it's too far yeah yeah

159
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,720
it's too far to get it right this is the

160
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,360
this is the thing right because if

161
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,240
if the apple is uh here okay so let's

162
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,720
say if apple is at least four two right

163
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,160
and then we are on the left

164
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,960
so what will happen

165
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,280
it takes one two three four to go to the

166
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,800
right but at that time the apple has

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,600
fallen on the ground

168
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,600
it doesn't catch it in time right

169
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,280
so that's why at least accurate or

170
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
sometimes but

171
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
it's not

172
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,080
super smart right yeah it's not smart so

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,240
we can fly

174
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,000
that's why i lose but so let's but

175
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,759
that's the basic version right that's

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
the basic version so first of all we

177
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,600
need to define the cost of moving that

178
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,039
and cost the moving line right

179
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,880
right so how do we

180
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,400
check if the costs are moving left and

181
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,280
close to moving right

182
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,759
so first of all we say close

183
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,520
so let's look if about

184
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,919
so let's say instead of

185
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,160
let's just do this okay custom moving

186
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,400
that moving right cost

187
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,759
of moving right

188
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,400
is

189
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,240
is upper

190
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,599
x minus about

191
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,919
x all right

192
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,840
yeah it's on the right hand side but but

193
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,960
again we have one more choice of moving

194
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,400
left so

195
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,680
cost of

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,919
moving

197
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,160
right okay okay uh left

198
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,160
left

199
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,080
cost of moving that you can still move

200
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,840
left equals

201
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,840
equals what it was what

202
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,039
so so let's see this this let's do this

203
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,360
a little bit here so um apple is here

204
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,720
right apple is here and i'm here the bar

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,599
is here

206
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,680
so you can move left move right the cost

207
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,479
will be the distance will be least minus

208
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,080
this right but you can also move to the

209
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,840
other hand side right

210
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,800
yeah and what's the cost

211
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,800
it's 5 plus

212
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,080
it's phi plus 1 plus the

213
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,319
these

214
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,520
so how do we get this

215
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,680
so what's the

216
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,879
mathematics look how do we calculate the

217
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,000
mathematics

218
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,639
so the distance is it equals this

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,840
distance right equals distance

220
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,639
plus this distance yeah all right yeah

221
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,000
so what is the equal the overall this is

222
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,599
five

223
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,160
this is five right five pixels

224
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,520
is it five pixels

225
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,400
five pixels so overall five pixel

226
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,000
and

227
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,560
we want to calculate the distance

228
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,240
between these and this

229
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,720
right so it's actually 5 minus this bit

230
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,560
this bit is 5 minus this

231
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,640
this bit is these right so it's 5

232
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,880
minus f of

233
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,880
f minus apple

234
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,120
upper

235
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,560
pi minus alpha is this actually this bit

236
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,880
yeah yeah

237
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,240
because look this is five

238
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,399
minus apple

239
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,880
is this bit plus

240
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,000
plus this yeah so plus

241
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,240
plus the power right the position yeah

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,080
so that that's the simple mess yeah

243
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,959
so it's five uh

244
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,760
yeah five minus f plus plus okay

245
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,839
so it's five

246
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,480
minus

247
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
up

248
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
plus

249
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,080
wow

250
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,880
i could possibly do this as a second uh

251
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,880
x

252
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
just to save the variable so we can just

253
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,560
use this

254
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,000
instead of calling this method to save

255
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,640
us

256
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,640
time okay

257
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,800
okay

258
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,760
this is the cost of moving

259
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,399
uh left and close moving right

260
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,320
yeah yeah exactly okay so now look this

261
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,680
is closer moving left custom moving

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
right but

263
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,720
uh

264
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,160
okay so that actually look because this

265
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,399
is position we have to put it here right

266
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,720
yeah because this is the position of the

267
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,120
lunar but on the other hand only on the

268
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,320
other hand side when the apple is

269
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,360
smaller than

270
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,279
bar x so it's the opposite so

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,519
it

272
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,360
so if apple is here

273
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,320
i know your control is here

274
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,480
the cost of moving left is

275
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,079
this is simple yeah you just calculate

276
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,440
the difference there

277
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,240
okay so

278
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,959
the

279
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,600
cost of moving that

280
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:28,160
equals equals one equals the power x

281
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,880
bar x minus f of x right

282
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,040
look this is now about about here here

283
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,040
is

284
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,399
is than f of x

285
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,600
right on the right hand side and then

286
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,640
now cos

287
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,760
of

288
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,079
moving right equals one

289
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,800
so it's the same it's actually the same

290
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,839
so

291
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:04,160
so look if if cursor moving right is

292
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,959
this big plus this big okay

293
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,040
this is the whole pixel yeah so it's 5

294
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,760
minus these

295
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,440
plus this 5 minus power

296
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,040
so 5 minus five

297
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,880
plus pepper

298
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,720
okay so let's do this

299
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,680
okay now what should we do

300
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,839
i have we have calculated two uh

301
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,519
two variables moving the glucose from

302
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,040
moving right and the costs are moving

303
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,079
left and what we prefer which way

304
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,079
which way we prefer

305
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,839
look there are two situations basically

306
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,240
this is just to check which

307
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,920
the position the position if if the

308
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,560
apple is on the right hand side or on

309
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,880
the left hand side of that bar right

310
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,040
and now based on this i have two

311
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,600
i've computed two

312
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,440
uh cost one the cost of moving that and

313
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
the cursor moving right so which one we

314
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,120
should choose

315
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
choose which one the bigger one or

316
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,519
smaller one

317
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,240
yeah of course the smaller one the

318
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,440
bigger the better again so if cost of

319
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,639
moving left

320
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,279
is smaller and closer moving right

321
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,880
then we move left all right

322
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,200
all right

323
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,519
all right all right so we can just move

324
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,120
right right

325
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,519
okay that might be a situation the

326
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,639
moving level equals to moving right now

327
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,279
we don't care right yeah okay let's try

328
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,800
this to see if it works okay

329
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,399
so you you'll be

330
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,320
you'll be super clever look look it

331
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,800
turns on the other side right you see

332
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
yeah okay very slow

333
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,560
don't worry

334
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,639
you will be moving the apple will be

335
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,240
moving faster and faster

336
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,200
right

337
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
faster

338
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,600
okay so let's wait a little bit look

339
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,519
look now it takes this shorter cut yeah

340
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,639
yeah instead of going

341
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,560
all the way

342
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,560
so you would never die so this this

343
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,279
version will never die

344
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,560
it will never get more over right

345
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,320
okay look

346
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,680
because it's always picking the

347
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,639
shortest

348
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,560
yeah 30s right

349
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:13,440
wow

350
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,440
so i i ideally eventually will be like

351
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,279
yeah

352
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
so look look it's getting faster and

353
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,600
faster

354
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,360
wow the human being cannot make such a

355
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,920
uh

356
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,440
cannot react so fast yeah look look how

357
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,760
can you play like that

358
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,279
the computer will never never

359
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,600
never uh

360
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,480
yeah yeah the computer will never make

361
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,399
the mistake right yeah yeah you see so

362
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,079
do you get it look this is the computer

363
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,120
play the artificial intelligence the

364
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,839
basic

365
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,680
is called decision rules yeah decision

366
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,760
rules so basically it's based on

367
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,399
checking the field condition and pick

368
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,839
the best right so so what's the cost of

369
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,120
moving that what's the cost of moving

370
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,240
right okay now okay moving that is

371
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,320
is

372
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,639
the cost is smaller the distance smaller

373
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,800
quicker now we keep preferred moving

374
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,800
back otherwise

375
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,399
at the beginning we we implement a very

376
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,240
basic one which is just that just check

377
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,320
okay if apple is on the right-hand side

378
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,320
we move to the right if apple is on the

379
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,760
left-hand side we move to the left if

380
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,279
apple is

381
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,800
right above us

382
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,360
we do nothing

383
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,600
this is decision

384
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,120
tree decision doing so

385
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,279
artificial intelligence you know what

386
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,600
artificial intelligence

387
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,519
the intelligence of computer

388
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
yeah how the computer thinks okay look

389
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,079
easy

390
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,040
yeah

391
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,920
okay

392
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,360
make sense okay the last step is we just

393
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,560
put this

394
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,480
yeah we'll just

395
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,720
just download it and then let's see if

396
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,279
we download it here

397
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,279
download

398
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,680
okay download and then

399
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,320
it

400
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,320
okay and then let's copy it to micro bit

401
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,560
16

402
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,560
complete 20 43

403
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,920
is

404
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,639
and that you downloaded the wrong one

405
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,320
okay

406
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,240
yeah okay so

407
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,600
that that's the basic that's the it for

408
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,680
today okay so

409
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,320
what have you learned today about how to

410
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,839
make computer play yeah artificial

411
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,639
intelligence yeah artificial

412
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,519
intelligence ai yeah decision rules this

413
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,639
is the

414
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,199
basic

415
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,320
one the most simplest hey the computers

416
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,399
are lost

417
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,399
how how did you do that you never

418
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,600
oh yeah yeah i know i know because i why

419
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,800
because i haven't turned off the control

420
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,639
so look i you can still press

421
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,759
the control right

422
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,519
when the computer play so you you you

423
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,079
just intentionally make the computer

424
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,360
loose right yeah then computer will lose

425
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,120
it okay

426
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,030
okay that's it for today say bye to

427
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,000
people bye-bye

428
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:30,440
[Music]

429
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,440
okay okay bye-bye
