3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,870

yeah today we can't talk about a

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
yeah today we can't talk about a
 

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,070
yeah today we can't talk about a
string complex you know what's complex

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
string complex you know what's complex
 

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,109
string complex you know what's complex
complex complex compressed

8
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,119
complex complex compressed
 

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,150
complex complex compressed
and decompressed if you

10
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,160
and decompressed if you
 

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,509
and decompressed if you
press it and you not press it

12
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
press it and you not press it
 

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,830
press it and you not press it
kind of the compress is you make a big

14
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
kind of the compress is you make a big
 

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,070
kind of the compress is you make a big
thing into a smaller thing

16
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
thing into a smaller thing
 

17
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,950
thing into a smaller thing
yeah but you can always restore look

18
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
yeah but you can always restore look
 

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,830
yeah but you can always restore look
alright

20
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
alright
 

21
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,389
alright
from a bit to the small is complex yeah

22
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:34,399
from a bit to the small is complex yeah
 

23
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,910
from a bit to the small is complex yeah
complex

24
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,920
complex
 

25
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,470
complex
and then if you can restore it that's

26
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
and then if you can restore it that's
 

27
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,510
and then if you can restore it that's
the complex

28
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
the complex
 

29
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,430
the complex
yeah yeah in what cases we need a

30
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
yeah yeah in what cases we need a
 

31
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,430
yeah yeah in what cases we need a
complexion and decompression for example

32
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
complexion and decompression for example
 

33
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,830
complexion and decompression for example
like if you want to send a big

34
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
like if you want to send a big
 

35
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,549
like if you want to send a big
big thing yeah over internet you want to

36
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
big thing yeah over internet you want to
 

37
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,430
big thing yeah over internet you want to
send a picture

38
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
send a picture
 

39
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,790
send a picture
right to your friend but the picture is

40
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
right to your friend but the picture is
 

41
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,510
right to your friend but the picture is
very big

42
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
very big
 

43
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,910
very big
it takes time so in this case we can

44
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
it takes time so in this case we can
 

45
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,750
it takes time so in this case we can
complex the picture

46
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,760
complex the picture
 

47
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,470
complex the picture
yeah to a smaller size and then we send

48
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
yeah to a smaller size and then we send
 

49
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,229
yeah to a smaller size and then we send
it to your friend and your friend

50
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
it to your friend and your friend
 

51
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,149
it to your friend and your friend
when you when your friends get it you

52
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
when you when your friends get it you
 

53
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,910
when you when your friends get it you
will decompress so you can

54
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
will decompress so you can
 

55
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,469
will decompress so you can
see the original picture that's complex

56
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
see the original picture that's complex
 

57
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,230
see the original picture that's complex
compaction and decompression

58
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
compaction and decompression
 

59
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,950
compaction and decompression
complexities make this big thing small

60
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
complexities make this big thing small
 

61
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,910
complexities make this big thing small
become practices

62
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
become practices
 

63
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,789
become practices
restore it to to make the small things

64
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
restore it to to make the small things
 

65
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,469
restore it to to make the small things
you know big again yeah i'm

66
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
you know big again yeah i'm
 

67
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,749
you know big again yeah i'm
small yeah okay so this is the concept

68
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
small yeah okay so this is the concept
 

69
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,070
small yeah okay so this is the concept
so

70
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
so
 

71
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,230
so
today we want to complex the string but

72
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
today we want to complex the string but
 

73
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,990
today we want to complex the string but
not necessarily we can decompress it for

74
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
not necessarily we can decompress it for
 

75
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,630
not necessarily we can decompress it for
example like

76
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
example like
 

77
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,670
example like
look a a a b b

78
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
look a a a b b
 

79
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,710
look a a a b b
c b d e

80
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
c b d e
 

81
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,749
c b d e
e okay doesn't have to be an alphabet no

82
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
e okay doesn't have to be an alphabet no
 

83
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,630
e okay doesn't have to be an alphabet no
no it doesn't look

84
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
no it doesn't look
 

85
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,510
no it doesn't look
this one look there are three a yeah

86
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
this one look there are three a yeah
 

87
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,230
this one look there are three a yeah
three a

88
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
three a
 

89
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,510
three a
two b one c two d what two e yeah

90
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
two b one c two d what two e yeah
 

91
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,510
two b one c two d what two e yeah
two d okay look if i have a lot of e

92
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
two d okay look if i have a lot of e
 

93
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,789
two d okay look if i have a lot of e
here so how can you

94
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
here so how can you
 

95
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,950
here so how can you
complex this one we have one kind of

96
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
complex this one we have one kind of
 

97
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,350
complex this one we have one kind of
thing it's called run dance con

98
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
thing it's called run dance con
 

99
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,550
thing it's called run dance con
one dance okay one length what's one

running runner is encoding look a a how

104
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
running runner is encoding look a a how
 

105
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,350
running runner is encoding look a a how
many a's

106
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
many a's
 

107
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,749
many a's
three three a then i took three how many

108

three three a then i took three how many
 

109
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,550
three three a then i took three how many
ones will be one thing let's even one

110
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
ones will be one thing let's even one
 

111
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,390
ones will be one thing let's even one
season let's just put c one two three

112
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
season let's just put c one two three
 

113
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,350
season let's just put c one two three
yeah

114
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
yeah
 

115
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,110
yeah
and how many five five so which one is

116
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
and how many five five so which one is
 

117
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,710
and how many five five so which one is
shorter which one is longer

118
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
shorter which one is longer
 

119
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,990
shorter which one is longer
five e no no one thing this is this this

120
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
five e no no one thing this is this this
 

121
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,589
five e no no one thing this is this this
string is longer or this string is

122
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
string is longer or this string is
 

123
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,309
string is longer or this string is
longer yeah

124
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
longer yeah
 

125
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,030
longer yeah
the same look how many characters one

126
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
the same look how many characters one
 

127
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,150
the same look how many characters one
two three four five

128
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
two three four five
 

129
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,470
two three four five
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

130
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
 

131
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,229
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
thirteen

132
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
thirteen
 

133
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,309
thirteen
smaller look this one is one two three

134
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
smaller look this one is one two three
 

135
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,630
smaller look this one is one two three
four five six seven eight nine

136
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
four five six seven eight nine
 

137
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,110
four five six seven eight nine
so i have nine characters this one is 13

138
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
so i have nine characters this one is 13
 

139
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,470
so i have nine characters this one is 13
characters

140
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
characters
 

141
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,309
characters
so what does it mean this one is shorter

142
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
so what does it mean this one is shorter
 

143
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,670
so what does it mean this one is shorter
right so

144
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
right so
 

145
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,229
right so
if i want to send this message to your

146
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
if i want to send this message to your
 

147
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,110
if i want to send this message to your
friend

148
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120

right and i need to send it 13
 

151
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,270
right and i need to send it 13
characters

152
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
characters
 

153
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,030
characters
and which is better if i can send it

154
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
and which is better if i can send it
 

155
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,309
and which is better if i can send it
nine characters

156
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:56,319
nine characters
 

157
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,990
nine characters
which is better so for example your

158
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
which is better so for example your
 

159
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,390
which is better so for example your
friend

160
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
friend
 

161
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,550
friend
gets this message this is complex

162
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
gets this message this is complex
 

163
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,990
gets this message this is complex
message like he can

164
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
message like he can
 

165
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,550
message like he can
decompress it look he can decompress it

166
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
decompress it look he can decompress it
 

167
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,910
decompress it look he can decompress it
okay three a then

168
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
okay three a then
 

169
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,589

he knows three a two b okay two b

170
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
he knows three a two b okay two b
 

171
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,790
he knows three a two b okay two b
one c two d five e

172
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
one c two d five e
 

173
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,070
one c two d five e
you doesn't make sense yeah

174
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
you doesn't make sense yeah
 

175
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,550
you doesn't make sense yeah
does it make sense yeah yeah why we need

176
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
does it make sense yeah yeah why we need
 

177
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,229
does it make sense yeah yeah why we need
the compaction so look it because it's

178
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
the compaction so look it because it's
 

179
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,270
the compaction so look it because it's
too big

180
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
too big
 

181
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,350
too big
for example there are 100 e's here and

182
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
for example there are 100 e's here and
 

183
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,830
for example there are 100 e's here and
you want to write it 100 times that's

184
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
you want to write it 100 times that's
 

185
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,030
you want to write it 100 times that's
that's going to take time yes but i can

186
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
that's going to take time yes but i can
 

187
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,470
that's going to take time yes but i can
just run

188
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
just run
 

189
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,110
just run
change this to 100 counting right so you

190
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
change this to 100 counting right so you
 

191
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,670
change this to 100 counting right so you
will still

192
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
will still
 

193
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,910
will still
be 10 characters and you'll be faster

194
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
be 10 characters and you'll be faster
 

195
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,990
be 10 characters and you'll be faster
right and when your friends get it

196
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
right and when your friends get it
 

197
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,190
right and when your friends get it
then you can restore yeah yeah then your

198
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
then you can restore yeah yeah then your
 

199
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,990
then you can restore yeah yeah then your
friends can

200
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
friends can
 

201
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,990
friends can
decompress it yeah that's what it means

202
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
decompress it yeah that's what it means
 

203
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,750
decompress it yeah that's what it means
compression the compression doesn't make

204
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
compression the compression doesn't make
 

205
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,470
compression the compression doesn't make
sense

206
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
sense
 

207
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,509
sense
right yeah okay so today our job is

208
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
right yeah okay so today our job is
 

209
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,429
right yeah okay so today our job is
slightly simpler so look look

210
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
slightly simpler so look look
 

211
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,470
slightly simpler so look look
a a bbbc dddde and

a a bbbc dddde and
 

213
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,630
a a bbbc dddde and
you need to tell me the complex version

214
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
you need to tell me the complex version
 

215
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,670
you need to tell me the complex version
is a b

216
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
is a b
 

217
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,710
is a b
c d e that's it you see so

218
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
c d e that's it you see so
 

219
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,990
c d e that's it you see so
any consecutive any consecutive

220
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,000
any consecutive any consecutive
 

221
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,110
any consecutive any consecutive
characters

222
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
characters
 

223
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,910
characters
you just need one yeah they compress

224
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
you just need one yeah they compress
 

225
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,270
you just need one yeah they compress
into one

226
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
into one
 

227
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,189
into one
yeah doesn't make sense

228
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199

 

229
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,629

how can we do it oh oh

230
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
how can we do it oh oh
 

231
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,710
how can we do it oh oh
uh uh

232

it
 

239
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,430
it
maybe you can use notebook i don't know

240
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
maybe you can use notebook i don't know

[Music]
quite close erica so look can you

254
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
quite close erica so look can you
 

255
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,629
quite close erica so look can you
explain again please

256
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
explain again please
 

257
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,510
explain again please
okay so if it's the first one character

258
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
okay so if it's the first one character
 

259
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,909
okay so if it's the first one character
a

260
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
a
 

261
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,150
a
and then you put it in and then you try

262
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
and then you put it in and then you try
 

263
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,310
and then you put it in and then you try
if it's the same as the previous one

264
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
if it's the same as the previous one
 

265
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,950
if it's the same as the previous one
you don't put you skip skip right and

266
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
you don't put you skip skip right and
 

267
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,990
you don't put you skip skip right and
then the next one

268
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
then the next one
 

269
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,550
then the next one
you put it because it's different right

270
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
you put it because it's different right
 

271
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,390
you put it because it's different right
you put it and then it is the same

272
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
you put it and then it is the same
 

273
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,990
you put it and then it is the same
skip it different put it different put

274
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
skip it different put it different put
 

275
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,710
skip it different put it different put
it

276
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
it
 

277
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,510
it
this same different e

278
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520

 

279
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,590

okay so yeah that's a very good approach

280
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
okay so yeah that's a very good approach
 

281
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,110
okay so yeah that's a very good approach
so listen

282
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
so listen
 

283
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,230
so listen
so so we just basically check if

284
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
so so we just basically check if
 

285
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,469
so so we just basically check if
the previous characters is the same and

286
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
the previous characters is the same and
 

287
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,830
the previous characters is the same and
the first one we definitely put it

288
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
the first one we definitely put it
 

289
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,430
the first one we definitely put it
because there's no previous character

290
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
because there's no previous character
 

291
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,070
because there's no previous character
right

292
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
right
 

293
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,710
right
yes i'm right okay can we write this so

294
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
yes i'm right okay can we write this so
 

295
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,070
yes i'm right okay can we write this so
today we'll be writing this

296
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
today we'll be writing this
 

297
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,150
today we'll be writing this
this is simple okay so look define

298
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
this is simple okay so look define
 

299
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,629
this is simple okay so look define
complex complex or complex s

300
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
complex complex or complex s
 

301
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,510
complex complex or complex s
and c okay let's say the answer your

302
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
and c okay let's say the answer your
 

303
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,390
and c okay let's say the answer your
answer will be

304
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
answer will be
 

305
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,629
answer will be
at the beginning is the empty string

306
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
at the beginning is the empty string
 

307
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,430
at the beginning is the empty string
right

308
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
right
 

309
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,629
right
and then look if four

310
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639

 

311
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,870

four look if we want to have a previous

312
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
four look if we want to have a previous
 

313
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,070
four look if we want to have a previous
one here previous

314
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
one here previous
 

315
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,230
one here previous
previous equals num right because

316
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
previous equals num right because
 

317
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,830
previous equals num right because
beginning here

318
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
beginning here
 

319
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,510
beginning here
for i in s

320
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
for i in s
 

321
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,830
for i in s
right look if

322
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840

 

323
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,870

if current string is not equal to

324
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
if current string is not equal to
 

325
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,390
if current string is not equal to
previous one

326
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
previous one
 

327
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,950
previous one
right right if it's not equal to

328
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
right right if it's not equal to
 

329
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,749
right right if it's not equal to
previous one

330
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
previous one
 

331
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,029
previous one
what should we do we we append it to the

332
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
what should we do we we append it to the
 

333
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,790
what should we do we we append it to the
current string right

334
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
current string right
 

335
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,189
current string right
all right all right and then previous

336
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
all right all right and then previous
 

337
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,629
all right all right and then previous
equals i right

338
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
equals i right
 

339
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,830
equals i right
right does it make sense yeah and then

340
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
right does it make sense yeah and then
 

341
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,830
right does it make sense yeah and then
return

342

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,469
answer right does it make sense eric
can you check does it make sense doesn't

346
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
can you check does it make sense doesn't
 

347
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:53,350
can you check does it make sense doesn't
make sense

348
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360

 

349
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,990

yeah okay so look because this is the

350
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
yeah okay so look because this is the
 

351
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,270
yeah okay so look because this is the
string direct

352
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
string direct
 

353
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,110
string direct
you know we're manipulating the string

354
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
you know we're manipulating the string
 

355
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,870
you know we're manipulating the string
we are adding adding the

356
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
we are adding adding the
 

357
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,430
we are adding adding the
string uh append the string to it it

358
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
string uh append the string to it it
 

359
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,550
string uh append the string to it it
might be slow you have to

360
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
might be slow you have to
 

361
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,830
might be slow you have to
string my uh string

362
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
string my uh string
 

363
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,830
string my uh string
connect connect the string in the python

364
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
connect connect the string in the python
 

365
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,150
connect connect the string in the python
is quite slow so we can do this eric we

366
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
is quite slow so we can do this eric we
 

367
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,110
is quite slow so we can do this eric we
can do this at least

368
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
can do this at least
 

369
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,230
can do this at least
yeah we can put a list this is simple if

370
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
yeah we can put a list this is simple if
 

371
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,270
yeah we can put a list this is simple if
i

372
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
i
 

373
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,749
i
not equals previous one and answer would

374
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
not equals previous one and answer would
 

375
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,430
not equals previous one and answer would
be dot append

376
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
be dot append
 

377
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,909
be dot append
apparent we can append the i right and

378
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
apparent we can append the i right and
 

379
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,710
apparent we can append the i right and
then look

380
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
then look
 

381
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,350
then look
return answer because answer is a list

382
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
return answer because answer is a list
 

383
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,390

400
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
this if this is answer and how do we
 

401
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,150
this if this is answer and how do we
make this abc remember

409
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:18,869

what happened if you press dot john what

410
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879

 

411
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,909

people are watching you

412
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
people are watching you
 

413
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,110
people are watching you
yeah people are watching your dance

yeah people are watching your dance
okay so all right look look here we are

416
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
okay so all right look look here we are
 

417
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,830
okay so all right look look here we are
using the previous right

418
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
using the previous right
 

419
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,430
using the previous right
but we don't need to store the previous

420
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
but we don't need to store the previous
 

421
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,670
but we don't need to store the previous
if we iterate the index we don't need to

422
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
if we iterate the index we don't need to
 

423
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,310
if we iterate the index we don't need to
uh start it in previous right because

424
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,320
uh start it in previous right because
 

425
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,949
uh start it in previous right because
the previous is always is previous right

426
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
the previous is always is previous right
 

427
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,750
the previous is always is previous right
so we can remove this all right and then

428
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
so we can remove this all right and then
 

429
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,070
so we can remove this all right and then
we

430
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
we
 

431
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,350
we
iterate this range we turn the range

432
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
iterate this range we turn the range
 

433
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,550
iterate this range we turn the range
range length s

434
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
range length s
 

435
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,949
range length s
okay and then how how do we do this look

436
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
okay and then how how do we do this look
 

437
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,949
okay and then how how do we do this look
look then we can say if

438
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
look then we can say if
 

439
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,509
look then we can say if
i equals zero if the first one if it's

440
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
i equals zero if the first one if it's
 

441
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,550
i equals zero if the first one if it's
the first character

442
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
the first character
 

443
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,949
the first character
we put it right o or what

444
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
we put it right o or what
 

445
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,990
we put it right o or what
or s i not

446
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
or s i not
 

447
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,470
or s i not
equal to s i minus one right because

448
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
equal to s i minus one right because
 

449
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,790
equal to s i minus one right because
that's its previous one then

450
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
that's its previous one then
 

451
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,829
that's its previous one then
there was answer dot append

452
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
there was answer dot append
 

453
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,710
there was answer dot append
open what can you tell me i plan what

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
open what can you tell me i plan what
 

455
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,190
open what can you tell me i plan what
however

456
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
however
 

457
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,110
however
apparent what if it's the first

458
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
apparent what if it's the first
 

459
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,790
apparent what if it's the first
character all the current character is

460
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
character all the current character is
 

461
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,670
character all the current character is
not equal to the

462
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
not equal to the
 

463
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,790
not equal to the
previous character s i we want to append

464
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
previous character s i we want to append
 

465
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,070
previous character s i we want to append
the current character

466
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
the current character
 

467
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,750
the current character
and then we don't need this previous for

468
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
and then we don't need this previous for
 

469
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,110
and then we don't need this previous for
i right because we already know the

470
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
i right because we already know the
 

471
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,230
i right because we already know the
previous one is

472
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
previous one is
 

473
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,030
previous one is
it's minus one and this still works okay

474
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
it's minus one and this still works okay
 

475
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,990
it's minus one and this still works okay
doesn't make sense

476
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
doesn't make sense
 

477
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,350
doesn't make sense
what's the time complexity

the previous character
 

505
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,750
the previous character
right right then we probably put it

506
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,760
right right then we probably put it
 

507
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,670
right right then we probably put it
in the current in the list there and

508
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
in the current in the list there and
 

509
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,590
in the current in the list there and
then we return we join the list by

510
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
then we return we join the list by
 

511
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,430
then we return we join the list by
empty string so we join or make it a

512
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,440
empty string so we join or make it a
 

513
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,949
empty string so we join or make it a
string right yeah

514
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
string right yeah
 

515
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,790
string right yeah
does it make sense so do you still

516
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
does it make sense so do you still
 

517
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,470
does it make sense so do you still
remember we can use the group by

518
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
remember we can use the group by
 

519
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,389
remember we can use the group by
function yeah i talked about that

520
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
function yeah i talked about that
 

521
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,509
function yeah i talked about that
some time ago guru bank yeah

522
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
some time ago guru bank yeah
 

523
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,590
some time ago guru bank yeah
guru bar is exactly the same thing look

524
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
guru bar is exactly the same thing look
 

525
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,310
guru bar is exactly the same thing look
eric if you do this already hungry

526
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
eric if you do this already hungry
 

527
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,430
eric if you do this already hungry
all right all right so look group i

528
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
all right all right so look group i
 

529
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,829
all right all right so look group i
is the function from its tools right

530
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
is the function from its tools right
 

531
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,269
is the function from its tools right
iteration tools

532
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
iteration tools
 

533
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,030
iteration tools
if you use the glue guy what happened

534
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
if you use the glue guy what happened
 

535
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,590
if you use the glue guy what happened
all right you will return

536
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
all right you will return
 

537
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,550
all right you will return
remember you will return the a b and

538
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
remember you will return the a b and
 

539
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:52,949
remember you will return the a b and
then

540
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
then
 

541
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,310
then
there will be a iterator

542
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
there will be a iterator
 

543
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,350
there will be a iterator
of a a right and then

544
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
of a a right and then
 

545
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,550
of a a right and then
b iterator of bb right

546
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
b iterator of bb right
 

547
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,470
b iterator of bb right
this is the iterator if you want to get

548
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
this is the iterator if you want to get
 

549
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,230
this is the iterator if you want to get
it you need to change this to this

550
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
it you need to change this to this
 

551
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,590
it you need to change this to this
and see an iterator of c so let's see

552
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
and see an iterator of c so let's see
 

553
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,910
and see an iterator of c so let's see
easy all these can can be converted into

554
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
easy all these can can be converted into
 

555
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:21,030
easy all these can can be converted into
one line

556
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040

 

557
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,430

again the join we want to join the list

558
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
again the join we want to join the list
 

559
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,430
again the join we want to join the list
yeah so look

560
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
yeah so look
 

561
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,509
yeah so look
at this yeah x 4

562
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
at this yeah x 4
 

563
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,350
at this yeah x 4
x comma y in group by

564
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
x comma y in group by
 

565
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,030
x comma y in group by
goodbye guru by s

566
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
goodbye guru by s
 

567
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,990
goodbye guru by s
island bracket that's it a single line

568
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
island bracket that's it a single line
 

569
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,470
island bracket that's it a single line
right

570
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
right
 

571
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,829
right
does it make sense all right guru by s

572
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
does it make sense all right guru by s
 

573
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,630
does it make sense all right guru by s
yeah remember blue by s the key will be

574
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
yeah remember blue by s the key will be
 

575
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,509
yeah remember blue by s the key will be
the

576
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
the
 

577
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,670
the
group the y value will be the list

578
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
group the y value will be the list
 

579
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,310
group the y value will be the list
of the its group right so x will be the

580
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
of the its group right so x will be the
 

581
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,110
of the its group right so x will be the
group right

582
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
group right
 

583
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,430
group right
and then i want to join the x doesn't

584
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
and then i want to join the x doesn't
 

585
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,710
and then i want to join the x doesn't
make sense right

586
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
make sense right
 

587
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,069
make sense right
yeah really does it make sense

588
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
yeah really does it make sense
 

589
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,790
yeah really does it make sense
yes okay so let

590
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800

 

591
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,790

uh so this one look at this one

592
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
uh so this one look at this one
 

593
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,350
uh so this one look at this one
remember if it's a aabb what does it

594
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
remember if it's a aabb what does it
 

595
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,030
remember if it's a aabb what does it
mean you will return the tuper

596
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
mean you will return the tuper
 

597
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,430
mean you will return the tuper
yeah guru by this group by this will

598
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
yeah guru by this group by this will
 

599
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,910
yeah guru by this group by this will
return the trooper which is what

600
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
return the trooper which is what
 

601
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,590
return the trooper which is what
a a a and then

602
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
a a a and then
 

603
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,750
a a a and then
and then a tuper a second one will be

604
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
and then a tuper a second one will be
 

605
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,030
and then a tuper a second one will be
aaa right

606
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
aaa right
 

607
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,030
aaa right
so i just want to return to this first

608
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
so i just want to return to this first
 

609
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,870
so i just want to return to this first
one which is x axis here

610
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
one which is x axis here
 

611
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,750
one which is x axis here
and at least so you'll be drawing a list

612
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
and at least so you'll be drawing a list
 

613
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,629
and at least so you'll be drawing a list
of

614
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
of
 

615
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,389
of
a b c right

616
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
a b c right
 

617
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,710
a b c right
all right john abc returns abc doesn't

618
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
all right john abc returns abc doesn't
 

619
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,150
all right john abc returns abc doesn't
make sense all right

620
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
make sense all right
 

621
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,629
make sense all right
yeah what's the space complexity

622
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639

 

623
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,430

does we do we need a space do we need a

624
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
does we do we need a space do we need a
 

625
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,110
does we do we need a space do we need a
space

626
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120

 

627
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,030

this one is hard to say because we are

628
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
this one is hard to say because we are
 

629
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,230
this one is hard to say because we are
probably using the space here

630
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
probably using the space here
 

631
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,269
probably using the space here
right everyone

632
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:10,279

 

633
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,310

implementation do you still remember we

634
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
implementation do you still remember we
 

635
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,990
implementation do you still remember we
are not using any space right we you

636
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
are not using any space right we you
 

637
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,790
are not using any space right we you
don't count

638
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:14,800
don't count
 

639
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,150
don't count
one oh one we don't call it we we don't

640
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
one oh one we don't call it we we don't
 

641
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,870
one oh one we don't call it we we don't
call the answer as the space additional

642
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
call the answer as the space additional
 

643
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,829
call the answer as the space additional
space right

644
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
space right
 

645
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,870
space right
all right yeah okay so do you still

646
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
all right yeah okay so do you still
 

647
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,750
all right yeah okay so do you still
remember you fight

648
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
remember you fight
 

649
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,710
remember you fight
every eric if i'm i'm going to write it

650
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
every eric if i'm i'm going to write it
 

651
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,310
every eric if i'm i'm going to write it
and then you tell me what to do okay

652
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
and then you tell me what to do okay
 

653
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,470
and then you tell me what to do okay
look all right answer he was this
