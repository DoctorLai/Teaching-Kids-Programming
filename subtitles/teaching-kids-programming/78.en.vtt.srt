yeah good so what did we talk about
 

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:22,710
yeah good so what did we talk about
yesterday the same leaves yeah

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720

 

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,470

thumbs up yes yes let's give it a thumbs

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
thumbs up yes yes let's give it a thumbs
 

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,990
thumbs up yes yes let's give it a thumbs
up give a thumbs up okay

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000
up give a thumbs up okay
 

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,630
up give a thumbs up okay
we're talking about breakfast

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640

 

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,870

look this is the final tree yeah so the

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
look this is the final tree yeah so the
 

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,950
look this is the final tree yeah so the
leaves are on the level one so we should

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
leaves are on the level one so we should
 

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,229
leaves are on the level one so we should
return two yeah yeah

18
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:40,239
return two yeah yeah
 

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,709
return two yeah yeah
and how about this the leaves are on

20
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
and how about this the leaves are on
 

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,069
and how about this the leaves are on
level one and number two

22
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
level one and number two
 

23
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,229
level one and number two
so we should return first remember

24
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
so we should return first remember
 

25
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,750
so we should return first remember
yesterday we talked about different

26
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
yesterday we talked about different
 

27
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,229
yesterday we talked about different
search so basically we go down the tree

28
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
search so basically we go down the tree
 

29
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,510
search so basically we go down the tree
and then the dfss remember

30
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
and then the dfss remember
 

31
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,350
and then the dfss remember
that dfs with a root and then a current

32
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
that dfs with a root and then a current
 

33
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,310
that dfs with a root and then a current
depth yeah when it goes down to the next

34
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
depth yeah when it goes down to the next
 

35
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,869
depth yeah when it goes down to the next
level

36
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
level
 

37
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,590
level
we increment the depth plus one right

38
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
we increment the depth plus one right
 

39
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,149
we increment the depth plus one right
yeah

40
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
yeah
 

41
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,190
yeah
so and now when we when we reach the

42
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200
so and now when we when we reach the
 

43
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,350
so and now when we when we reach the
leaf node how do we check if the node is

44
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
leaf node how do we check if the node is
 

45
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,800
leaf node how do we check if the node is
the leaf node

46
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:12,810
the leaf node
 

47
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,190
the leaf node
[Music]

48
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
[Music]
 

49
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,310
[Music]
that doesn't have any child yeah so lose

50
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
that doesn't have any child yeah so lose
 

51
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,749
that doesn't have any child yeah so lose
the left

52
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
the left
 

53
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,510
the left
is numb right yeah

54
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
is numb right yeah
 

55
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,149
is numb right yeah
and blue dot right is not okay so that's

56
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
and blue dot right is not okay so that's
 

57
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,749
and blue dot right is not okay so that's
the way to check if you know it's the

58
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
the way to check if you know it's the
 

59
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,390
the way to check if you know it's the
leaf node

60
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
leaf node
 

61
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,789
leaf node
when we reach the leaf node we push the

62
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
when we reach the leaf node we push the
 

63
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,429
when we reach the leaf node we push the
current

64
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
current
 

65
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,149
current
the depth of the the depth of the node

66
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
the depth of the the depth of the node
 

67
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,749
the depth of the the depth of the node
the leaf node into a set

68
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
the leaf node into a set
 

69
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,069
the leaf node into a set
right and then we finally check if the

70
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
right and then we finally check if the
 

71
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,069
right and then we finally check if the
set it contains only one element because

72
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
set it contains only one element because
 

73
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,030
set it contains only one element because
if it's only one

74
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
if it's only one
 

75
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,190
if it's only one
element it means what all the leaves are

76
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
element it means what all the leaves are
 

77
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,149
element it means what all the leaves are
on the same level

78
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
on the same level
 

79
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,469
on the same level
right yeah yeah okay so do you still

80
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,479
right yeah yeah okay so do you still
 

81
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,550
right yeah yeah okay so do you still
remember breakfast search

82
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
remember breakfast search
 

83
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,749
remember breakfast search
so what's breakfast search we travel

84
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
so what's breakfast search we travel
 

85
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,350
so what's breakfast search we travel
the notes level by level yeah so here

86
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
the notes level by level yeah so here
 

87
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,429
the notes level by level yeah so here
and then here and here and do you still

88
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
and then here and here and do you still
 

89
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,670
and then here and here and do you still
remember how we do it look this is one

90
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
remember how we do it look this is one
 

91
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,950
remember how we do it look this is one
that's two that's three and that's four

92
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
that's two that's three and that's four
 

93
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,389
that's two that's three and that's four
so if a binary tree is like that so

94
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
so if a binary tree is like that so
 

95
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,550
so if a binary tree is like that so
what kind of data structure we need to

96
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
what kind of data structure we need to
 

97
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,990
what kind of data structure we need to
use in order to

98
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
use in order to
 

99
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,430
use in order to
perform a breakfast search

100
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
perform a breakfast search
 

101
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,430
perform a breakfast search
what kind of data structure do you still

102
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
what kind of data structure do you still
 

103
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,270
what kind of data structure do you still
remember first thing

104
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
remember first thing
 

105
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,470
remember first thing
first out what's that

106
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
first out what's that
 

107
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,510
first out what's that
a key yeah first in first out q

108
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
a key yeah first in first out q
 

109
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,589
a key yeah first in first out q
okay point as well so how do we perform

110
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
okay point as well so how do we perform
 

111
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,270
okay point as well so how do we perform
this look we have a queue yeah

112
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
this look we have a queue yeah
 

113
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,830
this look we have a queue yeah
this is cube first of all it's nothing

114
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
this is cube first of all it's nothing
 

115
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,350
this is cube first of all it's nothing
yeah it's nothing

116
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
yeah it's nothing
 

117
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,910
yeah it's nothing
now i'm looking i didn't have one yeah

118
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
now i'm looking i didn't have one yeah
 

119
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,110
now i'm looking i didn't have one yeah
because i i'm going to put the elements

120
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
because i i'm going to put the elements
 

121
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,430
because i i'm going to put the elements
in

122
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
in
 

123
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,990
in
look one yeah well i'm here loot yeah

124
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
look one yeah well i'm here loot yeah
 

125
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,630
look one yeah well i'm here loot yeah
yeah

126
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
yeah
 

127
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,110
yeah
root so p so first of all i put the loop

128
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
root so p so first of all i put the loop
 

129
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,550
root so p so first of all i put the loop
first of all i put the first see in yeah

130
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
first of all i put the first see in yeah
 

131
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,710
first of all i put the first see in yeah
yeah because at the beginning i put the

132
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
yeah because at the beginning i put the
 

133
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,830
yeah because at the beginning i put the
first load in

134
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
first load in
 

135
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,110
first load in
okay and then what's the q what this is

136
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
okay and then what's the q what this is
 

137
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,470
okay and then what's the q what this is
the beginning of the queue yeah

138
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
the beginning of the queue yeah
 

139
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,309
the beginning of the queue yeah
why n this is the beginning of q yeah

140
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
why n this is the beginning of q yeah
 

141
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,350
why n this is the beginning of q yeah
now now

142
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
now now
 

143
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,390
now now
i do this the q the q is typically from

144
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
i do this the q the q is typically from
 

145
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,149
i do this the q the q is typically from
the q which is the beginning of q

146
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
the q which is the beginning of q
 

147
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,869
the q which is the beginning of q
yeah yeah which is one yeah i take it

148
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
yeah yeah which is one yeah i take it
 

149
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,949
yeah yeah which is one yeah i take it
out

150
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
out
 

151
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,550
out
okay i take it off because i have to

152
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
okay i take it off because i have to
 

153
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,229
okay i take it off because i have to
kill and then what's the

154
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
kill and then what's the
 

155
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,270
kill and then what's the
children of the one two and three okay

156
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
children of the one two and three okay
 

157
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,430
children of the one two and three okay
so then i put a q here two

158
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
so then i put a q here two
 

159
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,869
so then i put a q here two
three okay okay three is eight

160
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
three okay okay three is eight
 

161
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,670
three okay okay three is eight
look yes three is the leaf

162
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
look yes three is the leaf
 

163
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,149
look yes three is the leaf
and then i should put a level which is

164
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
and then i should put a level which is
 

165
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:32,949
and then i should put a level which is
one

166
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
one
 

167
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,789
one
yeah it's never one in in the in the

168
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
yeah it's never one in in the in the
 

169
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,350
yeah it's never one in in the in the
set okay this is one here

170
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360

 

171
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,430

two now the next item to take out from

172
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
two now the next item to take out from
 

173
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,390
two now the next item to take out from
the kill is

174
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
the kill is
 

175
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,710
the kill is
one two two okay

176
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720

 

177
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,550

what's the key what's the triad of the

178
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
what's the key what's the triad of the
 

179
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,750
what's the key what's the triad of the
four four and i put it here right

180
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
four four and i put it here right
 

181
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,390
four four and i put it here right
and the q is

182
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400

 

183
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,949

here okay so now look what's in the next

184
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
here okay so now look what's in the next
 

185
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,390
here okay so now look what's in the next
is three yeah

186
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
is three yeah
 

187
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,910
is three yeah
yeah but it doesn't have anything

188
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
yeah but it doesn't have anything
 

189
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,070
yeah but it doesn't have anything
to add that's fine and what's the next

190
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
to add that's fine and what's the next
 

191
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,350
to add that's fine and what's the next
element form it doesn't

192
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
element form it doesn't
 

193
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,830
element form it doesn't
so you should get it do you see how how

194
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
so you should get it do you see how how
 

195
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,629
so you should get it do you see how how
we use the q

196
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
we use the q
 

197
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,749
we use the q
so we take a triad from the q

198
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
so we take a triad from the q
 

199
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,830
so we take a triad from the q
which is at the beginning of q we push

200
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
which is at the beginning of q we push
 

201
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,430
which is at the beginning of q we push
each kit

202
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
each kit
 

203
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,790
each kit
into the queue and meanwhile we check

204
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
into the queue and meanwhile we check
 

205
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,189
into the queue and meanwhile we check
if the kill is the leaf now or not we

206
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
if the kill is the leaf now or not we
 

207
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,070
if the kill is the leaf now or not we
visited now

208
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
visited now
 

209
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,950
visited now
if it's the leaf now we push the level

210
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
if it's the leaf now we push the level
 

211
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,510
if it's the leaf now we push the level
okay

212
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
okay
 

213
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,189
okay
yeah so the most important thing here

214
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
yeah so the most important thing here
 

215
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,390
yeah so the most important thing here
is that we need to carry over the depths

216
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
is that we need to carry over the depths
 

217
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,110
is that we need to carry over the depths
so look this is loot one we possibly we

218
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
so look this is loot one we possibly we
 

219
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,749
so look this is loot one we possibly we
need to

220
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
need to
 

221
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,870
need to
put a zero the second element coupon so

222
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
put a zero the second element coupon so
 

223
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,230
put a zero the second element coupon so
to say it's a loop

224
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
to say it's a loop
 

225
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,270
to say it's a loop
is depth yellow and when we take it out

226
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
is depth yellow and when we take it out
 

227
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,310
is depth yellow and when we take it out
we push this kit kit now we know the

228
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
we push this kit kit now we know the
 

229
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,030
we push this kit kit now we know the
next

230
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
next
 

231
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,790
next
steps is one right because zero plus one

232
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
steps is one right because zero plus one
 

233
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,590
steps is one right because zero plus one
right

234
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
right
 

235
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,870
right
so so we when we deal with the

236
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
so so we when we deal with the
 

237
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,909
so so we when we deal with the
leaf now we know exactly what depth it

238
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
leaf now we know exactly what depth it
 

239
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,110
leaf now we know exactly what depth it
is

240
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
is
 

241
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,350
is
okay so do uh first thing first out

242
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
okay so do uh first thing first out
 

243
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,230
okay so do uh first thing first out
and then the queue do you know in python

244
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
and then the queue do you know in python
 

245
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,590
and then the queue do you know in python
what can we do

246
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
what can we do
 

247
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,830
what can we do
how what kind of data structure we can

248
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840
how what kind of data structure we can
 

249
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,670
how what kind of data structure we can
use to implement a queue

250
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
use to implement a queue
 

251
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,790
use to implement a queue
at least yeah yeah this is a list yeah

252
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
at least yeah yeah this is a list yeah
 

253
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,590
at least yeah yeah this is a list yeah
you can use the look q equals list and

254
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
you can use the look q equals list and
 

255
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,469
you can use the look q equals list and
then you can q

256
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
then you can q
 

257
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,710
then you can q
dot pop 0 right but this is not

258
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
dot pop 0 right but this is not
 

259
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,430
dot pop 0 right but this is not
01 constant because this is a list so a

260
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
01 constant because this is a list so a
 

261
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,550
01 constant because this is a list so a
better way is to

262
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
better way is to
 

263
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,070
better way is to
use this q dot dq what's the queue

264
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
use this q dot dq what's the queue
 

265
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,110
use this q dot dq what's the queue
double ndq so this this one because then

266
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
double ndq so this this one because then
 

267
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,749
double ndq so this this one because then
you can say

268
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
you can say
 

269
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,670
you can say
q dot pop left

270
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
q dot pop left
 

271
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,909
q dot pop left
yeah which is one constant this is

272
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
yeah which is one constant this is
 

273
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,950
yeah which is one constant this is
faster okay

274
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
faster okay
 

275
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,430
faster okay
yeah okay so now i'm going to write it

276
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
yeah okay so now i'm going to write it
 

277
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,150
yeah okay so now i'm going to write it
okay

278
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
okay
 

279
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,270
okay
super fast if i check

280
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
super fast if i check
 

281
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,150
super fast if i check
let's just do over maybe same okay six

282
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
let's just do over maybe same okay six
 

283
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,710
let's just do over maybe same okay six
minutes

284
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
minutes
 

285
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,830
minutes
same okay

286
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840

 

287
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,749

okay if if root

288
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
okay if if root
 

289
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,350
okay if if root
is numb if like three is none return

290
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
is numb if like three is none return
 

291
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,870
is numb if like three is none return
we can return two or fours it doesn't

292
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
we can return two or fours it doesn't
 

293
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,510
we can return two or fours it doesn't
matter okay it's a very special case

294
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
matter okay it's a very special case
 

295
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,430
matter okay it's a very special case
okay let's return true because all the

296
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
okay let's return true because all the
 

297
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,629
okay let's return true because all the
leaf nodes there are

298
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
leaf nodes there are
 

299
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,469
leaf nodes there are
none okay you can say it's true right

300
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
none okay you can say it's true right
 

301
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,909
none okay you can say it's true right
yes okay now q q

302
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
yes okay now q q
 

303
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,110
yes okay now q q
equals t q yeah

304
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
equals t q yeah
 

305
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,430
equals t q yeah
the q and then i can take a parameter i

306
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
the q and then i can take a parameter i
 

307
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,950
the q and then i can take a parameter i
put a loose note in that

308
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
put a loose note in that
 

309
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,150
put a loose note in that
so this this parameter takes a list

310
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
so this this parameter takes a list
 

311
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,230
so this this parameter takes a list
uh it uh innumerable so i put a list

312
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
uh it uh innumerable so i put a list
 

313
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,590
uh it uh innumerable so i put a list
and then put a root okay so now the list

314
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
and then put a root okay so now the list
 

315
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,830
and then put a root okay so now the list
the queue contains only one element

316
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
the queue contains only one element
 

317
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,830
the queue contains only one element
which is root okay

318
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
which is root okay
 

319
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,270
which is root okay
yes and then i need to check why

320
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
yes and then i need to check why
 

321
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,510
yes and then i need to check why
why why okay lens q

322
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
why why okay lens q
 

323
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,070
why why okay lens q
wireless element in the queue right wait

324
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
wireless element in the queue right wait
 

325
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,550
wireless element in the queue right wait
why is

326
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
why is
 

327
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,710
why is
this anime in the queue right yeah lens

328
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
this anime in the queue right yeah lens
 

329
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,390
this anime in the queue right yeah lens
is to count how many

330
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
is to count how many
 

331
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,189
is to count how many
elements in the cube then i need to take

332
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
elements in the cube then i need to take
 

333
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,110
elements in the cube then i need to take
one element from the beginning so how do

334
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
one element from the beginning so how do
 

335
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,629
one element from the beginning so how do
we do it

336
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
we do it
 

337
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,670
we do it
one element in the beginning p let's do

338
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
one element in the beginning p let's do
 

339
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:11,909
one element in the beginning p let's do
p

340
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
p
 

341
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,029
p
okay equals q dot what

342
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
okay equals q dot what
 

343
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,909
okay equals q dot what
remember what did i just say

344
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919

 

345
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,510

pop i said pop left yeah

346
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
pop i said pop left yeah
 

347
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,830
pop i said pop left yeah
yeah okay remember we are missing

348
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
yeah okay remember we are missing
 

349
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,670
yeah okay remember we are missing
something which is the

350
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
something which is the
 

351
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,070
something which is the
we need to put the depth in it so

352
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
we need to put the depth in it so
 

353
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,070
we need to put the depth in it so
instead of single animal we can do this

354
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
instead of single animal we can do this
 

355
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,270
instead of single animal we can do this
a tupa

356
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
a tupa
 

357
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,830
a tupa
root zero okay and then do this

358
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840
root zero okay and then do this
 

359
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,589
root zero okay and then do this
and okay so now we put an animal from

360
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
and okay so now we put an animal from
 

361
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,150
and okay so now we put an animal from
the beginning

362
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
the beginning
 

363
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,990
the beginning
yeah and and we also need a

364
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
yeah and and we also need a
 

365
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,270
yeah and and we also need a
a set yeah let's do a set set uh let's

366
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
a set yeah let's do a set set uh let's
 

367
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,110
a set yeah let's do a set set uh let's
let's remove this okay let's remove this

368
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
let's remove this okay let's remove this
 

369
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,309
let's remove this okay let's remove this
special case okay let's set uh

370
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
special case okay let's set uh
 

371
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,510
special case okay let's set uh
t equals set to

372
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
t equals set to
 

373
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,270
t equals set to
this is to store the num uh the

374
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
this is to store the num uh the
 

375
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,950
this is to store the num uh the
the depth value okay of the digits

376
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
the depth value okay of the digits
 

377
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,150
the depth value okay of the digits
look now p p

378
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
look now p p
 

379
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,510
look now p p
is the p 0 is the root and p 1 is the

380
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
is the p 0 is the root and p 1 is the
 

381
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,790
is the p 0 is the root and p 1 is the
depth right

382
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
depth right
 

383
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,990
depth right
so

384
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000

 

385
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,110

if p

386
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
if p
 

387
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,749
if p
0 dot left is num

388
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
0 dot left is num
 

389
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,350
0 dot left is num
right and

390
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
right and
 

391
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,630
right and
p zero dot y is num

392
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
p zero dot y is num
 

393
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,630
p zero dot y is num
so what does it mean it's like this now

394
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
so what does it mean it's like this now
 

395
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,310
so what does it mean it's like this now
right

396
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
right
 

397
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,070
right
all right yes i'm all right

398
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
all right yes i'm all right
 

399
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,110
all right yes i'm all right
so now we need to push this is

400
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
so now we need to push this is
 

401
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,470
so now we need to push this is
this one so p1 d dot at p1 right

402
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480

 

403
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,350

okay d dot s p one

404
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360

 

405
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,150

so means that when when p zero is a leaf

406
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
so means that when when p zero is a leaf
 

407
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,230
so means that when when p zero is a leaf
node

408
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
node
 

409
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,350
node
p zero instead of now we push the depth

410
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
p zero instead of now we push the depth
 

411
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,710
p zero instead of now we push the depth
into the

412
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
into the
 

413
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,070
into the
set right and uh

414
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
set right and uh
 

415
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,389
set right and uh
then that's it and if p0

416
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399

 

417
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,070

p0 left is not long then we need to push

418
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
p0 left is not long then we need to push
 

419
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,269
p0 left is not long then we need to push
it into the kill so

420
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
it into the kill so
 

421
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,190
it into the kill so
q dot append

422
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
q dot append
 

423
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,230
q dot append
attend what

424
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240

 

425
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,910

p zero dot left

426
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
p zero dot left
 

427
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,870
p zero dot left
and then p one plus one right p one is

428
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
and then p one plus one right p one is
 

429
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,470
and then p one plus one right p one is
the depth plus one

430
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
the depth plus one
 

431
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,030
the depth plus one
and the same as this one this is p0 the

432
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
and the same as this one this is p0 the
 

433
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,910
and the same as this one this is p0 the
right

434
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
right
 

435
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,949
right
and at the end we need to return one

436
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
and at the end we need to return one
 

437
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,030
and at the end we need to return one
return this is the same as yesterday do

438
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
return this is the same as yesterday do
 

439
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,310
return this is the same as yesterday do
you still remember

440
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
you still remember
 

441
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,550
you still remember
return one what do you return at the end

442
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
return one what do you return at the end
 

443
00:09:48,560 --> 00:10:02,829
return one what do you return at the end
less

444
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839

 

445
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,470

uh

446
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
uh
 

447
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,590
uh
[Music]

448
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
[Music]
 

449
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,550
[Music]
you see so look at this p you can say p0

450
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
you see so look at this p you can say p0
 

451
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,269
you see so look at this p you can say p0
p1

452
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
p1
 

453
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,430
p1
which is you can still look because this

454
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
which is you can still look because this
 

455
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,949
which is you can still look because this
one recently

456
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
one recently
 

457
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,870
one recently
you can also have this current comma

458
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
you can also have this current comma
 

459
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,550
you can also have this current comma
that equals q dot pop left

460
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
that equals q dot pop left
 

461
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,670
that equals q dot pop left
okay so in this case these values will

462
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
okay so in this case these values will
 

463
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,790
okay so in this case these values will
be

464
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
be
 

465
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,710
be
different into two so current will be

466
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
different into two so current will be
 

467
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,190
different into two so current will be
the p0 and that will be p1

468
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
the p0 and that will be p1
 

469
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,630
the p0 and that will be p1
yeah this is the one thing okay yeah

470
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
yeah this is the one thing okay yeah
 

471
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,829
yeah this is the one thing okay yeah
okay so now can you tell me

472
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
okay so now can you tell me
 

473
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,110
okay so now can you tell me
if there anything we can improve look

474
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
if there anything we can improve look
 

475
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,470
if there anything we can improve look
here

476
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
here
 

477
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,509
here
can we check can we check here

478
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
can we check can we check here
 

479
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,550
can we check can we check here
when we adding a a number

480
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
when we adding a a number
 

481
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,590
when we adding a a number
into a set we know how many numbers are

482
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
into a set we know how many numbers are
 

483
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,829
into a set we know how many numbers are
in the cell right

in the cell right
 

485
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,269
in the cell right
yeah so can we check if if the length d

486
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
yeah so can we check if if the length d
 

487
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,710
yeah so can we check if if the length d
look all right

488
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
look all right

if i said if then d
 

499
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,430
if i said if then d
bigger than one return fourth

500
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
bigger than one return fourth
 

501
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,910
bigger than one return fourth
can i do it yeah yeah because here

502
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
can i do it yeah yeah because here

already more than two elements
 

507
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,949
already more than two elements
more than one element in a set you will

508
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
more than one element in a set you will
 

509
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:31,829
more than one element in a set you will
you'll be returned

510
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
you'll be returned
 

511
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,389
you'll be returned
as four anyway right yeah because we are

512
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
as four anyway right yeah because we are
 

513
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,389
as four anyway right yeah because we are
all we are adding the numbers into the

514
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
all we are adding the numbers into the
 

515
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,030
all we are adding the numbers into the
set we are not taking away from it right

516
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
set we are not taking away from it right
 

517
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,069
set we are not taking away from it right
the set can only grow right right i'm

518
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
the set can only grow right right i'm
 

519
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:42,949
the set can only grow right right i'm
right

520
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
right
 

521
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,630

yes okay so now can i
 

523
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,030
yes okay so now can i
what should i change the return what

524
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040

 

525
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,990

look here i'll return the force and here

526
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
look here i'll return the force and here
 

527
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,269
look here i'll return the force and here
should be turn one

528
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
should be turn one
 

529
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,310
should be turn one
2 yeah yes we can two

530
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
2 yeah yes we can two
 

531
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,030

533
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,150
do you see it do you see it yes do you
understand look

534
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
understand look
 

535
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,470
understand look
because we all we our target is the

536
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
because we all we our target is the
 

537
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,590
because we all we our target is the
chest is

538
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
chest is
 

539
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,310
chest is
our target is to check if at least there

540
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
our target is to check if at least there
 

541
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,750
our target is to check if at least there
are only one element in the d

542
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
are only one element in the d
 

543
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,949
are only one element in the d
right right yeah and now

544
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
right right yeah and now
 

545
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,750
right right yeah and now
in this case when we added we we found

546
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
in this case when we added we we found
 

547
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,629
in this case when we added we we found
out that

548
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:16,639
out that
 

549
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,190
out that
if it's already more than one so there's

550
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
if it's already more than one so there's
 

551
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,470
if it's already more than one so there's
no need to continue

552
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
no need to continue
 

553
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:36,829
no need to continue
right we can just return fourth

554
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839

 

555
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,310

557
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,550

do we use the additional space i want

558
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:42,560
do we use the additional space i want
 

559
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,069
do we use the additional space i want
yes yes

560
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079

it's more than one we just quit

572
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
it's more than one we just quit
 

573
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,949
it's more than one we just quit
yeah yeah look at it yeah

574
00:12:58,949 --> 00:12:58,959
yeah yeah look at it yeah
 

575
