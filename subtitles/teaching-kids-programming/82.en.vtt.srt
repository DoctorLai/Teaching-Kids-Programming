hello hello my name is

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:03,360
hello hello my name is
 

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,349
hello hello my name is
hello mr ryan today we're going to talk

4
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:05,359
hello mr ryan today we're going to talk
 

5
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,030
hello mr ryan today we're going to talk
about binary tree

6
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,040
about binary tree
 

7
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,150
about binary tree
uh how to merge two binary trees okay so

8
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,160
uh how to merge two binary trees okay so
 

9
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,150
uh how to merge two binary trees okay so
binary tree can you remind me what are

10
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,160
binary tree can you remind me what are
 

11
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,509
binary tree can you remind me what are
binary trees

12
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
binary trees
 

13
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,150
binary trees
it's a tree with numbers so it was

14
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
it's a tree with numbers so it was
 

15
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,750
it's a tree with numbers so it was
numbers can you draw a banner tree for

16
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:17,760
numbers can you draw a banner tree for
 

17
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,189
numbers can you draw a banner tree for
daddy

18
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199

 

19
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,950

i need buying a tree it doesn't have to

20
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
i need buying a tree it doesn't have to
 

21
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,390
i need buying a tree it doesn't have to
be

22
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400
be
 

23
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,269
be
super fancy you know to spineless shoes

24
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
super fancy you know to spineless shoes
 

25
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,030
super fancy you know to spineless shoes
yes brian do you want to draw no

26
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
yes brian do you want to draw no
 

27
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,069
yes brian do you want to draw no
okay okay that's that's good

28
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
okay okay that's that's good
 

29
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,270
okay okay that's that's good
whoa that's okay that's okay

30
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,280
whoa that's okay that's okay
 

31
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,950
whoa that's okay that's okay
yeah it doesn't matter any values could

32
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
yeah it doesn't matter any values could
 

33
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,430
yeah it doesn't matter any values could
be fine yes

34
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,440
be fine yes
 

35
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,869
be fine yes
that's it okay yep so it's timing

36
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
that's it okay yep so it's timing
 

37
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,110
that's it okay yep so it's timing
except the last bit okay i don't know

38
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
except the last bit okay i don't know
 

39
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,310
except the last bit okay i don't know
what you're drawing next

40
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
what you're drawing next
 

41
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,510
what you're drawing next
the final tree is basically a tree with

42
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
the final tree is basically a tree with
 

43
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,709
the final tree is basically a tree with
notes and an edges and each no

44
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
notes and an edges and each no
 

45
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,830
notes and an edges and each no
has a most two children and each each

46
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
has a most two children and each each
 

47
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,630
has a most two children and each each
children

48
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
children
 

49
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,750
children
can have almost one parent

50
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
can have almost one parent
 

51
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:16,390
can have almost one parent
except which note which knows

52
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400

 

53
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,429

okay so this is the root look

54
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439
okay so this is the root look
 

55
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,550
okay so this is the root look
and that's the leaves okay leaves

56
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
and that's the leaves okay leaves
 

57
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,429
and that's the leaves okay leaves
it's this upside down tree okay yeah if

58
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
it's this upside down tree okay yeah if
 

59
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:25,990
it's this upside down tree okay yeah if
you look from

60
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
you look from
 

61
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,870
you look from
upside down load loads growing upwards

62
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
upside down load loads growing upwards
 

63
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,350
upside down load loads growing upwards
left

64
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360

 

65
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,590

upside down yeah that's the edges okay

66
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
upside down yeah that's the edges okay
 

67
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,190
upside down yeah that's the edges okay
so today we'll talk about

68
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
so today we'll talk about
 

69
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,990
so today we'll talk about
merge two binary trees like look one

70
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
merge two binary trees like look one
 

71
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,550
merge two binary trees like look one
like that three

72
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
like that three
 

73
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,109
like that three
four no no please good music

74
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
four no no please good music
 

75
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,149
four no no please good music
five six seven

76
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
five six seven
 

77
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,270
five six seven
okay so so now you can you tell me how

78
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
okay so so now you can you tell me how
 

79
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,230
okay so so now you can you tell me how
to merge it uh let's do this eight okay

80
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
to merge it uh let's do this eight okay
 

81
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,429
to merge it uh let's do this eight okay
so when these two magic you should give

82
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
so when these two magic you should give
 

83
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,789
so when these two magic you should give
me

84
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
me
 

85
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,389
me
six and then that should be

86
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
six and then that should be
 

87
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,749
six and then that should be
eight y and then seven

88
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
eight y and then seven
 

89
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,389
eight y and then seven
y and then eight and then there will be

90
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
y and then eight and then there will be
 

91
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,030
y and then eight and then there will be
three four

92
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040

 

93
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,670

what yeah good question why so can you

94
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
what yeah good question why so can you
 

95
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,830
what yeah good question why so can you
tell me why

96
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
tell me why
 

97
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,710
tell me why
when you merge two trees right when we

98
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
when you merge two trees right when we
 

99
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,229
when you merge two trees right when we
merge to find the trees

100
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
merge to find the trees
 

101
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,589
merge to find the trees
how do we actually proceed uh

102
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
how do we actually proceed uh
 

103
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,470
how do we actually proceed uh
this bit looks like like that bit yeah

104
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
this bit looks like like that bit yeah
 

105
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,550
this bit looks like like that bit yeah
and that infinite if it is supposed to

106
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
and that infinite if it is supposed to
 

107
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,430
and that infinite if it is supposed to
have

108
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
have
 

109
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,949
have
all of it so easy

110
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
all of it so easy
 

111
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,150
all of it so easy
you have to even read this then you just

112
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
you have to even read this then you just
 

113
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,790
you have to even read this then you just
add them

114
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
add them
 

115
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,070
add them
up i think yeah good good point if this

116
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
up i think yeah good good point if this
 

117
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,270
up i think yeah good good point if this
both knows

118
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280

 

119
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,990

both notes have both trees have at least

120
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
both notes have both trees have at least
 

121
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,309
both notes have both trees have at least
no

122
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
no
 

123
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,470
no
the same position no you just add them

124
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
the same position no you just add them
 

125
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,589
the same position no you just add them
up right

126
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
up right
 

127
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,030
up right
look two plus six eight but look

128
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
look two plus six eight but look
 

129
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,509
look two plus six eight but look
six has a right like it at least two

130
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
six has a right like it at least two
 

131
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,630
six has a right like it at least two
does not have like it

132
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
does not have like it
 

133
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,390
does not have like it
so we just simply add it just

134
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
so we just simply add it just
 

135
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,390
so we just simply add it just
move it here yeah just copy over and

136
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
move it here yeah just copy over and
 

137
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,990
move it here yeah just copy over and
then look there's three

138
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
then look there's three
 

139
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,470
then look there's three
it doesn't have a right bit and if i put

140
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
it doesn't have a right bit and if i put
 

141
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,430
it doesn't have a right bit and if i put
another one like

142
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
another one like
 

143
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,350
another one like
five and then you need to change this to

144
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
five and then you need to change this to
 

145
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,710
five and then you need to change this to
one eight

146
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
one eight
 

147
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,070
one eight
yes look and then eight you have a left

148
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
yes look and then eight you have a left
 

149
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,350
yes look and then eight you have a left
child this does not have

150
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
child this does not have
 

151
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,830
child this does not have
a left trial let's let's just move it

152
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
a left trial let's let's just move it
 

153
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,390
a left trial let's let's just move it
over

154
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
over
 

155
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,350
over
so let's call how we merge to manages

156
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
so let's call how we merge to manages
 

157
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,869
so let's call how we merge to manages
okay

158
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
okay
 

159
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,149
okay
so how how can we do this thing uh

160
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159
so how how can we do this thing uh
 

161
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,910
so how how can we do this thing uh
how can we what's the so what's your

162
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
how can we what's the so what's your
 

163
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,430
how can we what's the so what's your
approach to

164
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
approach to
 

165
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,990
approach to
to merge to binary tree

166
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000

 

167
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,350

you just draw one over the other yeah so

168
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
you just draw one over the other yeah so
 

169
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,670
you just draw one over the other yeah so
it's

170
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
it's
 

171
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,710
it's
basically moving yeah

172
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
basically moving yeah
 

173
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,509
basically moving yeah
so then you just add them up

174
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
so then you just add them up
 

175
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,789
so then you just add them up
if they're both layer right define

176
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
if they're both layer right define
 

177
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,830
if they're both layer right define
merge and then two three is a and b

178
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
merge and then two three is a and b
 

179
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:10,430
merge and then two three is a and b
okay and what what am i missing

180
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:10,440

 

181
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,589

[Music]

182
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599

 

183
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,229

this returns the merge if a is num we

184
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
this returns the merge if a is num we
 

185
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,749
this returns the merge if a is num we
can return what

186
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
can return what
 

187
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,590
can return what
if a is now you can just return a

188
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
if a is now you can just return a
 

189
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,030
if a is now you can just return a
no if a tree a is yes yes good job

190
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
no if a tree a is yes yes good job
 

191
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,950
no if a tree a is yes yes good job
if a is long b

192
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:30,960

 

193
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,350

yeah so basically if one of them is long

194
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
yeah so basically if one of them is long
 

195
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,270
yeah so basically if one of them is long
we can return simply with another one

196
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
we can return simply with another one
 

197
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,870
we can return simply with another one
right because you when you merge the

198
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
right because you when you merge the
 

199
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,950
right because you when you merge the
final tree with something with the

200
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
final tree with something with the
 

201
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,830
final tree with something with the
binary tree

202
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
binary tree
 

203
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,790
binary tree
emerging with nothing and the result is

204
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
emerging with nothing and the result is
 

205
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,670
emerging with nothing and the result is
what

206
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680

 

207
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,390

the other one right yeah it doesn't make

208
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
the other one right yeah it doesn't make
 

209
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,110
the other one right yeah it doesn't make
sense that

210
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
sense that
 

211
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,230
sense that
if you merge

212
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
if you merge
 

213
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,909
if you merge
eric with nothing

214
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
eric with nothing
 

215
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,510
eric with nothing
is eric when you must ryan is nothing is

216
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
is eric when you must ryan is nothing is
 

217
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,350
is eric when you must ryan is nothing is
right yes

218
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360

 

219
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,469

zero yes yes exactly what is zero okay

220
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
zero yes yes exactly what is zero okay
 

221
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,950
zero yes yes exactly what is zero okay
so at this point can you tell me these

222
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
so at this point can you tell me these
 

223
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,830
so at this point can you tell me these
two a and b

224
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
two a and b
 

225
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,950
two a and b
are none or not

226
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
are none or not
 

227
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,670
are none or not
yeah look if a is noun it returns b if b

228
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
yeah look if a is noun it returns b if b
 

229
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,510
yeah look if a is noun it returns b if b
is not written a and at this point

230
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
is not written a and at this point
 

231
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,710
is not written a and at this point
both trees are nino and them are long

232
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
both trees are nino and them are long
 

233
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,590
both trees are nino and them are long
right

234
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
right
 

235
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,629
right
yeah so they are both noun

236
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
yeah so they are both noun
 

237
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,830
yeah so they are both noun
both the binary trees with the loop with

238
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
both the binary trees with the loop with
 

239
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,110
both the binary trees with the loop with
at least one note right

240
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
at least one note right
 

241
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,550
at least one note right
yeah okay so now what should we do

242
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
yeah okay so now what should we do
 

243
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,110
yeah okay so now what should we do
with if the both three one one of them

244
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
with if the both three one one of them
 

245
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,189
with if the both three one one of them
is one the other one is two so when they

246
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
is one the other one is two so when they
 

247
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,629
is one the other one is two so when they
merge it together we

248
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
merge it together we
 

249
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,990
merge it together we
you become three okay so

250
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,000
you become three okay so
 

251
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,150
you become three okay so
let's do let's do it let's create a new

252
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
let's do let's do it let's create a new
 

253
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,110
let's do let's do it let's create a new
note okay

254
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
note okay
 

255
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,550
note okay
let's let's do c okay c

256
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
let's let's do c okay c
 

257
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,990
let's let's do c okay c
equals three now three

258
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
equals three now three
 

259
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,430
equals three now three
notes okay and a stop

260
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
notes okay and a stop
 

261
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,110
notes okay and a stop
value b dot value

262
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
value b dot value
 

263
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,510
value b dot value
what should i put here

264
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
what should i put here
 

265
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,230
what should i put here
i create a new note add yes so this new

266
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
i create a new note add yes so this new
 

267
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,790
i create a new note add yes so this new
note

268
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
note
 

269
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,430
note
i'm creating contains the sum of both

270
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
i'm creating contains the sum of both
 

271
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,629
i'm creating contains the sum of both
notes yeah

272
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
notes yeah
 

273
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,790
notes yeah
right right so now look

274
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
right right so now look
 

275
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,070
right right so now look
so now i have these three these blue

276
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
so now i have these three these blue
 

277
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,629
so now i have these three these blue
trees

278
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
trees
 

279
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,469
trees
now i want to recursively merge i need

280
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
now i want to recursively merge i need
 

281
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,830
now i want to recursively merge i need
to be constantly merge

282
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:27,840
to be constantly merge
 

283
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,150
to be constantly merge
its left tree and the right tree on the

284
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
its left tree and the right tree on the
 

285
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,670
its left tree and the right tree on the
both sides right

286
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
both sides right
 

287
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,390
both sides right
yeah so let's look c dot left you tell

288
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
yeah so let's look c dot left you tell
 

289
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,029
yeah so let's look c dot left you tell
me what to do

290
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
me what to do
 

291
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,909
me what to do
let's use the left equals much much what

292
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919

 

293
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,029

okay so now this is the c and then this

294
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
okay so now this is the c and then this
 

295
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,629
okay so now this is the c and then this
left tree should be

296
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
left tree should be
 

297
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,990
left tree should be
mud to call this self um

298
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
mud to call this self um
 

299
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,270
mud to call this self um
recursion recursive function too much

300
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
recursion recursive function too much
 

301
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,629
recursion recursive function too much
value but the left tree of

302
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
value but the left tree of
 

303
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,950
value but the left tree of
these two right so this is a this is b

304
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
these two right so this is a this is b
 

305
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,309
these two right so this is a this is b
so what should i put here

306
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
so what should i put here
 

307
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,430
so what should i put here
a value a dot love tree

308
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
a value a dot love tree
 

309
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,950
a value a dot love tree
left g left b

310
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
left g left b
 

311
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,870
left g left b
and then b down right why are you left

312
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
and then b down right why are you left
 

313
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,430
and then b down right why are you left
left you're both birds in the left tree

314
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
left you're both birds in the left tree
 

315
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,309
left you're both birds in the left tree
the next one

316
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
the next one
 

317
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:27,860
the next one
is

i win okay so
if there are a notes in a3 and

330
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
if there are a notes in a3 and

337
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,150
okay or you can say o a plus b that's
right because that

338
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
right because that
 

339
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,350
right because that
because why is it because we need to

340
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
because why is it because we need to
 

341
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,589
because why is it because we need to
visit the number of nodes all the nodes

342
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
visit the number of nodes all the nodes
 

343
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,469
visit the number of nodes all the nodes
in three a

in three a
 

345
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,029
in three a
and then all the nodes in three b right

346
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
and then all the nodes in three b right

yeah
 

349
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,589
yeah
this is term complexity what is the

00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
this is term complexity what is the
 

351
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,870
this is term complexity what is the

o space complexity yeah
 

359
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,389
o space complexity yeah
space so what's the space and

360
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
space so what's the space and
 

361
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,910

right look if emerging means

00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
right look if emerging means

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,910
right look if emerging means
if if there are a tree with three notes

366
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920

plus a tree
 

369
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,670
plus a tree
i merge a tree with four notes and the

370
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
i merge a tree with four notes and the
 

371
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,030
i merge a tree with four notes and the
number of notes is

372
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
number of notes is
 

373
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,389
number of notes is
four in the final merged tree right

374
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
four in the final merged tree right
 

375
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,310

can you imagine is it true

376
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
can you imagine is it true
 

377
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,910
can you imagine is it true
yes yeah so let's we get a maximum of

378
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
yes yeah so let's we get a maximum of
 

379
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,269
yes yeah so let's we get a maximum of
both

both
 

381
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,710

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,710

n m sorry n m okay so it's the maximum

n m sorry n m okay so it's the maximum
 

385
