one you see so this this side if you go
 

61
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,510
one you see so this this side if you go
this side these are all ones yes

62
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
this side these are all ones yes
 

63
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,830
this side these are all ones yes
and these are our ones and now one plus

64
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
and these are our ones and now one plus
 

65
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,590
and these are our ones and now one plus
four

66
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
four
 

67
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,030
four
uh five you just get two three four five

68
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040

 

69
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:45,510

ten and

70
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520

 

71
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,830

okay so you know this pattern this is

72
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
okay so you know this pattern this is
 

73
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,389
okay so you know this pattern this is
called past container so what

74
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
called past container so what
 

75
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,310
called past container so what
do you notice why is it useful no

76
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
do you notice why is it useful no
 

77
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,510
do you notice why is it useful no
what one what's that eleven yeah

78
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
what one what's that eleven yeah
 

79
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,870
what one what's that eleven yeah
what's this one oh yeah it has eleven

80
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
what's this one oh yeah it has eleven
 

81
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,389
what's this one oh yeah it has eleven
times tables

82
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399

 

83
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,950

yeah and if you times it again that's

84
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
yeah and if you times it again that's
 

85
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,550
yeah and if you times it again that's
that's this number

86
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
that's this number
 

87
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,029
that's this number
yeah is it interesting yeah this is one

88
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
yeah is it interesting yeah this is one
 

89
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,070
yeah is it interesting yeah this is one
thing i don't

90
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
thing i don't
 

91
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,510
thing i don't
find how is eleven tables

92
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
find how is eleven tables
 

93
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,630
find how is eleven tables
one eleven to the power of zero is one

94
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
one eleven to the power of zero is one
 

95
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,550
one eleven to the power of zero is one
eleven to the power one is one eleven to

96
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
eleven to the power one is one eleven to
 

97
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,990
eleven to the power one is one eleven to
the power of 2 is

98
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
the power of 2 is
 

99
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,350
the power of 2 is
125. 11 times 3

100
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
125. 11 times 3
 

101
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,990
125. 11 times 3
11 times 11 times 11. so 121 times 11.

102
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000

 

103
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,030

uh look it's one three three one okay

104
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
uh look it's one three three one okay
 

105
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,070
uh look it's one three three one okay
yeah so 11 times 11 times 11 is one two

106
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
yeah so 11 times 11 times 11 is one two
 

107
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,550
yeah so 11 times 11 times 11 is one two
three one

108
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
three one
 

109
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,110
three one
even times eleven again then this is

110
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
even times eleven again then this is
 

111
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,710
even times eleven again then this is
this number every time is given again

112
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
this number every time is given again
 

113
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,750
this number every time is given again
okay

114
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
okay
 

115
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,910
okay
still get it and now nothing

116
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
still get it and now nothing
 

117
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,830
still get it and now nothing
and this thing has many many interesting

118
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
and this thing has many many interesting
 

119
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,270
and this thing has many many interesting
you know things like this

120
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
you know things like this
 

121
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,070
you know things like this
but another thing is that uh if you sum

122
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
but another thing is that uh if you sum
 

123
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,390
but another thing is that uh if you sum
up

124
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
up
 

125
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,390
up
this is one right yeah if you sum these

126
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
this is one right yeah if you sum these
 

127
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,190
this is one right yeah if you sum these
two right some digits

128
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200

 

129
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,990

you just keep doubling yeah if you sum

130
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
you just keep doubling yeah if you sum
 

131
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,750
you just keep doubling yeah if you sum
the digits

132
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
the digits
 

133
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,710
the digits
that's another thing yeah yeah okay so

134
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
that's another thing yeah yeah okay so
 

135

each number yeah yeah look
each number is the sum of its of its

150
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
each number is the sum of its of its
 

151
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,110
each number is the sum of its of its
shoulders yeah always shoulders so if we

152
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
shoulders yeah always shoulders so if we
 

153
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,990
shoulders yeah always shoulders so if we
tilt it this

154
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
tilt it this
 

155
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,750
tilt it this
if we tilt this triangle you have to

156
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
if we tilt this triangle you have to
 

157
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,430
if we tilt this triangle you have to
make it

158
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
make it
 

159
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,910
make it
make it the right triangle so what what

160
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
make it the right triangle so what what
 

161
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,350
make it the right triangle so what what
you will become

162
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
you will become
 

163
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,070

one one i write it this way right look
yeah so it's it's once so because what

170
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
yeah so it's it's once so because what
 

171
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,550
yeah so it's it's once so because what
we're doing is because this

172
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
we're doing is because this
 

173
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,990
we're doing is because this
is the uh the list in computers that we

174
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
is the uh the list in computers that we
 

175
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,949
is the uh the list in computers that we
have listed list

176
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
have listed list
 

177
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,070
have listed list
right all right yeah so it's easier to

178
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
right all right yeah so it's easier to
 

179
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,270
right all right yeah so it's easier to
to create a list for this

180
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
to create a list for this
 

181
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,150
to create a list for this
uh six four one okay so getting this

182
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
uh six four one okay so getting this
 

183
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,469
uh six four one okay so getting this
distance this kind of challenge

184
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
distance this kind of challenge
 

185
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,030
distance this kind of challenge
so we can do this we can do using this

186
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
so we can do this we can do using this
 

187
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,870
so we can do this we can do using this
let's do this define f

188
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
let's do this define f
 

189
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,030
let's do this define f
f eric and the first parameter let's

190
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
f eric and the first parameter let's
 

191
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,710
f eric and the first parameter let's
call let's call this number

192
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
call let's call this number
 

193
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,590
call let's call this number
uh row the row index and the column

194
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
uh row the row index and the column
 

195
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,189
uh row the row index and the column
index

196
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
index
 

197
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,350
index
okay so which row which index and it

198
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
okay so which row which index and it
 

199
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,909
okay so which row which index and it
returns the pascal integer

200
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
returns the pascal integer
 

201
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,070
returns the pascal integer
is the integer for that for the parts in

202
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
is the integer for that for the parts in
 

203
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,150
is the integer for that for the parts in
in the pascal triangle okay

204
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
in the pascal triangle okay
 

205
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,990
in the pascal triangle okay
all right look at this look at this

206
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
all right look at this look at this
 

207
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,430
all right look at this look at this
please

208
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
please
 

209
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,150
please
r and c for which row which c so if

210

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,070
or r equals c
if it's the if it's the the

220
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
if it's the if it's the the
 

221
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,110
if it's the if it's the the
one yeah once then we do turn one right

222
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
one yeah once then we do turn one right
 

223
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,310
one yeah once then we do turn one right
yes i'm right yeah

224
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
yes i'm right yeah
 

225
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,350
yes i'm right yeah
and add our last one all right so

226
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
and add our last one all right so
 

227
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,790
and add our last one all right so
what should we do no if

228
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
what should we do no if
 

229
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,909
what should we do no if
then we return return

230
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919

 

231
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,350

f we call itself right r minus one

232
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
f we call itself right r minus one
 

233
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,870
f we call itself right r minus one
c plus f r minus one

234
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
c plus f r minus one
 

235
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,430
c plus f r minus one
c minus one right that's it so this

236
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
c minus one right that's it so this
 

237
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,670
c minus one right that's it so this
returns the number

238
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
returns the number
 

239
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,990
returns the number
recursively returns the num the sum of

240
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
recursively returns the num the sum of
 

241
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,029
recursively returns the num the sum of
the of the two

242
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
the of the two
 

243
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,070
the of the two
integers right above it row

244
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
integers right above it row
 

245
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,390
integers right above it row
row that's always previous row yeah the

246
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
row that's always previous row yeah the
 

247
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,350
row that's always previous row yeah the
current column

248
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
current column
 

249
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,909
current column
and the previous column right so look

250
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
and the previous column right so look
 

251
00:05:49,919 --> 00:06:03,430
and the previous column right so look
remember

252
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440

 

253
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,350

look if r is if i is one zero one two

254
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,360
look if r is if i is one zero one two
 

255
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,710
look if r is if i is one zero one two
three

256
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
three
 

257
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,070
three
and c is zero one so three one it will

258
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
and c is zero one so three one it will
 

259
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,629
and c is zero one so three one it will
it will be it will be value of the sum

260
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
it will be it will be value of the sum
 

261
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,510
it will be it will be value of the sum
of

262
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
of
 

263
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,469
of
of this number plus this number yeah

264
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
of this number plus this number yeah
 

265
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,510
of this number plus this number yeah
this number is

266
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
this number is
 

267
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,790
this number is
r minus 1 c r minus 1 c minus 1 is this

268
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
r minus 1 c r minus 1 c minus 1 is this
 

269
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,749
r minus 1 c r minus 1 c minus 1 is this
number right

270
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
number right
 

271
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,230
number right
and in all in again you call this

272
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
and in all in again you call this
 

273
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,430
and in all in again you call this
recursive function

274
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
recursive function
 

275
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,909
recursive function
so if c is 0 you'll return 1. this

276
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
so if c is 0 you'll return 1. this
 

277
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:30,870
so if c is 0 you'll return 1. this
number will be

278
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
number will be
 

279
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,029
number will be
returned this number and this number so

280
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
returned this number and this number so
 

281
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,469
returned this number and this number so
these will be returning one

282
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
these will be returning one
 

283
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,510
these will be returning one
okay right so but look look this is

284
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
okay right so but look look this is
 

285
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,909
okay right so but look look this is
recursively function and every iteration

286
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
recursively function and every iteration
 

287
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,270
recursively function and every iteration
actually we are calling it multi

288
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
actually we are calling it multi
 

289
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,870
actually we are calling it multi
multiple times

290
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
multiple times
 

291
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,230
multiple times
i'm right yeah now we can actually

292
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
i'm right yeah now we can actually
 

293
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,430
i'm right yeah now we can actually
we can save this value so

294
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
we can save this value so
 

295
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,309
we can save this value so
how do we save it look for example if we

296
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
how do we save it look for example if we
 

297
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,309
how do we save it look for example if we
if we

298
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
if we
 

299
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,510
if we
look if we're calling this number yeah

300
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
look if we're calling this number yeah
 

301
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,189
look if we're calling this number yeah
we want to calculate this number

302
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
we want to calculate this number
 

303
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,710
we want to calculate this number
now we need to calculate this number and

304
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
now we need to calculate this number and
 

305
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,710
now we need to calculate this number and
this number right and then this number

306
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
this number right and then this number
 

307
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,350
this number right and then this number
this number

308
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
this number
 

309
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,670
this number
and this number but if i again i want to

310
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
and this number but if i again i want to
 

311
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,870
and this number but if i again i want to
take your least number

312
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
take your least number
 

313
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,710
take your least number
then these two numbers are already

314
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
then these two numbers are already
 

315
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,390
then these two numbers are already
calculated but we need to

316
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
calculated but we need to
 

317
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,430
calculated but we need to
do it again so we can save it because

318
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
do it again so we can save it because
 

319
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,270
do it again so we can save it because
because your function yeah

320
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
because your function yeah
 

321
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,110
because your function yeah
it's a recursive call so remember we use

322
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
it's a recursive call so remember we use
 

323
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,710
it's a recursive call so remember we use
the notebook right

324
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
the notebook right
 

325
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,589
the notebook right
but by using the notebook you you need

326
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
but by using the notebook you you need
 

327
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,749
but by using the notebook you you need
to modify the parameters and then if you

328
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
to modify the parameters and then if you
 

329
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,430
to modify the parameters and then if you
need to check if the

330
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
need to check if the
 

331
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,670
need to check if the
notebook has these numbers later

332
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
notebook has these numbers later
 

333
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,430
notebook has these numbers later
normally if it is by just returning

334
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
normally if it is by just returning
 

335
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,070
normally if it is by just returning
otherwise

336
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
otherwise
 

337
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,790
otherwise
i need to calculate this and save the

338
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
i need to calculate this and save the
 

339
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,430
i need to calculate this and save the
result in the

340
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
result in the
 

341
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,909
result in the
notebook there is another way to do it

342
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
notebook there is another way to do it
 

343
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,150
notebook there is another way to do it
which is faster you can do this

344
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
which is faster you can do this
 

345
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,950
which is faster you can do this
you you can just about a function you

346
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
you you can just about a function you
 

347
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,029
you you can just about a function you
just do this

348
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
just do this
 

349
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,550
just do this
add lru cash

350
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
add lru cash
 

351
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,029
add lru cash
cash we just put it max size equals num

352
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
cash we just put it max size equals num
 

353
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,990
cash we just put it max size equals num
okay so this is the this is to tell the

354
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
okay so this is the this is to tell the
 

355
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,150
okay so this is the this is to tell the
compiler that we are using a notebook

356
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
compiler that we are using a notebook
 

357
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,990
compiler that we are using a notebook
magic notebook and then you will you

358
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
magic notebook and then you will you
 

359
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,589
magic notebook and then you will you
will remember all of this

360
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
will remember all of this
 

361
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,510
will remember all of this
right okay i will show you with the

362
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
right okay i will show you with the
 

363
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,390
right okay i will show you with the
coding later another way of doing it

364
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
coding later another way of doing it
 

365
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,430
coding later another way of doing it
without uh look remember this

366
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
without uh look remember this
 

367
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,350
without uh look remember this
this this way yeah this way is i i want

368
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
this this way yeah this way is i i want
 

369
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,589
this this way yeah this way is i i want
to calculate this and i from a button up

370
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
to calculate this and i from a button up
 

371
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,189
to calculate this and i from a button up
so i need to get to the previous number

372
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
so i need to get to the previous number
 

373
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,110
so i need to get to the previous number
and you know this is from this direction

374
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
and you know this is from this direction
 

375
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,749
and you know this is from this direction
yeah

376
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
yeah
 

377
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,510
yeah
bottom up button up yeah

378
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
bottom up button up yeah
 

379
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,189
bottom up button up yeah
now we can do this the other way which

380
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
now we can do this the other way which
 

381
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,230
now we can do this the other way which
is top bottom top down

382
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
is top bottom top down
 

383
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,950
is top bottom top down
so top down so top down is that we

384
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
so top down so top down is that we
 

385
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,070
so top down so top down is that we
calculate from

386
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
calculate from
 

387
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,230
calculate from
phone look defined let's do a row by row

388
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
phone look defined let's do a row by row
 

389
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,750
phone look defined let's do a row by row
right rows

390
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
right rows
 

391
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,829
right rows
then columns and then we call we can say

392
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
then columns and then we call we can say
 

393
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,230
then columns and then we call we can say
the

394
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
the
 

395
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,990
the
data okay data equals now we set it to

396
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
data okay data equals now we set it to
 

397
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,750
data okay data equals now we set it to
zero

398
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
zero
 

399
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,110
zero
rows times rows

400
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
rows times rows
 

401
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,310
rows times rows
okay so now we have this row and then we

402
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
okay so now we have this row and then we
 

403
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,070
okay so now we have this row and then we
can do this for ah

404
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080

 

405
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,870

there are range rows

406
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880

 

407
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,630

yeah theta this no no the first one is

408
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
yeah theta this no no the first one is
 

409
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,470
yeah theta this no no the first one is
one right yeah

410
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
one right yeah
 

411
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,990
one right yeah
the last element which is which is what

412
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
the last element which is which is what
 

413
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,509
the last element which is which is what
ah

414
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
ah
 

415
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,190
ah
is also one right all right

416
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
is also one right all right
 

417
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,509
is also one right all right
and and then we need to for

418
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
and and then we need to for
 

419
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,870
and and then we need to for
c in range

420
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
c in range
 

421
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,550
c in range
ah

422
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560

 

423
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,990

actually we are going the other way we

424
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
actually we are going the other way we
 

425
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,630
actually we are going the other way we
need to calculate from the right to the

426
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
need to calculate from the right to the
 

427
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,110
need to calculate from the right to the
left so it should be wrenched range

428
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,120

 

429
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,190

r minus 1

430
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
r minus 1
 

431
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,949
r minus 1
0 minus 1 so start from r minus 1

432
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
0 minus 1 so start from r minus 1
 

433
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,949
0 minus 1 so start from r minus 1
till t 1 not including 0

434
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
till t 1 not including 0
 

435
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,509
till t 1 not including 0
every time decrement one and then we can

436
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
every time decrement one and then we can
 

437
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,389
every time decrement one and then we can
do this theta

438
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
do this theta
 

439
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,470
do this theta
c plus equals theta

440
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
c plus equals theta
 

441
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,430
c plus equals theta
c minus one and then we can print this

442
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
c minus one and then we can print this
 

443
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,430
c minus one and then we can print this
data

444
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
data
 

445
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,670
data
yes clearly

446
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
yes clearly
 

447
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,350
yes clearly
so we are we are this way we this way we

448
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
so we are we are this way we this way we
 

449
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,430
so we are we are this way we this way we
are constructing the row each row from

450
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
are constructing the row each row from
 

451
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,910
are constructing the row each row from
top

452
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
top
 

453
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,829
top
top to the down each row

454
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
top to the down each row
 

455
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,389
top to the down each row
yeah we're constructing this law which

456
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
yeah we're constructing this law which
 

457
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,670
yeah we're constructing this law which
is this data and

458
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
is this data and
 

459
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,710
is this data and
printed so look out will be

460
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
printed so look out will be
 

461
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,110
printed so look out will be
if i want to pass eight rows and then i

462
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
if i want to pass eight rows and then i
 

463
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,829
if i want to pass eight rows and then i
will be

464
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
will be
 

465
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,150
will be
printing a rows and each row at the

466
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
printing a rows and each row at the
 

467
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,310
printing a rows and each row at the
beginning i set these two

468
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
beginning i set these two
 

469
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,870
beginning i set these two
boundary of the triangle which is set to

470
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
boundary of the triangle which is set to
 

471
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,069
boundary of the triangle which is set to
one and then i

472
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
one and then i
 

473
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,509
one and then i
fill this the intermediate values

474
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:41,519
fill this the intermediate values
 

475
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,990
fill this the intermediate values
which is the sum of these previous

476
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
which is the sum of these previous
 

477
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,870
which is the sum of these previous
of the values above it and the one on

478
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
of the values above it and the one on
 

479
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,509
of the values above it and the one on
the left

480
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
the left
 

481
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,990
the left
right yeah yeah okay so let's do the

482
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
right yeah yeah okay so let's do the
 

483
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,910
right yeah yeah okay so let's do the
coding we can we can do it and we can

484
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
coding we can we can do it and we can
 

485
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,710
coding we can we can do it and we can
print it

486
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
print it
 

487
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:04,800
print it
so you should be fine okay

488
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:04,810

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,230
are you cash to make it faster okay
next time it was not okay let's let's do

570
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
next time it was not okay let's let's do
 

571
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,110
next time it was not okay let's let's do
this okay

572
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
this okay
 

573
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,190
this okay
four i in range let's put in the a

574
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
four i in range let's put in the a
 

575
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,230
four i in range let's put in the a
right for j

576
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
right for j
 

577
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,150
right for j
in range i right

578
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
in range i right
 

579
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,350
in range i right
then we put this current row i know

580
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:11,360
then we put this current row i know
 

581
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,990
then we put this current row i know
because this

582
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
because this
 

583
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,629
because this
is current uh row equals

584
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
is current uh row equals
 

585
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:26,389
is current uh row equals
a row yeah and

586
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399

and then we print cameron road

590
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
and then we print cameron road
 

591
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,750
and then we print cameron road
does it work let's see is this shaking a

592
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:37,760
does it work let's see is this shaking a
 

593
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,430
does it work let's see is this shaking a
little bit but that's okay

594
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440

 

595
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,790

you see does it oh no look the right

596
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:44,800
you see does it oh no look the right
 

597
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,910
you see does it oh no look the right
most number is not right so let's fix it

598
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920

 

599
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,430

we are not we need to arrange

600
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:55,440
we are not we need to arrange
 

601
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,030
we are not we need to arrange
range to it should be range uh

602
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040

 

603
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,310

i plus one right i'm

604
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
i plus one right i'm
 

605
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,069
i plus one right i'm
all right it'll be zero to

606
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
all right it'll be zero to
 

607
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,870
all right it'll be zero to
yes now it's it's working you see yeah

608
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
yes now it's it's working you see yeah
 

609
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,069
yes now it's it's working you see yeah
we're missing a number

610
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
we're missing a number
 

611
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,720
we're missing a number
at the uh in the previous version

612
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:17,730
at the uh in the previous version
 

613
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,189

does it make sense this one and then add

616
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
does it make sense this one and then add
 

617
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,230
does it make sense this one and then add
three and six okay so

618
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
three and six okay so
 

619
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,350
three and six okay so
so let's do another version okay

620
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360

 

621
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,470

let's do another version

622
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480

 

623
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,069

let's print another version okay so

624
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
let's print another version okay so
 

625
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,269
let's print another version okay so
let's say define pascal

626
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
let's say define pascal
 

627
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,590
let's say define pascal
rose we only print the row a number of

628
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
rose we only print the row a number of
 

629
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,870
rose we only print the row a number of
rows so let's say

630
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
rows so let's say
 

631
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,230
rows so let's say
theta equals let's set it to the rows

632
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240
theta equals let's set it to the rows
 

633
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,350
theta equals let's set it to the rows
okay so there are rows then four

634
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
okay so there are rows then four
 

635
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,760
okay so there are rows then four
are in

636
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:56,770
are in

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,230

uh let me let me check r minus one

644
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
uh let me let me check r minus one
 

645
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,509
uh let me let me check r minus one
zero minus one and then theta

646
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
zero minus one and then theta
 

647
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,389
zero minus one and then theta
c plus equals theta c minus

648
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
c plus equals theta c minus
 

649
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,990
c plus equals theta c minus

your point two uh oh there's a problem
 

659
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,110
your point two uh oh there's a problem
okay yeah not putting the data we need

660
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
okay yeah not putting the data we need
 

661
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,389
okay yeah not putting the data we need
to print

662
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
to print
 

663
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,389
to print
but look we have we don't need to put in

664
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
but look we have we don't need to put in
 

665
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,310
but look we have we don't need to put in
the zeros right we're not don't we're

666
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
the zeros right we're not don't we're
 

667
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,430
the zeros right we're not don't we're
not printing a zero so how can we fix it

668
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:55,440
not printing a zero so how can we fix it
 

669
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,430
not printing a zero so how can we fix it
because we're printing too much in line

670
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
because we're printing too much in line
 

671
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,870
because we're printing too much in line
24 we're printing too much

672
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
24 we're printing too much
 

673
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,150
24 we're printing too much
right so currently current row is

674
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
right so currently current row is
 

675
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,829
right so currently current row is
is only so we need to so print

676
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
is only so we need to so print
 

677
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,310
is only so we need to so print
um plus we only print the first r

678
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
um plus we only print the first r
 

679
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,550
um plus we only print the first r
element yes this is the slicing

680
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
element yes this is the slicing
 

681
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,550
element yes this is the slicing
always the array slicing complexity

682
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560

 

683
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,230

it's just oh uh let's call it oh and

684
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240
it's just oh uh let's call it oh and
 

685
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,110
it's just oh uh let's call it oh and
if there are are rows that will be all r

686
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
if there are are rows that will be all r
 

687
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,230
if there are are rows that will be all r
squared because

688
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
squared because
 

689
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,949
squared because
in each one yeah you're iterating r

690
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
in each one yeah you're iterating r
 

691
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,150
in each one yeah you're iterating r
times

692
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
times
 

693
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,870
times
and then for the rows and r for the

694
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
and then for the rows and r for the
 

695
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,509
and then for the rows and r for the
columns

696
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
columns
 

697
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,710
columns
so that will be r squared

698
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720

 

699
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,550

so uh um so is this does it make sense

700
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
so uh um so is this does it make sense
 

701
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,910
so uh um so is this does it make sense
this one

702
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
this one
 

703
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,670
this one
doesn't this make sense you want to have

704
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
doesn't this make sense you want to have
 

705
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,829
doesn't this make sense you want to have
a look at the code again

706
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
a look at the code again
 

707
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,350
a look at the code again
now so there are two version which one

708
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
now so there are two version which one
 

709
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,110
now so there are two version which one
is easier to understand also the first

710
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
is easier to understand also the first
 

711
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,509
is easier to understand also the first
one

712
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
one
 

713
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,069
one
you just calculate the numbers and the

714
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
you just calculate the numbers and the
 

715
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,030
you just calculate the numbers and the
triangle

716
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
triangle
 

717
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,110
triangle
and row r and column c right

718
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120
and row r and column c right
 

719
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,310
and row r and column c right
yes because in the row zero and z zero

720
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
yes because in the row zero and z zero
 

721
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,949
yes because in the row zero and z zero
all

722
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
all
 

723
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,550
all
r equals c is will return one otherwise

724
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,560
r equals c is will return one otherwise
 

725
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,110
r equals c is will return one otherwise
it's the sum of the previous row

726
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
it's the sum of the previous row
 

727
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,110
it's the sum of the previous row
with the with the number above it and

728
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
with the with the number above it and
 

729
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,710
with the with the number above it and
the one

730
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
the one
 

731
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,069
the one
uh on the left to it right right

732
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
uh on the left to it right right
 

733
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,429
uh on the left to it right right
yes for the pascal thing is you

734
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
yes for the pascal thing is you
 

735
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,069
yes for the pascal thing is you
just top down this is top down so you

736
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
just top down this is top down so you
 

737
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,590
just top down this is top down so you
start from the first row

738
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
start from the first row
 

739
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,549
start from the first row
and then you construct this ryan you're

740
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
and then you construct this ryan you're
 

741
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,069
and then you construct this ryan you're
blocking the views please

742
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
blocking the views please
 

743
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,390
blocking the views please
so you every time for every row you

744
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
so you every time for every row you
 

745
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,189
so you every time for every row you
check you

746
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
check you
 

747
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,990
check you
you set the first and the last element

748
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
you set the first and the last element
 

749
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,070
you set the first and the last element
which is one which is the boundary

750
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
which is one which is the boundary
 

751
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,310
which is one which is the boundary
the age of the triangle and then you

752
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
the age of the triangle and then you
 

753
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,270
the age of the triangle and then you
feel the in

754
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
feel the in
 

755
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,110
feel the in
the intermediate the middle numbers

756
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
the intermediate the middle numbers
 

757
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,549
the intermediate the middle numbers
which is the numbers

758
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
which is the numbers
 

759
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,909
which is the numbers
of the sum that of the two numbers

760
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
of the sum that of the two numbers
 

761
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,470
of the sum that of the two numbers
yeah in the previous one okay and then

762
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
yeah in the previous one okay and then
 

763
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,870
yeah in the previous one okay and then
you just need to print the

764
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
you just need to print the
 

765
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,750
you just need to print the
r numbers for the r rolls right because

766
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
r numbers for the r rolls right because
 

767
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,549
r numbers for the r rolls right because
you printed

768
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
you printed
 

769
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,590
you printed
the list of the data you print

770
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
the list of the data you print
 

771
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,190
the list of the data you print
everything including the yellow right

772
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,200
everything including the yellow right
 

773
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,230
everything including the yellow right
yes so this is the thing

774
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
yes so this is the thing
 

775
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,310
yes so this is the thing
so this is pascal triangle okay it's

776
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
so this is pascal triangle okay it's
 

777
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,510
so this is pascal triangle okay it's
very useful remember

778
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
very useful remember
 

779
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,990
very useful remember
what can we use it it's the 11th powers

780
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
what can we use it it's the 11th powers
 

781
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,110
what can we use it it's the 11th powers
table yeah

782
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
table yeah
 

783
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,510
table yeah
and it's the sum of the digits in each

784
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
and it's the sum of the digits in each
 

785
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,950
and it's the sum of the digits in each
row of the triangle

786
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
row of the triangle
 

787
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,070
row of the triangle
is the in in two times table or two

788
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
is the in in two times table or two
 

789
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,950
is the in in two times table or two
powers yes

790
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
powers yes
 

791
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,789
powers yes
two four eight okay uh

792
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
two four eight okay uh
 

793
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,789
two four eight okay uh
interesting and then we will come back

794
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:20,799
interesting and then we will come back
 

795
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,950
interesting and then we will come back
to the in the next time

796
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:22,960
to the in the next time
 

797
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,590
to the in the next time
when we talk about the interesting

798
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
when we talk about the interesting
 

799
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,430
when we talk about the interesting
properties of this pascal triangle we

800
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
properties of this pascal triangle we
 

801
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:27,990
properties of this pascal triangle we
can use it

802
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
can use it
 

803
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,710
can use it
as a to calculate some more complex

804
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
as a to calculate some more complex
 

805
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,870
as a to calculate some more complex
problems like the combination

806
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:32,880
problems like the combination
 

807
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,150
problems like the combination
something like how many ways you pick

808
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,160
something like how many ways you pick
 

809
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,350
something like how many ways you pick
like uh two apples out of three

810
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
like uh two apples out of three
 

811
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,870
like uh two apples out of three
yeah if there are three apples different

812
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
yeah if there are three apples different
 

813
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,190
yeah if there are three apples different
apples and you want to pick two of it

814
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
apples and you want to pick two of it
 

815
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,420
apples and you want to pick two of it
how many ways can you do it

816
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:47,430

 

817
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,750

[Music]
 

819
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,230
[Music]
i can show you one is four

820
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
i can show you one is four
 

821
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,190
i can show you one is four
no two no keep guessing

822
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200

 

823
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,350

why is it eleven what's the question

824
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
why is it eleven what's the question
 

825
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,070
why is it eleven what's the question
how many how many ways if you pick two

826
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
how many how many ways if you pick two
 

827
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,430
how many how many ways if you pick two
apples out of three

828
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
apples out of three
 

829
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,470
apples out of three
how many ways to do pick two apples if

830
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
how many ways to do pick two apples if
 

831
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,909
how many ways to do pick two apples if
there are three apples and then you want

832
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
there are three apples and then you want
 

833
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,510
there are three apples and then you want
to pick two apples how many ways are
