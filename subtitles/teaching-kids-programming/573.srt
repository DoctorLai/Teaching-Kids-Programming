1
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:16,260
something language structure something

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,960
language what's cute anybody where queen

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,100
queen

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,279
structure query the language okay

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,199
clearing structure clear language

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,359
we know we learned this before right

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,480
yeah

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,480
it is

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,680
language

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,059
or somebody prefer extend the query

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,140
language you can think of it as a

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,480
programming language there's a scripting

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,640
language that allow us to interact with

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,480
database so let's say we have a table

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,719
what's Taylor

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,760
how to explain okay that's fine so the

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,559
table is a thing that has four loads and

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,719
you put food on it and eat and sometimes

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,940
you work with the emperor flowers at the

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,399
right and the table cover that's good

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,520
explanation for another table okay table

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,519
in database my database database can

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,060
consist of one or more tables right day

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,340
tables are the container that we put the

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,820
data let's say name right we have a name

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,820
and we have a score okay this is just

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,220
the column head

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,560
okay so now here is the data from here

29
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,360
is the data so we can say Eric

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,799
score 100.

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,280
and then

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,820
Ryan score of a thousand okay okay and

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,820
then Mommy

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:39,659
500 okay 500 that's it okay so this is

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,240
the table the third is called okay I

36
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,520
don't I don't mind okay okay so look

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,759
apart from the first

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,840
first row this is the metadata this is

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,759
we specify the name of the columns right

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,299
the name of the column so this column

41
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,799
the name the First Column the name the

42
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,479
second column the score which is the

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,799
integer the First Column is a string

44
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,439
right and then we have a four records in

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,899
this table make sense this is uh how we

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,800
store the data in an organized way in a

47
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,879
database so if we want to get the

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,520
highest score

49
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,680
high is the distance go so we can say

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,379
select

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,140
Max right Max this is a function Max

52
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,180
score

53
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,640
here right from

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,319
if this is the table name right for each

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,260
table we give them let's say this table

56
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,300
we call it

57
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,300
data okay data database

58
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:45,180
score from data and then it will return

59
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,400
return a thousand that's it yeah okay so

60
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,420
another way of doing is that select

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,920
score from data all the

62
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,120
by

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,000
score we're going to solve a score in

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,180
descending order by before is ascended

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,239
indecent in order but we want to return

66
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,120
the first record so we can say limit

67
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,840
one that's it how about if we want to

68
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,080
get the second highest score

69
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,120
which is 500 okay look remember they are

70
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,519
a thousand they are twice what I mean

71
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,379
the second highest this thing what's

72
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,640
this thing this thing is another word

73
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:27,180
for unique

74
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,900
okay so you want to return the second

75
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:34,200
highest distance score record which is

76
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:38,959
500 how would you write it any idea

77
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,959
I mean forget about the SQL so

78
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,080
but you need me to you will return a

79
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,879
thousand a thousand it's not 500. in

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,420
this table how would you know 500 is the

81
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,420
second highest

82
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,620
okay let me give you

83
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,860
highest okay with this information how

84
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,019
do you get 500.

85
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,540
so I already tell you a thousand this is

86
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,220
the highest score in this table so I

87
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,599
want you to find out 500 how would you

88
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:16,859
do that you do the thing there yeah yeah

89
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:19,739
but ignore a thousand we're done ignore

90
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,780
a thousand okay so that's it so

91
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,759
you know I already tell you how to get

92
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,220
the highs right which is a thousand

93
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,160
right and then you can do this again but

94
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,199
on filter out a thousand because I said

95
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,199
this thing okay this thing a thousand a

96
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,199
thousand could have multiple requests

97
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,199
Mexico

98
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,979
Max score wrong and we don't need to

99
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,979
solve okay

100
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,800
look let me do the highest right select

101
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,540
Max

102
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,580
score

103
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,100
from

104
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,680
beta this is the highest one right this

105
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,040
is the highest right I just have to do

106
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,600
this again look I I do this like select

107
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,400
select Max I want to do the max again

108
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,259
Max score okay

109
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,880
from

110
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,979
data

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,040
but I want to add one more criteria

112
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,960
which is where

113
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,380
the data

114
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,479
well it's not in not in here and that's

115
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,460
it this B is a thousand right we just

116
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,460
get it this is a sub query sub query

117
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,840
this is a thousand no I'm doing this

118
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,560
again select Max score from data where

119
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,120
data not in a thousand right if it's not

120
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,539
in Thousand you can say not in Thousand

121
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,840
or not equal right or you can say

122
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:51,720
smaller than right smaller 20 30 you

123
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,539
know 300 400 right so what does it do

124
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,160
look where first of all you will get

125
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,500
this you will run this sub query which

126
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,759
retains a thousand right we know this is

127
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,419
a thousand

128
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,419
and then

129
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,620
where could it right you would run

130
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,340
through the tables and

131
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:14,160
filter out those records which is we

132
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,900
where data is not in or smaller than

133
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,060
that smaller than a thousand right

134
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,039
smaller and a thousand four hundred is

135
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,900
more than seven twenty is smaller than

136
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,880
thousand so your handle is smaller than

137
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,400
a thousand but a thousand is not smaller

138
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,880
than a thousand okay so this is the use

139
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,880
case that we have a SQL with the sub

140
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,100
query and to get the second highest this

141
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,039
thing highest okay another way when I

142
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,860
select Celeste score

143
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,680
from

144
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,660
data order we need to sort it right

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,199
order by

146
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,199
score

147
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,660
then

148
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,500
limit

149
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:58,440
one offset we want to skip

150
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,240
two if I we have to this thing we don't

151
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,400
put the distance because we could have

152
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,380
multiple a thousand

153
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,800
we could have multiple thousand and we

154
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:11,100
want to only return the unique

155
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,000
okay this is another way to to get it

156
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:17,520
okay so if there is only a thousand and

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,740
if there is only one record right and it

158
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,099
doesn't have a second highest then this

159
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,500
will return nothing so how do we do it

160
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:28,020
we can use the function if none

161
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:33,000
so we can say select

162
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:37,080
if none this is a software all right new

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,900
okay so this thing will be will be this

164
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,060
one yeah go here right so if this thing

165
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,979
if the parameter this is basically this

166
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,840
is a function I if the first parameter

167
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:49,139
is new then we return the second

168
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,419
parameter okay yeah actually offset one

169
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:53,520
okay because the offset style is a zero

170
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,440
offset one limit one so it's a second

171
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,199
another thing I want to mention is the

172
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,900
silver Max we can have a extra as

173
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,479
something as a title new title new title

174
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:07,020
for the column as eighth so you will

175
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,599
return us a table instead of Mexico you

176
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,660
would have this eight a thousand okay

177
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,759
okay so what have you learned today we

178
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,400
have learned about how how do you find

179
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:21,060
the second distinct how you struggled in

180
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:24,740
as a table in a table okay so how would

181
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,660
you do it you just didn't get rid of the

182
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,280
find the maps and get rid of it and then

183
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,919
find the max again

184
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,719
final Mexican yes okay so we use the

185
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,820
South Korea this is a sub query right

186
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,940
before we only talk about that's

187
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,700
something from somewhere right select

188
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:46,080
something from somewhere where

189
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:47,640
conditions right order by something

190
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,980
limit

191
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,459
one limit one this is basically the

192
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,980
number of Records written offset one

193
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,480
limit right they mean a number this is

194
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,180
the number of record we want to return

195
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,620
offset is basically saying that skipping

196
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,959
the first

197
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,700
field record okay yeah

198
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,440
yeah offset one means that we want to

199
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,959
skip the first record which is the

200
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,320
second highest okay this thing this

201
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,320
thing means

202
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,560
so how many ways we can do it

203
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:27,540
so one way is

204
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:30,660
we find the highest we and then to find

205
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,360
the second highest they ignore that

206
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:37,740
the highest and then we just

207
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,480
kind of high end yeah yeah

208
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,220
the second way the key thing is they're

209
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,620
too soft

210
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,380
the first way is to ignore this is

211
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,720
software the second way is to sort to

212
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,880
order I have to sort it so based on this

213
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,940
which one is more efficient for a little

214
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,800
much and then important

215
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,500
you're shorter but the first one is

216
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,480
better better yes this is the same thing

217
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,580
as Echo right we have a number right a

218
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,339
thousand a thousand

219
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,839
five hundred twenty Thirty we want to

220
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,560
find the second highest how would you do

221
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,740
it

222
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:14,600
how would you do it

223
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,600
yeah how is it doing uh in Accra

224
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,180
well if this is a array okay

225
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,080
a

226
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:37,380
the second highest is minus 2y if a is

227
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,899
more than two elements okay obviously if

228
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,660
there is only one distinct

229
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:45,360
then that's going to be a problem right

230
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,880
because look look a does salt and we

231
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,500
need to actually need to make it a set

232
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,540
first right so we need to first of all

233
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,540
we need to accept a

234
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,700
set contains the unique number set a and

235
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,940
then we can assorted and return the

236
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,300
second what's the time from next day

237
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:06,240
oh and Logan yeah

238
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:08,940
this one remember the max so and so once

239
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,700
okay a thousand is the maximum yeah

240
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,040
second round we just also and ignore a

241
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,320
thousand okay 500 is the maximum the max

242
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,680
is the time direction is 11. which one

243
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,680
is better

244
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,680
and I said okay you want to find a

245
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,140
thousand I don't need to solve it until

246
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,540
right I think just go okay this is a

247
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,820
thousand current Max color Max

248
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,860
color Max is a thousand a thousand a

249
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,180
thousand okay because these are not

250
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,779
bigger than the southern does it make

251
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,339
sense yes that's it for today bye bye

252
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:50,480
bye

253
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,480
fight ing
