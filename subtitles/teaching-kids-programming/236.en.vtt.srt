00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,150
good so remember yesterday we talked
about the bricks problem we have quick

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,160
about the bricks problem we have quick
 

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,230
about the bricks problem we have quick
layout right remember

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,240
layout right remember
 

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,390
layout right remember
bricks they are so what what's the

10
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
bricks they are so what what's the
 

11
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,310
bricks they are so what what's the
problem can you remind me or

12
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:18,320
problem can you remind me or
 

13
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,630
problem can you remind me or
i mean so we have a look okay that's it

14
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
i mean so we have a look okay that's it
 

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,230
i mean so we have a look okay that's it
we have a wall yeah and then each wall

16
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
we have a wall yeah and then each wall
 

17
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,230
we have a wall yeah and then each wall
is okay i need a

18
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
is okay i need a
 

19
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,229
is okay i need a
plan a better pen so each more

20
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
plan a better pen so each more
 

21
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,590
plan a better pen so each more
for example like the brick the bricks

22
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
for example like the brick the bricks
 

23
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,950
for example like the brick the bricks
are height of one unit

24
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
are height of one unit
 

25
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,549
are height of one unit
okay so that's height so that's one two

26
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
okay so that's height so that's one two
 

27
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:43,190
okay so that's height so that's one two
three four

28
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
three four
 

29
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,310
three four
five h equals five and a width

30
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
five h equals five and a width
 

31
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,790
five h equals five and a width
yeah with let's say equals five as well

32
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
yeah with let's say equals five as well
 

33
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,270
yeah with let's say equals five as well
and then we have two kinds of bricks

34
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280
and then we have two kinds of bricks
 

35
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,709
and then we have two kinds of bricks
two and three okay three and two okay

36
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
two and three okay three and two okay
 

37
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,270
two and three okay three and two okay
three and two and you can only place the

38
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
three and two and you can only place the
 

39
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,150
three and two and you can only place the
bricks

40
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
bricks
 

41
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,830
bricks
horizontally yeah one by one

42
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
horizontally yeah one by one
 

43
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,349
horizontally yeah one by one
horizontally

44
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:01,359
horizontally
 

45
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,229
horizontally
so how many ways of placing the five

46
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
so how many ways of placing the five
 

47
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,910
so how many ways of placing the five
yeah because five equals three plus two

48
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
yeah because five equals three plus two
 

49
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,789
yeah because five equals three plus two
or two plus three

50
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
or two plus three
 

51
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,990
or two plus three
it's a it's a uh you can pick as many

52
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
it's a it's a uh you can pick as many
 

53
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,149
it's a it's a uh you can pick as many
each break you can you can place as many

54
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
each break you can you can place as many
 

55
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,670
each break you can you can place as many
as you want so there are unlimited

56
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
as you want so there are unlimited
 

57
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,670
as you want so there are unlimited
number of each place okay so this is

58
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
number of each place okay so this is
 

59
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,310
number of each place okay so this is
kind of the

60
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
kind of the
 

61
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,030
kind of the
unbounded network problem yeah enough

62
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
unbounded network problem yeah enough
 

63
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,990
unbounded network problem yeah enough
set

64
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
set
 

65
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,910
set
so what does it mean is that you are you

66
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
so what does it mean is that you are you
 

67
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,950
so what does it mean is that you are you
want to this snapsec is the capacity is

68
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
want to this snapsec is the capacity is
 

69
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,149
want to this snapsec is the capacity is
w

70
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
w
 

71
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,710
w
right and now we have these different

72
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
right and now we have these different
 

73
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,429
right and now we have these different
items

74
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
items
 

75
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,830
items
each item for example this item is size

76
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
each item for example this item is size
 

77
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,630
each item for example this item is size
of three

78
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
of three
 

79
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,030
of three
which item is size of two and we want to

80
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
which item is size of two and we want to
 

81
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,350
which item is size of two and we want to
fulfill the left set with these two

82
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
fulfill the left set with these two
 

83
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,429
fulfill the left set with these two
two kinds item by for each item there

84
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
two kinds item by for each item there
 

85
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,789
two kinds item by for each item there
are unlimited number of

86
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
are unlimited number of
 

87
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,710
are unlimited number of
of these uh you can choose anonymity

88
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
of these uh you can choose anonymity
 

89
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,990
of these uh you can choose anonymity
right so

90
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
right so
 

91
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,030
right so
this is two okay so two ways three plus

92
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
this is two okay so two ways three plus
 

93
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,630
this is two okay so two ways three plus
two or two plus three

94
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
two or two plus three
 

95
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,950
two or two plus three
so this is two way and how many times

96
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
so this is two way and how many times
 

97
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,310
so this is two way and how many times
how many possibilities

98
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
how many possibilities
 

99
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,429
how many possibilities
we can place in the second row how many

100
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
we can place in the second row how many
 

101
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,030
we can place in the second row how many
possibilities

102
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
possibilities
 

103
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,550
possibilities
the first one is two and the second one

104
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
the first one is two and the second one
 

105
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,950
the first one is two and the second one
is how many

106
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
is how many
 

107
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,310
is how many
the same yeah is it the same

108
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
the same yeah is it the same
 

109
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,550
the same yeah is it the same
ryan yeah okay so the third one

110
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
ryan yeah okay so the third one
 

111
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,309
ryan yeah okay so the third one
yeah how how do you come up with this

112
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
yeah how how do you come up with this
 

113
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,150
yeah how how do you come up with this
number

114
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
number
 

115
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,589
number
say i times two

116
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
say i times two
 

117
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,430
say i times two
times two times two times two times two

118
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
times two times two times two times two
 

119
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,190
times two times two times two times two
so two to the power five right

120
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
so two to the power five right
 

121
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,710
so two to the power five right
because each the number of ways to place

122
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
because each the number of ways to place
 

123
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,110
because each the number of ways to place
the first row second row three third row

124
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
the first row second row three third row
 

125
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,869
the first row second row three third row
is independent they are independent

126
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
is independent they are independent
 

127
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,350
is independent they are independent
right

128
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
right
 

129
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,190
right
so the combination yeah the combination

130
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
so the combination yeah the combination
 

131
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,350
so the combination yeah the combination
is multiplied so two to the power five

132
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
is multiplied so two to the power five
 

133
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,710
is multiplied so two to the power five
okay

134
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
okay
 

135
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,390
okay
so yesterday we talked about the top

136
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
so yesterday we talked about the top
 

137
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,790
so yesterday we talked about the top
down so if we

138
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
down so if we
 

139
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,390
down so if we
if we use the f

140
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
if we use the f
 

141
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,750
if we use the f
f with okay as we to

142
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
f with okay as we to
 

143
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,110
f with okay as we to
to to represent a number of ways to

144
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
to to represent a number of ways to
 

145
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,830
to to represent a number of ways to
put the bricks yeah put the bricks in

146
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
put the bricks yeah put the bricks in
 

147
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,270
put the bricks yeah put the bricks in
the size w

148
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
the size w
 

149
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,070
the size w
so do you still remember it's equals to

150
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
so do you still remember it's equals to
 

151
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,790
so do you still remember it's equals to
what

152
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
what
 

153
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,830
what
it equals to the sum of

154
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
it equals to the sum of
 

155
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,350
it equals to the sum of
f or w minus i

156
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
f or w minus i
 

157
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,589
f or w minus i
where i belongs yeah remember this

158
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
where i belongs yeah remember this
 

159
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,190
where i belongs yeah remember this
symbol belongs

160
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
symbol belongs
 

161
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,350
symbol belongs
belongs to it looks like this ear

162
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
belongs to it looks like this ear
 

163
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,750
belongs to it looks like this ear
belongs to the bricks yeah

164
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
belongs to the bricks yeah
 

165
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,190
belongs to the bricks yeah
okay and f

166
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
okay and f
 

167
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,390

169
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,229
f let's say f uh let's say
f k is smaller e is zero

170
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
f k is smaller e is zero
 

171
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,149
f k is smaller e is zero
if k is smaller than zero yeah and f k

172
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
if k is smaller than zero yeah and f k
 

173
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,509
if k is smaller than zero yeah and f k
is one if

174
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
is one if
 

175
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,830
is one if
okay we can just say f zero equals one

176
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
okay we can just say f zero equals one
 

177
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,869
okay we can just say f zero equals one
okay

178
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
okay
 

179
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,309
okay
okay okay okay so now

180
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
okay okay okay so now
 

181
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,229
okay okay okay so now
so yesterday we talked about this the

182
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
so yesterday we talked about this the
 

183
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,149
so yesterday we talked about this the
recursion with the minimization we use

184
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
recursion with the minimization we use
 

185
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,670
recursion with the minimization we use
the cache remember yeah

186
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
the cache remember yeah
 

187
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,910
the cache remember yeah
and then we can do this in minimize

188
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
and then we can do this in minimize
 

189
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,030
and then we can do this in minimize
recursion to

190
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
recursion to
 

191
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,149
recursion to
to solve in order to to solve f w we

192
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
to solve in order to to solve f w we
 

193
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,110
to solve in order to to solve f w we
need to

194
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
need to
 

195
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,550
need to
calculate recursively fw f function with

196
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
calculate recursively fw f function with
 

197
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,750
calculate recursively fw f function with
the smaller

198
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
the smaller
 

199
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,030
the smaller
value right so this is top down okay so

200
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
value right so this is top down okay so
 

201
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,429
value right so this is top down okay so
let's do it button up we can use it we

202
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
let's do it button up we can use it we
 

203
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,030
let's do it button up we can use it we
can we can use the

204
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
can we can use the
 

205
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,110
can we can use the
we can use another approach to implement

206
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
we can use another approach to implement
 

207
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,869
we can use another approach to implement
these to solve this dynamic programming

208
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
these to solve this dynamic programming
 

209
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,910
these to solve this dynamic programming
algorithm right

210
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
algorithm right
 

211
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,550
algorithm right
so right defined let's say this is cloud

212
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
so right defined let's say this is cloud
 

213
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,390
so right defined let's say this is cloud
function and we have the number of

214
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
function and we have the number of
 

215
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,589
function and we have the number of
bricks

216
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
bricks
 

217
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,630
bricks
and we have a w we have h

218
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
and we have a w we have h
 

219
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,310
and we have a w we have h
right all right right look so now if we

220
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
right all right right look so now if we
 

221
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,069
right all right right look so now if we
want to define another function define

222
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
want to define another function define
 

223
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,950
want to define another function define
f f1

224
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960

 

225
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,070

let's say fn okay yeah

226
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
let's say fn okay yeah
 

227
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,270
let's say fn okay yeah
dp this is array we want to start

228
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
dp this is array we want to start
 

229
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,310
dp this is array we want to start
store this number uh this number the

230
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
store this number uh this number the
 

231
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,230
store this number uh this number the
first one dp 0 is what

232
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
first one dp 0 is what
 

233
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,510
first one dp 0 is what
remember is equal to one plus z return

234
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
remember is equal to one plus z return
 

235
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,710
remember is equal to one plus z return
zen yeah the first one is dbz

236
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
zen yeah the first one is dbz
 

237
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,110
zen yeah the first one is dbz
plus zero zero times n what does it mean

238
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
plus zero zero times n what does it mean
 

239
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,749
plus zero zero times n what does it mean
what does it mean what does it mean here

240
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:51,759
what does it mean what does it mean here
 

241
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,150
what does it mean what does it mean here
so this is

242
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
so this is
 

243
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,749
so this is
is equal to one plus zero

244
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
is equal to one plus zero
 

245
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,670
is equal to one plus zero
times your with your yeah so this is

246
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
times your with your yeah so this is
 

247
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,909
times your with your yeah so this is
this will come up with the array which

248
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
this will come up with the array which
 

249
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,590
this will come up with the array which
is one and then zero

250
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
is one and then zero
 

251
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,029
is one and then zero
zero zero how many zeros here how many

252
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
zero zero how many zeros here how many
 

253
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,230
zero zero how many zeros here how many
others yeah how many yellow yeah come on

254
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
others yeah how many yellow yeah come on
 

255
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,189
others yeah how many yellow yeah come on
and and then that's one yeah pp1 okay so

256
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
and and then that's one yeah pp1 okay so
 

257
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,189
and and then that's one yeah pp1 okay so
that's what it means tp is this array i

258
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
that's what it means tp is this array i
 

259
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,189
that's what it means tp is this array i
know we want to calculate this tp array

260
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
know we want to calculate this tp array
 

261
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,870
know we want to calculate this tp array
from from t this is 0 fdb 0 is this

262
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
from from t this is 0 fdb 0 is this
 

263
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,350
from from t this is 0 fdb 0 is this
value

264
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
value
 

265
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,110
value
and we want to calculate these one by

266
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
and we want to calculate these one by
 

267
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,110
and we want to calculate these one by
one tier dpn right

268
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
one tier dpn right
 

269
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,029
one tier dpn right
ppn so that result is dpn right right

270
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
ppn so that result is dpn right right
 

271
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,909
ppn so that result is dpn right right
and we can also use which number dpn is

272
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
and we can also use which number dpn is
 

273
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,790
and we can also use which number dpn is
dp1

274
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
dp1
 

275
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,870
dp1
the last number of the array which is we

276
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
the last number of the array which is we
 

277
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,790
the last number of the array which is we
usually use a negative number which is

278
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
usually use a negative number which is
 

279
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,390
usually use a negative number which is
what

280
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
what
 

281
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,590
what
minus one minus one well so so this is

282
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
minus one minus one well so so this is
 

283
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,270
minus one minus one well so so this is
the bottom up why is whatever

284
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
the bottom up why is whatever
 

285
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,430
the bottom up why is whatever
look we're calculating the tp from a

286
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
look we're calculating the tp from a
 

287
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,110
look we're calculating the tp from a
smaller number to the upper number the

288
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
smaller number to the upper number the
 

289
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,550
smaller number to the upper number the
top down what's that

290
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
top down what's that
 

291
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,150
top down what's that
top down we want to calculate the dpm

292
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
top down we want to calculate the dpm
 

293
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,830
top down we want to calculate the dpm
but we we then we

294
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
but we we then we
 

295
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,270
but we we then we
need to go back to the lower to the dpu

296
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
need to go back to the lower to the dpu
 

297
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,790
need to go back to the lower to the dpu
with a smaller value yeah

298
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
with a smaller value yeah
 

299
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,909
with a smaller value yeah
so that's what it means so now dp then i

300
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
so that's what it means so now dp then i
 

301
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,830
so that's what it means so now dp then i
can do this

302
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840
can do this
 

303
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,909
can do this
for i in

304
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
for i in
 

305
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,550
for i in
range n plus one and plus one yeah

306
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
range n plus one and plus one yeah
 

307
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,110
range n plus one and plus one yeah
because we

308
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
because we
 

309
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,830
because we
they this is up to n okay and then we

310
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
they this is up to n okay and then we
 

311
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,590
they this is up to n okay and then we
want to go through the bricks

312
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
want to go through the bricks
 

313
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,790
want to go through the bricks
what's fj in what

314
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
what's fj in what
 

315
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,710
what's fj in what
in bricks yeah we only go through the

316
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
in bricks yeah we only go through the
 

317
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,110
in bricks yeah we only go through the
bricks but we want to make sure that the

318
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
bricks but we want to make sure that the
 

319
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,990
bricks but we want to make sure that the
the capacity is bigger than the bricks

320
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
the capacity is bigger than the bricks
 

321
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,110
the capacity is bigger than the bricks
yeah so we need to

322
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
yeah so we need to
 

323
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,189
yeah so we need to
check if what if

324
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
check if what if
 

325
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,070
check if what if
i become

326
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080

 

327
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,909

okay and then we need to sum up with

328
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
okay and then we need to sum up with
 

329
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,070
okay and then we need to sum up with
that finger dp

330
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
that finger dp
 

331
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,510
that finger dp
i plus equals what d

332
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
i plus equals what d
 

333
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,110
i plus equals what d
p i minus j yeah i might say remember

334
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
p i minus j yeah i might say remember
 

335
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,150
p i minus j yeah i might say remember
remember this

336
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,160
remember this
 

337
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,830
remember this
this uh f n equals f

338
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
this uh f n equals f
 

339
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,110
this uh f n equals f
equals sum of f n minus i where i is the

340
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
equals sum of f n minus i where i is the
 

341
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,350
equals sum of f n minus i where i is the
bricks yeah it's the bricks

342
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
bricks yeah it's the bricks
 

343
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,110
bricks yeah it's the bricks
okay so that's what it means and then we

344
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
okay so that's what it means and then we
 

345
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,070
okay so that's what it means and then we
turn

346
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080

 

347
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,150

minus one all dpy or dp1 db minus one or

348
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
minus one all dpy or dp1 db minus one or
 

349
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,309
minus one all dpy or dp1 db minus one or
tp1

350
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319

 

351
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,510

time time height

352
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520

 

353
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,749

dp minus one is the last element which

354
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
dp minus one is the last element which
 

355
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,110
dp minus one is the last element which
is what dpy

356
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
is what dpy
 

357
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,749
is what dpy
remember we just talked about db1 and

358
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
remember we just talked about db1 and
 

359
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,430
remember we just talked about db1 and
it's the same yeah

360
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
it's the same yeah
 

361
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,469
it's the same yeah
yeah this is the same too and then we we

362
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
yeah this is the same too and then we we
 

363
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,309
yeah this is the same too and then we we
know that fn so we turn

364
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
know that fn so we turn
 

365
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,670
know that fn so we turn
to return f and with time time

366
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
to return f and with time time
 

367
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,950
to return f and with time time
yeah f width is the times time high

368
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
yeah f width is the times time high
 

369
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,909
yeah f width is the times time high
remember f

370
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
remember f
 

371
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,950
remember f
is f5 is two right yeah times time

372
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
is f5 is two right yeah times time
 

373
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,550
is f5 is two right yeah times time
what's time time height

374
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
what's time time height
 

375
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,070
what's time time height
mean the power okay two times

376
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
mean the power okay two times
 

377
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,270
mean the power okay two times
times three equals one

378
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
times three equals one
 

379
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,230
times three equals one
two eight eight because two two times

380
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
two eight eight because two two times
 

381
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,469
two eight eight because two two times
two times two three twos times together

382
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479
two times two three twos times together
 

383
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,029
two times two three twos times together
and you can also write it as power power

384
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
and you can also write it as power power
 

385
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,469
and you can also write it as power power
two two three two comma three okay it's

386
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:58,479
two two three two comma three okay it's
 

387
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,909
two two three two comma three okay it's
the same thing two to the power of three

388
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
the same thing two to the power of three
 

389
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,670
the same thing two to the power of three
that's two to the power six so it's it's

390
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
that's two to the power six so it's it's
 

391
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,029
that's two to the power six so it's it's
two to the power of three what's the

392
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
two to the power of three what's the
 

393
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,869
two to the power of three what's the
time complexity

394
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
time complexity
 

395
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,150
time complexity
i i a w h

396
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
i i a w h
 

397
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,070
i i a w h
w h well then look this is this is n

398
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
w h well then look this is this is n
 

399
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,790
w h well then look this is this is n
yeah w

400
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
yeah w
 

401
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,510
yeah w
yeah we're calling that w actually this

402
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
yeah we're calling that w actually this
 

403
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,029
yeah we're calling that w actually this
is w

404
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
is w

h h h f w
 

407
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,909
h h h f w
and then h actually this is this is the

408
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
and then h actually this is this is the
 

409
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,749
and then h actually this is this is the
side

410
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
side
 

411
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,070
side
actually not w h because

412
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080

 

413
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,190

uh not w h w n

414
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
uh not w h w n
 

415
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,750
uh not w h w n
n is the number of bricks okay so it's

416
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
n is the number of bricks okay so it's
 

417
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,630
n is the number of bricks okay so it's
all wn

418
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
all wn
 

419
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,310
all wn
okay times h let's call it uh

420
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
okay times h let's call it uh
 

421
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,589
okay times h let's call it uh
okay 2 to the power of power function

422
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
okay 2 to the power of power function
 

423
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,750
okay 2 to the power of power function
okay 2 to the power of

424
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
okay 2 to the power of
 

425
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,870
okay 2 to the power of
let's say x to the power of y x to the

426
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
let's say x to the power of y x to the
 

427
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,509
let's say x to the power of y x to the
power y

428
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
power y
 

429
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,110
power y
the complexity is log y okay

430
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
the complexity is log y okay
 

431
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,550
the complexity is log y okay
so actually the complexity would be o w

432
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
so actually the complexity would be o w
 

433
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,750
so actually the complexity would be o w
times m times log height

434
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
times m times log height
 

435
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,470
times m times log height
okay so that's the complexity n is the

436
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
okay so that's the complexity n is the
 

437
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,670
okay so that's the complexity n is the
number of bricks

438
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
number of bricks
 

439
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,670
number of bricks
yeah w this is w and

440
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
yeah w this is w and
 

441
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,710
yeah w this is w and
and because at last we need to times

442
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
and because at last we need to times
 

443
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,509
and because at last we need to times
with the

444
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
with the
 

445
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,389
with the
h which is the height and if we want to

446
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
h which is the height and if we want to
 

447
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,110
h which is the height and if we want to
consider

448
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
consider
 

449
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,990
consider
x to the power of y compute that these

450
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
x to the power of y compute that these
 

451
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,430
x to the power of y compute that these
the compound velocity will be

452
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
the compound velocity will be
 

453
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,190
the compound velocity will be
o h here oh log h why is that

454
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
o h here oh log h why is that
 

455
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,949
o h here oh log h why is that

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,230
four is eight times two is six
so so what what does it mean two to the

498
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
so so what what does it mean two to the
 

499
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,430
so so what what does it mean two to the
power of three times two

500
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
power of three times two
 

501
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,190
power of three times two
so how many times i'm doing that total

502
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
so how many times i'm doing that total
 

503
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,030
so how many times i'm doing that total
house three you know only times two

504
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
house three you know only times two
 

505
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,990
house three you know only times two
times

506
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
times
 

507
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,470
times
yeah so you you can get these two times

508
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
yeah so you you can get these two times
 

509
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,269
yeah so you you can get these two times
and then

510
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
and then
 

511
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,550
and then
times itself times itself

512
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
times itself times itself
 

513
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,470
times itself times itself
sixteen so how many how many

514
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
sixteen so how many how many
 

515
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,069
sixteen so how many how many
multiplication are you talking about

516
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
multiplication are you talking about
 

517
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,069
multiplication are you talking about
look if you do this six times you get

518
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
look if you do this six times you get
 

519
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:32,630
look if you do this six times you get
one two

520
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
one two
 

521
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,710
one two
three four five five times okay you

522
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
three four five five times okay you
 

523
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,069
three four five five times okay you
times it five times

524
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
times it five times
 

525
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,990
times it five times
but here you only times it how many

526
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
but here you only times it how many
 

527
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,990
but here you only times it how many
times four uh three times

528
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
times four uh three times
 

529
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,190
times four uh three times
because i can kick you like this this is

530
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
because i can kick you like this this is
 

531
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,790
because i can kick you like this this is
two times yeah

532
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
two times yeah
 

533
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,790
two times yeah
two multiplication two times two times

534
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
two multiplication two times two times
 

535
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,829
two multiplication two times two times
two right

536
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
two right
 

537
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,829
two right
yeah that's eight and eight times eight

538
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
yeah that's eight and eight times eight
 

539
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,910
yeah that's eight and eight times eight
so that's one two three three times so

540
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
so that's one two three three times so
 

541
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,670
so that's one two three three times so
which one is better

542
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
which one is better
 

543
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,150
which one is better
which one is better this one yeah

544
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
which one is better this one yeah
 

545
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,310
which one is better this one yeah
because it uses less multiplication

546
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
because it uses less multiplication
 

547
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,430
because it uses less multiplication
that's what i mean yes

548
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
that's what i mean yes
 

549
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,470
that's what i mean yes
if if a to the power of b if b

550
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
if if a to the power of b if b
 

551
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,150
if if a to the power of b if b
is an even number if b is even number i

552
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
is an even number if b is even number i
 

553
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,269
is an even number if b is even number i
can always do this

554
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
can always do this
 

555
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,710
can always do this
a to the power of b 2 and then i do this

556
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
a to the power of b 2 and then i do this
 

557
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,030
a to the power of b 2 and then i do this
right look right if b is even number

558
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
right look right if b is even number
 

559
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,310
right look right if b is even number
i can do this because this uses less

560
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
i can do this because this uses less
 

561
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,110
i can do this because this uses less
inter multiplication and i can save half

562
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
inter multiplication and i can save half
 

563
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,430
inter multiplication and i can save half
if

564
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
if
 

565
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,230
if
b is odd number so if b is all number

566
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
b is odd number so if b is all number
 

567
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,190
b is odd number so if b is all number
equals a

568
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
equals a
 

569
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,470
equals a
times a times e minus one right

570
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
times a times e minus one right
 

571
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,670
times a times e minus one right
look yeah because look there be b with a

572
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
look yeah because look there be b with a
 

573
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,829
look yeah because look there be b with a
a uh two to the power of three equals

574
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
a uh two to the power of three equals
 

575
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,069
a uh two to the power of three equals
one two times two to the power of two

576
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
one two times two to the power of two
 

577
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,150
one two times two to the power of two
that's it because the three times of

578
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
that's it because the three times of
 

579
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,230
that's it because the three times of
three twos times together equals

580
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
three twos times together equals
 

581
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,069
three twos times together equals
one two times two twos right okay so

582
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
one two times two twos right okay so
 

583
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,949
one two times two twos right okay so
what uh here a to the power of b we want

584
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
what uh here a to the power of b we want
 

585
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,670
what uh here a to the power of b we want
to calculate

586
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
to calculate
 

587
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,389
to calculate
the time complexity is not b okay okay

588
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
the time complexity is not b okay okay
 

589
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,110
the time complexity is not b okay okay
okay

590
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
okay
 

591
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,629
okay
yeah okay that's it for today thank you

592
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
yeah okay that's it for today thank you
 

593
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,720
yeah okay that's it for today thank you
bye bye bye we're done good job
