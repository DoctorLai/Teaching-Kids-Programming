1
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,950

so today we will talk about how to count

2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
so today we will talk about how to count
 

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,910
so today we will talk about how to count
the number of nodes in a binary stream

4
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:21,920
the number of nodes in a binary stream
 

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,150
the number of nodes in a binary stream
remember what's the binary tree

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160

 

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,390

is a tree basically the left one

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
is a tree basically the left one
 

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,430
is a tree basically the left one
should be bigger than two no that one is

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
should be bigger than two no that one is
 

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,470
should be bigger than two no that one is
should be smaller than the white one

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
should be smaller than the white one
 

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,389
should be smaller than the white one
now let's finally search what i'm

14
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
now let's finally search what i'm
 

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,069
now let's finally search what i'm
talking about is talking about is the

16
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
talking about is talking about is the
 

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,670
talking about is talking about is the
binary tree

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
binary tree
 

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,590
binary tree
okay so just just anybody on the street

20
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
okay so just just anybody on the street
 

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,709
okay so just just anybody on the street
okay so

22
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
okay so
 

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,389
okay so
how many notes are there five five yeah

24
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
how many notes are there five five yeah
 

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,350
how many notes are there five five yeah
yeah so you as human we can see there

26
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
yeah so you as human we can see there
 

27
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,029
yeah so you as human we can see there
are five yeah yeah but

28
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
are five yeah yeah but
 

29
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,110
are five yeah yeah but
how about a lot and then it's not easy

30
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
how about a lot and then it's not easy
 

31
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,150
how about a lot and then it's not easy
to count

32
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
to count
 

33
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,990
to count
at the beginning and we want to let the

34
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
at the beginning and we want to let the
 

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,590
at the beginning and we want to let the
computer to count okay

36
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
computer to count okay
 

37
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,830
computer to count okay
so today we're going to solve this okay

38
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840

 

39
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,270

okay so let's do this right right

40
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280

 

41
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,469

so we have the winner so let's look at

42
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
so we have the winner so let's look at
 

43
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,270
so we have the winner so let's look at
this note here so let's say if i have

44
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
this note here so let's say if i have
 

45
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,550
this note here so let's say if i have
many many

46
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
many many
 

47
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,950
many many
notes okay it's too hard to count okay

48
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
notes okay it's too hard to count okay
 

49
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,469
notes okay it's too hard to count okay
like that okay so let's explain

50
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
like that okay so let's explain
 

51
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,230
like that okay so let's explain
i know i know you're not counting okay

52
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
i know i know you're not counting okay
 

53
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,350
i know i know you're not counting okay
so how much how do we count it

54
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
so how much how do we count it
 

55
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,950
so how much how do we count it
how do you count ten how do you count it

56
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
how do you count ten how do you count it
 

57
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,230
how do you count ten how do you count it
three three four you become

58
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
three three four you become
 

59
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,230
three three four you become
three three four okay and how do you

60
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
three three four okay and how do you
 

61
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,910
three three four okay and how do you
count it orion

62
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920

 

63
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,069

three three four how do i

64
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
three three four how do i
 

65
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,190
three three four how do i
know that is three dollars one

66
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
know that is three dollars one
 

67
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,830
know that is three dollars one
two three so there are two ways of

68
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
two three so there are two ways of
 

69
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,789
two three so there are two ways of
cutting yes seven eight

70
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799

 

71
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,990

so you can cut it this way okay so you

72
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
so you can cut it this way okay so you
 

73
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,389
so you can cut it this way okay so you
first of all you can count

74
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
first of all you can count
 

75
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,229
first of all you can count
you can i'm the ruler here yeah okay

76
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
you can i'm the ruler here yeah okay
 

77
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,469
you can i'm the ruler here yeah okay
so first of all i know there's one one

78
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
so first of all i know there's one one
 

79
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,350
so first of all i know there's one one
note yeah

80
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
note yeah
 

81
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,949
note yeah
so it is root one plus the left three

82
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959
so it is root one plus the left three
 

83
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,990
so it is root one plus the left three
okay the note of the left tree

84
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
okay the note of the left tree
 

85
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,229
okay the note of the left tree
yeah and plus the note of the right tree

86
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:20,239
yeah and plus the note of the right tree
 

87
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,869
yeah and plus the note of the right tree
okay five yeah

88
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
okay five yeah
 

89
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,309
okay five yeah
all right so in this case the left tree

90
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
all right so in this case the left tree
 

91
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,790
all right so in this case the left tree
and again it's in one note plus the left

92
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
and again it's in one note plus the left
 

93
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,110
and again it's in one note plus the left
and the right don't get it

94
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
and the right don't get it
 

95
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,150
and the right don't get it
yeah it's gonna take away no but the

96
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
yeah it's gonna take away no but the
 

97
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,390
yeah it's gonna take away no but the
computer is very fast

98
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
computer is very fast
 

99
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,010
computer is very fast
computer is very fast yeah the other way

100
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,020
computer is very fast yeah the other way

104
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
so this is called the default search
 

105
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,949
so this is called the default search
yeah that first you remember we talked

106
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
yeah that first you remember we talked
 

107
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,309
yeah that first you remember we talked
about this both uh

108
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
about this both uh
 

109
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,509
about this both uh
the different traversal agreement we

110
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
the different traversal agreement we
 

111
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,750
the different traversal agreement we
remember preorder post order immediate

112
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
remember preorder post order immediate
 

113
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,869
remember preorder post order immediate
in order yeah

114
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
in order yeah
 

115
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,869
in order yeah
yeah the difference search so so it

116
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
yeah the difference search so so it
 

117
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,110
yeah the difference search so so it
means that when you cut it because

118
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,120
means that when you cut it because
 

119
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,309
means that when you cut it because
yeah we could call the left turn the

120
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
yeah we could call the left turn the
 

121
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,350
yeah we could call the left turn the
right and then we

122
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
right and then we
 

123
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,509
right and then we
we add one meter okay yeah and then

124
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
we add one meter okay yeah and then
 

125
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,030
we add one meter okay yeah and then
press for 30 as you said but first

126
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
press for 30 as you said but first
 

127
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,869
press for 30 as you said but first
search is level by level okay so

128
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
search is level by level okay so
 

129
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,430
search is level by level okay so
how many notes it means number one yeah

130
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
how many notes it means number one yeah
 

131
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,710
how many notes it means number one yeah
and then there are two

132
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
and then there are two
 

133
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,910
and then there are two
and then two and then three one

134
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
and then two and then three one
 

135
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,589
and then two and then three one
one okay so that's another way of

136
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
one okay so that's another way of
 

137
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,020

00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919

 

171
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,230

enough yeah let's call that first

172
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
enough yeah let's call that first
 

173
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,590
enough yeah let's call that first
recursion therefore

174
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
recursion therefore
 

175
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,629
recursion therefore
look if we are wait for me

176
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
look if we are wait for me
 

177
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,189
look if we are wait for me
if the load is numb then we return zero

178
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
if the load is numb then we return zero
 

179
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,070
if the load is numb then we return zero
otherwise

180
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
otherwise
 

181
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,670
otherwise
there's one node of current and then we

182
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
there's one node of current and then we
 

183
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,510
there's one node of current and then we
don't know how many nodes in the left

184
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
don't know how many nodes in the left
 

185
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,230
don't know how many nodes in the left
right

186
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
right
 

187
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,230
right
let's call it recursively so let's call

188
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
let's call it recursively so let's call
 

189
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,670
let's call it recursively so let's call
this function

190
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
this function
 

191
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,870
this function
to call it again then this will solve

192
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
to call it again then this will solve
 

193
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,710
to call it again then this will solve
the smaller problem the left three

194
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
the smaller problem the left three
 

195
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,950
the smaller problem the left three
and then like that right three and then

196
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
and then like that right three and then
 

197
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,230
and then like that right three and then
yeah if last three

198
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
yeah if last three
 

199
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,710
yeah if last three
three left uh the three notes in the

200
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
three left uh the three notes in the
 

201
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,230
three left uh the three notes in the
left three and four notes in the right

202
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
left three and four notes in the right
 

203
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,230
left three and four notes in the right
tree and then total would be eight

204
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
tree and then total would be eight
 

205
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,749
tree and then total would be eight
because there's one more yeah

206
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
because there's one more yeah
 

207
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,670
because there's one more yeah
three four and one yeah you see this is

208
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
three four and one yeah you see this is
 

209
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,350
three four and one yeah you see this is
very clear yeah

210
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
very clear yeah
 

211
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,629
very clear yeah
okay yeah

212
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
okay yeah
 

213
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,150
okay yeah
okay now let's move to the uh second one

214
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
okay now let's move to the uh second one
 

215
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,909
okay now let's move to the uh second one
which is called the breakfast search

216
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
which is called the breakfast search
 

217
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:34,629
which is called the breakfast search
break first okay okay you're

218
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639

 

219
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,629

okay so first of all we also need this

220
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
okay so first of all we also need this
 

221
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,830
okay so first of all we also need this
yeah we also need these

222
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
yeah we also need these
 

223
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,909
yeah we also need these
yeah if it's nothing okay i'm not going

224
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
yeah if it's nothing okay i'm not going
 

225
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,830
yeah if it's nothing okay i'm not going
to copy it okay if you lose it's nothing

226
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
to copy it okay if you lose it's nothing
 

227
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,629
to copy it okay if you lose it's nothing
that will be 10

228
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
that will be 10
 

229
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,990
that will be 10
00 okay yes yes okay then now

230
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
00 okay yes yes okay then now
 

231
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,670
00 okay yes yes okay then now
remember the preferences will use the

232
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
remember the preferences will use the
 

233
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,590
remember the preferences will use the
cube i'm just

234
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
cube i'm just
 

235
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,870
cube i'm just
writing this oh again yeah no no

236
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
writing this oh again yeah no no
 

237
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,350
writing this oh again yeah no no
no no look this is simple and you tell

238
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
no no look this is simple and you tell
 

239
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,590
no no look this is simple and you tell
me you tell me which one is easy which

240
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
me you tell me which one is easy which
 

241
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,390
me you tell me which one is easy which
ones

242
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
ones
 

243
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,710
ones
which one is better okay what's the

244
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
which one is better okay what's the
 

245
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,950
which one is better okay what's the
complexity of this one

246
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960

 

247
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,070

there are a number of notes in and and

248
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
there are a number of notes in and and
 

249
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,710
there are a number of notes in and and
no

250
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
no
 

251
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,430
no
yes why why is the one because you have

252
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
yes why why is the one because you have
 

253
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,150
yes why why is the one because you have
to check

254
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
to check
 

255
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,469
to check
every note yeah yeah because we have to

256
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
every note yeah yeah because we have to
 

257
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,230
every note yeah yeah because we have to
visit every note to count it yeah

258
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
visit every note to count it yeah
 

259
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,830
visit every note to count it yeah
yeah we cut one yeah very good so look

260
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
yeah we cut one yeah very good so look
 

261
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,590
yeah we cut one yeah very good so look
up account another load

262
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
up account another load
 

263
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,189
up account another load
then we use a queue yeah q first row has

264
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
then we use a queue yeah q first row has
 

265
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,830
then we use a queue yeah q first row has
a load

266
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
a load
 

267
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,309
a load
in the list okay this is our uh

268
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
in the list okay this is our uh
 

269
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,029
in the list okay this is our uh
yeah so now why the length of the q

270
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
yeah so now why the length of the q
 

271
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,110
yeah so now why the length of the q
is bigger than zero when there's some

272
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
is bigger than zero when there's some
 

273
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,070
is bigger than zero when there's some
element in the q

274
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
element in the q
 

275
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,189
element in the q
then i also have a answer answer equals

276
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
then i also have a answer answer equals
 

277
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,629
then i also have a answer answer equals
zero we called it okay

278
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
zero we called it okay
 

279
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,749
zero we called it okay
so now look uh we

280
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
so now look uh we
 

281
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,150
so now look uh we
we need to pop it so p equals

282
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
we need to pop it so p equals
 

283
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,070
we need to pop it so p equals
q dot pot zlo remember this is to remove

284
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
q dot pot zlo remember this is to remove
 

285
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,350
q dot pot zlo remember this is to remove
the element from here yeah yes

286
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
the element from here yeah yes
 

287
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,710
the element from here yeah yes
and then we have remove one now so we

288
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
and then we have remove one now so we
 

289
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,230
and then we have remove one now so we
have to count it

290
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
have to count it
 

291
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,189
have to count it
yeah increment counters of another one

292
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
yeah increment counters of another one
 

293
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,029
yeah increment counters of another one
answer

294
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
answer
 

295
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,150
answer
plus equal

296
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,160
plus equal
 

297
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,110
plus equal
equals one we have removed one number so

298
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
equals one we have removed one number so
 

299
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,189
equals one we have removed one number so
what is

300
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199

 

301
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,589

we have removed the node from the queue

302
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
we have removed the node from the queue
 

303
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,390
we have removed the node from the queue
then

304
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
then
 

305
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,350
then
we know one more note yeah yeah so what

306
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
we know one more note yeah yeah so what
 

307
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,830
we know one more note yeah yeah so what
should we do

308
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840

 

309
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,170

okay

310
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:31,180
okay
 

311
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:38,280
okay
[Music]

left yeah if p dot left is not num

316
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
left yeah if p dot left is not num
 

317
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,909
left yeah if p dot left is not num
right then we do this q dot

318
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
right then we do this q dot
 

319
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,830
right then we do this q dot
append append

320
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
append append
 

321
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,430
append append
p dot left okay and then similarly if p

322
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
p dot left okay and then similarly if p

if the note has the left right that
 

327
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,309
if the note has the left right that
would push it to the q if it has one

328
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
would push it to the q if it has one

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,909
kill the append
he's alright is there anything missing

338
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
he's alright is there anything missing
 

339
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,270
he's alright is there anything missing
here return

340
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
here return
 

341
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,309
here return
return

342
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319

 

343
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:33,829

because

344
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839

 

345
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,149

we check if the current node has if it

346
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
we check if the current node has if it
 

347
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,430
we check if the current node has if it
has the left triad

348
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
has the left triad
 

349
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,269
has the left triad
then we'll push it to the kill i never

350
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
then we'll push it to the kill i never
 

351
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,790
then we'll push it to the kill i never
push the right half to a kill

352
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
push the right half to a kill
 

353
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,670
push the right half to a kill
right so in this case this equilibrium

354
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
right so in this case this equilibrium
 

355
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,949
right so in this case this equilibrium
will visit the node

356
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
will visit the node
 

357
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,430
will visit the node
like this is one two three four the

358
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
like this is one two three four the
 

359
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,070
like this is one two three four the
sequence

360
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
sequence
 

361
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,310
sequence
of the node visiting removing will be

362
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
of the node visiting removing will be
 

363
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,990
of the node visiting removing will be
one

364
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
one
 

365
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,230
one
two and what's next

366
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240

 

367
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,509

three three four five yes three four

368
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
three three four five yes three four
 

369
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,590
three three four five yes three four
five level by level remember never buy

370
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
five level by level remember never buy
 

371
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,870
five level by level remember never buy
levels

372
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
levels
 

373
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,710
levels
yeah what's the time complexity of this

374
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
yeah what's the time complexity of this
 

375
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,150
yeah what's the time complexity of this
one

376
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
one
 

377
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,110
one
what's the term complexity the red one

378
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
what's the term complexity the red one
 

379
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,720
what's the term complexity the red one
yeah

380
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:12,730

 

381
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,070

[Music]

382
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
[Music]
 

383
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,870
[Music]
is it the same do we have the visit on

384
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
is it the same do we have the visit on
 

385
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,550
is it the same do we have the visit on
each node

386
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
each node
 

387
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,430
each node
yes oh yeah yes we have to visit each

388
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
yes oh yeah yes we have to visit each
 

389
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,829
yes oh yeah yes we have to visit each
now

390
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
now
 

391
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,670
now
right no matter which way you pick it's

392
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
right no matter which way you pick it's
 

393
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,110
right no matter which way you pick it's
the same yeah

394
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
the same yeah
 

395
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,350
the same yeah
it's just different for this one you

396
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
it's just different for this one you
 

397
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,430
it's just different for this one you
meet the sequences

398
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
meet the sequences
 

399
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,870
meet the sequences
one two

400
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
one two
 

401
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,070
one two
four five three but for this is one two

402
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
four five three but for this is one two
 

403
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,630
four five three but for this is one two
three four

404
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
three four
 

405
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,110
three four
five you see even they are different but

406
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
five you see even they are different but
 

407
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,790
five you see even they are different but
they are the counter is all they

408
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
they are the counter is all they
 

409
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,990
they are the counter is all they
all get we all get five notes using both

410
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
all get we all get five notes using both
 

411
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,509
all get we all get five notes using both
okay using each of them okay do get it

412
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
okay using each of them okay do get it
 

413
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,070
okay using each of them okay do get it
okay so this is called the default

414
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
okay so this is called the default
 

415
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,829
okay so this is called the default
search recursion within people using

416
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839
search recursion within people using
 

417
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,150
search recursion within people using
because

418
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
because
 

419
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,269
because
so which one do you like whatever it is

420
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
so which one do you like whatever it is
 

421
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,470
so which one do you like whatever it is
which one do you think is easier quicker

422
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
which one do you think is easier quicker
 

423
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,990
which one do you think is easier quicker
that's what

424
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000

 

425
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,750

so that's the breakfast search okay

426
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
so that's the breakfast search okay
 

427
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,190
so that's the breakfast search okay
let's look at the first one but did he

428
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
let's look at the first one but did he
 

429
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,670
let's look at the first one but did he
say

430
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
say
 

431
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,269
say
it he likes this one because it's

432
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
it he likes this one because it's
 

433
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,910
it he likes this one because it's
shorter right shorter to to implement

434
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
shorter right shorter to to implement
 

435
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,710
shorter right shorter to to implement
okay

436
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
okay
 

437
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,030
okay
okay thank you very much okay say bye
