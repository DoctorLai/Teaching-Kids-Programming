1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,000
hello hello mystery are you right yeah

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,360
okay so today we're given an array of

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
numbers real numbers

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,720
but we have uh even number of numbers in

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,119
this array so let's say 2 minus 1 3 4

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,439
minus 2 minus 3

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,359
so this is there are six numbers even

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,080
numbers even number of numbers and now

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,680
we have equal number of positive and

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,920
negative numbers so

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,439
so to put this involved we have n

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,640
positive number

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,360
and n

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,239
negative number okay

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,360
and we want to discuss is that

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,520
to a rearranging array such that

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,520
the positive and negative numbers are

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,360
interleaving so one positive one

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,200
negative one positive one negative any

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,800
sound is the positive

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,680
and also okay so the order of original

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,120
numbers are maintained for the positive

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,600
and negative so

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,280
here so we can rearrange the numbers

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,199
such as look

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,799
2 minus 1

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,320
3

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,119
and -2

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,439
4

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,600
minus 3 okay look

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,760
the order of the positive number is two

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,439
three four and then the new array will

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,280
be two three four the order of the

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,759
negative numbers minus one minus two

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,479
minus three and the order of mu the the

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,640
negative number in the origin in the new

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,240
array is minus one minus two minus eight

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,439
okay and they start with the positive

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,920
number and the each consecutive numbers

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,799
are different signs look two

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,840
plus minus plus minus plus minus

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,960
yeah

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,960
you are interested with

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,280
how do we do it

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,280
okay the question how do we do it

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,960
what's your in your mind how we

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,600
rearrange this

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,399
so if there are two kinds of numbers so

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,640
ideally what can we do a lobby without

50
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,880
it um so i

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,360
what can i do with it

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,000
so i just

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,479
find the first positive yeah first

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,479
positive

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,000
okay so let's say we have an array of

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,000
the same size but let's fill it with

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,160
zero at the beginning okay it doesn't

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,400
matter or any number it doesn't matter

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,920
so there are two four six numbers

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
okay so now

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,280
i give you a hint

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,800
if i say i have a pointer

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,959
which is the

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,879
positive i have another pointer which is

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,680
negative because the positive always

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,959
comes first so this is the

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,920
pointer p is the index value the points

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,480
to the

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,120
next positive number we are going to

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,760
put right this is not negative

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,200
okay so how how we have two pointers

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,319
yeah

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,319
yeah yeah

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,280
so i have i go through these numbers in

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,080
here two this is positive

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,080
so what should we do

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,319
so this is two so what happened what

78
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,159
should we do with the p

79
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,440
and we should

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,040
put it two

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,040
and two two spaces

82
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,500
[Music]

83
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,799
yeah and then and then and then you move

84
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,799
and two faces

85
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,959
and then we point

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,760
p equals p plus two four

87
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,120
yeah so we put it four and then it goes

88
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,280
out of scope but it doesn't matter

89
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
because we don't have any more positive

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,000
numbers minus two

91
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,000
yeah

92
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,560
let's see okay

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,439
yeah

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,680
what's the time complexity

95
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,319
and i need the number of elements what's

96
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,080
the space complexity

97
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,400
and yeah

98
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,799
we need this additional array to store

99
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,319
the numbers we can't modify the original

100
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,319
can we multiply directly here

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,519
not really yeah

102
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,240
because what why is it because look we

103
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,560
if we modify here then we need we

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,199
we lost the values in the future we

105
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,880
might go because we only we iterate the

106
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,520
number from the left to the right but

107
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,240
but the p the pointer may go faster

108
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,400
right

109
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
because it moves two space and then if

110
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,840
we move to space we need to change the

111
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,320
value here then we might lose the

112
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,479
original value yeah

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,479
make sense

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,520
okay so let's let's try this

115
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,759
define rearrange

116
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,919
and then let's land us

117
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,040
okay so let let's say

118
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,479
p is

119
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,800
the first element the index the pointer

120
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,320
the negative is the one the start from

121
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,880
the second element

122
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,840
and now we need this answer which is the

123
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,199
and

124
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,880
copy yeah

125
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,840
a copy of the numbers rearranged yeah

126
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,080
so let's say we can copy it from nums

127
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,639
we can we can use this syntax

128
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,639
to copy or we can use this

129
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,639
copy dot d copy

130
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
to make a deep copy

131
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,670
big copy is the column yeah clone

132
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,000
everything copy including the contents

133
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,400
[Music]

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,199
oh we can we can do this or we can do

135
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,720
this if the end uh we can do this we can

136
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,680
do this zero

137
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
times

138
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,919
length

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,720
nums this is another way to create a new

140
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,080
new array with the

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,400
values or zero okay this is a number so

142
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,400
okay

143
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,639
so now

144
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,960
now we have uh we will go through this

145
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,800
number for i in

146
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,600
numbers

147
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,000
right

148
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,000
if i is bigger than zero what happens

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,880
if i is bigger than zero now what should

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,960
we do

151
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,240
then we should put it in the first place

152
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,080
of a positive

153
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,960
so answer

154
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
what

155
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
p

156
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,039
p

157
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
equal our

158
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,639
you can figure out this

159
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,840
answer

160
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,199
and

161
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,550
equal sign

162
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,709
and

163
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,709
[Music]

164
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,880
next t o n okay

165
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,599
yeah that's one way yeah

166
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,639
easy two pointer thing yeah and now we

167
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,639
can do another one but

168
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,919
so these array yeah this array have uh n

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,680
positive number and negative number i

170
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,960
know ideally

171
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,000
so

172
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,599
ideally we need to divide this away into

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,599
two right

174
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,000
into two one positive one negative and

175
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:18,080
then we can combine we can pick one in

176
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,680
each right so if i i can find a way to

177
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,479
divide this answer into positive here

178
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,759
yeah

179
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,759
maintaining me away and then negative

180
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,360
yeah

181
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,199
yeah

182
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,639
and then i can pick one

183
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,560
for from each

184
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,440
and move this yeah this is another way

185
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
yeah

186
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,280
so how can we do this look we can do

187
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,280
this

188
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,319
okay so the positive we can do this that

189
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,440
positive equals

190
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,319
x

191
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
look

192
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,199
for

193
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,800
x in

194
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,520
numbers

195
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,479
if x bigger than zero yeah easy okay

196
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,520
that makes sense x i want to put x in

197
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,280
the positive this is a list this

198
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,039
complete enhancing comprehension

199
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,280
this is called this comprehension it

200
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,759
means that i create a list

201
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,280
and then i want to put an element x

202
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,560
and what's x actually it's in the

203
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,120
numbers

204
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,919
right in the original number but

205
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,440
x

206
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,039
there's another

207
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,319
condition which is x needs to bigger

208
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,280
than zero okay so what's negative

209
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,560
negative equals one come on

210
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,399
exactly the same but

211
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,320
x

212
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,800
uh

213
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,800
smaller than zero yeah

214
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,240
now i need to go through each one

215
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,120
look i have a partition

216
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,959
i have a position uh positive which is

217
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
this number i have a negative

218
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,040
if i put it this way

219
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,320
so what kind of function do you

220
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,320
remember

221
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,440
if we dip it then we'll take one animal

222
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,160
from each right

223
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,120
so then i can say for

224
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,440
x

225
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,200
in chip

226
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,360
positive

227
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,920
negative

228
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,240
and then i can say answer the append

229
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,800
open one i can say x yellow this is

230
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,640
positive and answer

231
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,360
a pen

232
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,640
x one which is negative yeah yeah

233
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,959
accent squeaky pen okay

234
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,360
if you don't write too you can also

235
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,000
write what you can call answer dot

236
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,959
extend extend takes another

237
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
array

238
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,760
and i can say

239
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,279
this is the array of x yellow

240
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,839
x one right this is also the same

241
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,839
right and then return

242
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,360
i want to take take

243
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,839
one positive take one negative and put

244
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,200
it in the open in the

245
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,640
on the right hand side apparently

246
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,519
remember that this opens to the right

247
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,000
yeah

248
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,560
okay so now we can have a better way to

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,440
do it okay

250
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,440
this is okay yeah textbook you know

251
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,120
using a for loop

252
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,120
we can do this we can do this one

253
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,320
we can do this uh

254
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,440
we can

255
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,480
so this this one partition negative we

256
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
can do this

257
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,680
nums

258
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,279
okay

259
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,760
start with zero

260
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,920
two column two

261
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,600
nums

262
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,040
one column two equals first

263
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,760
next and then return and written numbers

264
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,320
okay you might think this is

265
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,760
to understand this this is a total yeah

266
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:59,200
so what does it mean look yeah this

267
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,160
for example this array already equals 0

268
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,600
one two three four five okay this is a

269
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,480
list

270
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,800
a we know

271
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,040
we know we know this yeah

272
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,519
what's this mean

273
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,519
uh um

274
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,640
so look i here

275
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,120
so this is the list if

276
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,440
normally if we specify

277
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,040
uh index like one then you will tell me

278
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,800
which index there which value will

279
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,600
return single value right

280
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,160
yeah

281
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,079
if i sometimes you see this

282
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,440
yeah we see this

283
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,600
it means take

284
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,200
everything as a new copy it's a copy

285
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,720
here we talk about it

286
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,160
and if i say look from two to five what

287
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,920
does it mean

288
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,240
this is from right

289
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,240
wrong

290
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,079
this is true

291
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,560
yeah so

292
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,000
this is the same as range yeah another

293
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,600
range range two to five yeah parameters

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,639
do you still remember what what's the

295
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,760
third parameter of the range

296
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,800
step

297
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,480
step

298
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,760
star stop step so here if we have if we

299
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,000
have a

300
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,440
have two columns here so two columns

301
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,040
let's say

302
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,440
two columns so we can put the numbers

303
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,440
so we can put three parameters if we

304
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,519
don't put parameters then

305
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,839
if we don't put the first parameters the

306
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,839
first parameter is zero

307
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,160
if we don't put a second parameter the

308
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,920
second parameter is the

309
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,160
end

310
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,839
yeah it's still the end yeah

311
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,320
okay if we don't pull the third

312
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,639
parameter the third parameter is one

313
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,480
which means that equals one

314
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,519
right makes sense

315
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,760
so here means that start from the look

316
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,760
it doesn't have any the first parameter

317
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,720
so the first value is a zero it means

318
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,200
start from the first parameter look

319
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,839
from first parameter from first from

320
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,360
first element to the last element

321
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,360
because we don't have

322
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,120
we don't have these second

323
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
second parameter here so by default is

324
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
the n

325
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,399
the step is two so me what does it mean

326
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,279
it means

327
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,440
it means i take the first element

328
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,880
i start from the first element

329
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,440
i take

330
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,560
every i skip one element so i skip one

331
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,720
anime so here here here that's what we

332
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,440
mean and this one what does it mean

333
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,320
i take i start with the second element

334
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,680
and then i take i skip each element one

335
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,519
anime so look

336
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,839
this one this one this one

337
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,639
yeah

338
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,760
yeah what is this

339
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,680
so look this one the circle

340
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,360
equals the positive number

341
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,240
the triangle

342
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,000
the negative number makes sense

343
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,000
okay so

344
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
um

345
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,320
yeah so

346
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,959
so this is the same as look numbs

347
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,360
nothing nothing two is is actually

348
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,839
equals to zero and this will be the end

349
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,880
of it the end of uh lens nouns yeah we

350
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,360
can put a lens number here

351
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,440
and here is one and the second parameter

352
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,600
is now right

353
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,839
okay

354
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,839
yeah

355
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,440
so

356
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,440
okay this is array and i have uh

357
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,279
i comma j comma

358
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,440
k

359
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,720
okay can you tell me what's i was j was

360
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,000
k

361
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,440
and in

362
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,440
by default the values of it

363
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,120
i

364
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,639
am i is what

365
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,839
i is

366
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,880
the

367
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,199
star

368
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,360
star and by default if we don't give it

369
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,839
what's the value

370
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,040
what's the first value

371
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:58,040
zero the j is the

372
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,040
no no no k is the step j is

373
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,240
is say no it's like this

374
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,720
this this parameter isn't

375
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,320
it's not including that it's one element

376
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,360
plus right yeah look two five

377
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,040
you will get me give me the iterator of

378
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,040
two three four but not including five

379
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,639
yeah this is the same

380
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,240
j

381
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,240
yeah yes

382
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,480
by default it's the end of the if you

383
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,000
don't specify you will be the end of the

384
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,600
list iterator or whatever okay

385
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,160
by default

386
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,160
it is

387
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,440
well if we don't give it what's the step

388
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,480
for range two to five two three four

389
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,639
so what's the step one yes exactly so

390
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,800
now you understand when k is minus one

391
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,199
it's not reverse yeah yeah

392
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,720
got it one k is one minus one is the

393
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,800
inverse okay

394
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,959
and then k cannot be zero okay there's

395
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,000
no point if you put a zero step

396
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,440
yeah

397
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,279
listen yeah

398
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,839
it should be one positive or negative

399
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,199
but never zero okay

400
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,680
okay so

401
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,079
yeah two parts so this means that

402
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,360
i start from the first element i skip

403
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,680
every

404
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,480
skip one element each will be the

405
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,519
positive i will re-assign the positive

406
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,240
numbers

407
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,399
this one i start from the second element

408
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,680
i skip one anime each there will be no

409
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,759
negative number and then return the

410
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,440
numbers which one you think is the most

411
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,320
fancy one or

412
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,320
