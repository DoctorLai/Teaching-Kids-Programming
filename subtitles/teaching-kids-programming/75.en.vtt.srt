power of three okay so today similar we

8
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
power of three okay so today similar we
 

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,910
power of three okay so today similar we
will have

10
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920
will have
 

11
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,350
will have
five two i said about

12
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,360
five two i said about
 

13
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,710
five two i said about
two yeah power of two so can imagine can

14
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
two yeah power of two so can imagine can
 

15
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,029
two yeah power of two so can imagine can
you

16
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,039
you
 

17
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,870
you
apply this power of three aggregating

18
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
apply this power of three aggregating
 

19
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,029
apply this power of three aggregating
the power of two

20
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
the power of two
 

21
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,790
the power of two
uh yeah can we

22
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
uh yeah can we
 

23
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,669
uh yeah can we
i guess yeah yes yes okay so uh it's a

24
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
i guess yeah yes yes okay so uh it's a
 

25
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,630
i guess yeah yes yes okay so uh it's a
good exercise we can do this review okay

26
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,640
good exercise we can do this review okay
 

27
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,229
good exercise we can do this review okay
yeah and then i introduce one more

28
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
yeah and then i introduce one more
 

29
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,549
yeah and then i introduce one more
agreement in a specific to the power of

30
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
agreement in a specific to the power of
 

31
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,430
agreement in a specific to the power of
two

32
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
two
 

33
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,869
two
so are you okay all right

34
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
so are you okay all right
 

35
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,709
so are you okay all right
so can you tell me which algorithm you

36
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
so can you tell me which algorithm you
 

37
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,229
so can you tell me which algorithm you
remember from

38
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
remember from
 

39
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,470
remember from
to check if the power of two oh just

40
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
to check if the power of two oh just
 

41
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,790
to check if the power of two oh just
keep dividing by

42
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
keep dividing by
 

43
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,189
keep dividing by
two two okay so you tell me what to

44
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
two two okay so you tell me what to
 

45
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,229
two two okay so you tell me what to
write okay power

46
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
write okay power
 

47
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,350
write okay power
two okay and

48
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
two okay and
 

49
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,270
two okay and
if n smaller than alpha equals still

50
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
if n smaller than alpha equals still
 

51
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,630
if n smaller than alpha equals still
what one minute yeah if n smaller or

52
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
what one minute yeah if n smaller or
 

53
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,570
what one minute yeah if n smaller or
equals zero

54
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:04,580
equals zero
 

55
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,830
equals zero

56
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
[Music]
 

57
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,830
[Music]
and two of us

58
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
and two of us
 

59
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,190
and two of us
yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean mean okay if

60
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean mean okay if
 

61
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,510
yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean mean okay if
n

62
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
n
 

63
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,870
n
equals one three yeah because two yeah

64
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
equals one three yeah because two yeah
 

65
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,510
equals one three yeah because two yeah
because two to the power of zero

66
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
because two to the power of zero
 

67
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,789
because two to the power of zero
yeah okay okay now

68
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
yeah okay okay now
 

69
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,469
yeah okay okay now
look y wire

70
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
look y wire
 

71
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,710
look y wire
n can be divided by two

72
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720

 

73
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,990

and

74
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000

 

75
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,030

divide equal to right yes

76
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
divide equal to right yes
 

77
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,310
divide equal to right yes
yes written what

78
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
yes written what
 

79
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,990
yes written what
reason one return

80
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
reason one return
 

81
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,590
reason one return
n and what

82
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
n and what
 

83
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,910
n and what
when when look a to the power two

84
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
when when look a to the power two
 

85
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,990
when when look a to the power two
divided by two divided by two

86
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
divided by two divided by two
 

87
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,630
divided by two divided by two
divided by it will be two and divided by

88
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
divided by it will be two and divided by
 

89
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,630
divided by it will be two and divided by
two will be one and even nine can be

90
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
two will be one and even nine can be
 

91
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,590
two will be one and even nine can be
divided by two and

92
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
divided by two and
 

93
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,190
divided by two and
count which is one if six divided by two

94
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
count which is one if six divided by two
 

95
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,069
count which is one if six divided by two
equals three

96
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
equals three
 

97
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,309
equals three
three divided by 2 can't be equal so

98
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
three divided by 2 can't be equal so
 

99
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,190
three divided by 2 can't be equal so
it's 3.

100
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200
it's 3.
 

101
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,949
it's 3.
so if it's a power of 2 so n will be

102
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
so if it's a power of 2 so n will be
 

103
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,309
so if it's a power of 2 so n will be
divided until we get one what one

104
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
divided until we get one what one
 

105
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,270
divided until we get one what one
one yes well done it's the same look

106
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
one yes well done it's the same look
 

107
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,430
one yes well done it's the same look
yesterday 12 3 we just change this to

108
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
yesterday 12 3 we just change this to
 

109
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,550
yesterday 12 3 we just change this to
three

110
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
three
 

111
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,910
three
yeah do you remember yeah it's the same

112
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:25,920
yeah do you remember yeah it's the same
 

113
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,030
yeah do you remember yeah it's the same
okay so look n is an integer

114
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
okay so look n is an integer
 

115
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,589
okay so look n is an integer
we can replace this and if n is an

116
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
we can replace this and if n is an
 

117
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,150
we can replace this and if n is an
integer

118
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
integer
 

119
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,790
integer
n divided by two equals zero is the same

120
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
n divided by two equals zero is the same
 

121
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,190
n divided by two equals zero is the same
as

122
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
as
 

123
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,190
as
you know in the binary yeah in the

124
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
you know in the binary yeah in the
 

125
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,350
you know in the binary yeah in the
binary if it's an even number so

126
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
binary if it's an even number so
 

127
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,390
binary if it's an even number so
the last digit of the binary is zero so

128
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
the last digit of the binary is zero so
 

129
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,869
the last digit of the binary is zero so
it will be

130
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
it will be
 

131
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,630
it will be
n and n n yeah this is n

132
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
n and n n yeah this is n
 

133
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,750
n and n n yeah this is n
how do we write n n

134
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
how do we write n n
 

135
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,790
how do we write n n
1 equals 0 it's the same thing and then

136
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
1 equals 0 it's the same thing and then
 

137
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,830
1 equals 0 it's the same thing and then
n divided by 2 divided by 2

138
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
n divided by 2 divided by 2
 

139
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,470
n divided by 2 divided by 2
in binary right look this is what in

140
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480
in binary right look this is what in
 

141
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,110
in binary right look this is what in
binary

142
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
binary
 

143
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,710
binary
this is what number you binary

144
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
this is what number you binary
 

145
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,309
this is what number you binary
6 yeah this is what environment

146
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319

 

147
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,509

no no no that is the this is four in

148
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
no no no that is the this is four in
 

149
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,869
no no no that is the this is four in
binary yeah because two

150
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
binary yeah because two
 

151
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,149
binary yeah because two
one to the power of two is this is this

152
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
one to the power of two is this is this
 

153
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,229
one to the power of two is this is this
is four right one and this is what

154
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239

 

155
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,710

this is one in binary one times two

156
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
this is one in binary one times two
 

157
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,990
this is one in binary one times two
power one that's two

158
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
power one that's two
 

159
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,110
power one that's two
right yeah and this is what

160
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
right yeah and this is what
 

161
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,030
right yeah and this is what
what in binary one so do you get it

162
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
what in binary one so do you get it
 

163
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,830
what in binary one so do you get it
if you're moving moving one to the to

164
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
if you're moving moving one to the to
 

165
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,949
if you're moving moving one to the to
the right

166
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
the right
 

167
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,789
the right
then you'll be you'll be divided by two

168
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
then you'll be you'll be divided by two
 

169
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,910
then you'll be you'll be divided by two
right if you put a zero at the end

170
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
right if you put a zero at the end
 

171
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,789
right if you put a zero at the end
point times two okay so this thing is

172
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
point times two okay so this thing is
 

173
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,070
point times two okay so this thing is
you can do it like this

174
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
you can do it like this
 

175
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,830
you can do it like this
and shift shift equals one look

176
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
and shift shift equals one look
 

177
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,030
and shift shift equals one look
yeah two double

178
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
yeah two double
 

179
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,190
yeah two double
to greater than means that i want to

180
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
to greater than means that i want to
 

181
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,670
to greater than means that i want to
shift one position to the right yeah

182
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
shift one position to the right yeah
 

183
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,350
shift one position to the right yeah
and how about this n one one equals

184
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
and how about this n one one equals
 

185
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,030
and how about this n one one equals
smaller smaller equals one what does it

186
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
smaller smaller equals one what does it
 

187
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,789
smaller smaller equals one what does it
mean i want the shift

188
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
mean i want the shift
 

189
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,190
mean i want the shift
to the left yeah times two that is the

190
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
to the left yeah times two that is the
 

191
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,390
to the left yeah times two that is the
same

192
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
same
 

193
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,390
same
what's the complexity um

194
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:14,400
what's the complexity um
 

195
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,909
what's the complexity um
uh log base

196
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
uh log base
 

197
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,550
uh log base
no look three bass no there's no three

198
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
no look three bass no there's no three
 

199
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,030
no look three bass no there's no three
two

200
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
two
 

201
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,909
two
uh two i mean log two n yeah yes

202
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:24,919
uh two i mean log two n yeah yes
 

203
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,350
uh two i mean log two n yeah yes
yeah okay

204
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,360
yeah okay
 

205
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,870
yeah okay
okay let's divide by we can multiply

206
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
okay let's divide by we can multiply
 

207
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,909
okay let's divide by we can multiply
right look yeah x equals one yeah

208
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
right look yeah x equals one yeah
 

209
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,350
right look yeah x equals one yeah
you tell me y x

210
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
you tell me y x
 

211
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,830
you tell me y x
smaller than n right yes what's right

212
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
smaller than n right yes what's right
 

213
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,070
smaller than n right yes what's right
here

214
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
here
 

215
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,070
here
x1 x that's what

216
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
x1 x that's what
 

217
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,469
x1 x that's what
i want to times x equals two yeah x

218
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
i want to times x equals two yeah x
 

219
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,990
i want to times x equals two yeah x
equals x times two yeah

220
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
equals x times two yeah
 

221
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,150
equals x times two yeah
all you can do is shift t shift equals

222
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
all you can do is shift t shift equals
 

223
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,469
all you can do is shift t shift equals
one that means times two right

224
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
one that means times two right
 

225
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:05,270
one that means times two right
return

226
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280

 

227
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,469

[Applause]

228
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479

 

229
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,870

until you for example if i give you 33

230
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
until you for example if i give you 33
 

231
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,270
until you for example if i give you 33
and then 32 it can't be 30. yeah so

232
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
and then 32 it can't be 30. yeah so
 

233
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,029
and then 32 it can't be 30. yeah so
what's here remember it's the same as

234
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
what's here remember it's the same as
 

235
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,310
what's here remember it's the same as
yesterday yesterday is x time

236
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
yesterday yesterday is x time
 

237
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,310
yesterday yesterday is x time
not false come on you're not remembering

238
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
not false come on you're not remembering
 

239
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,230
not false come on you're not remembering
me i can't

240
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
me i can't
 

241
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,710
me i can't
i give a number i times a two and here

242
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
i give a number i times a two and here
 

243
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,590
i give a number i times a two and here
is bigger

244
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
is bigger
 

245
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,710
is bigger
or equal to n when it's equal

246
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
or equal to n when it's equal
 

247
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,830
or equal to n when it's equal
it's true when it's bigger it's false

248
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
it's true when it's bigger it's false
 

249
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,390
it's true when it's bigger it's false
okay so what should i write here x

250
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400

 

251
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,310

equal and then equal one

252
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
equal and then equal one
 

253
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,909
equal and then equal one
one no no no n come on

254
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
one no no no n come on
 

255
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,749
one no no no n come on
this thing look double double equal is

256
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
this thing look double double equal is
 

257
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,830
this thing look double double equal is
the same this thing

258
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
the same this thing
 

259
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,270
the same this thing
is the same as right

260
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
is the same as right
 

261
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,870
is the same as right
this is the same as this is the same as

262
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
this is the same as this is the same as
 

263
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,790
this is the same as this is the same as
if x equal equal n column between

264
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
if x equal equal n column between
 

265
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,960
if x equal equal n column between
what

266
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:05,970

 

267
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:13,029

[Music]

268
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039

 

269
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,909

yeah this is the same thing yeah this is

270
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
yeah this is the same thing yeah this is
 

271
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,029
yeah this is the same thing yeah this is
the same thing you see

272
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
the same thing you see
 

273
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,029
the same thing you see
yes okay so what's the term complexity

274
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039

 

275
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,870

yeah it's the same thing okay we can do

276
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
yeah it's the same thing okay we can do
 

277
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,950
yeah it's the same thing okay we can do
it recursively as well look

278
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
it recursively as well look
 

279
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,950
it recursively as well look
possibly n equals one return

280
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
possibly n equals one return
 

281
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,029
possibly n equals one return
return okay then return

282
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
return okay then return
 

283
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,270
return okay then return
it has to be divided by two yeah and

284
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
it has to be divided by two yeah and
 

285
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,309
it has to be divided by two yeah and
divided by

286
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
divided by
 

287
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,430
divided by
it should be an even number yeah even

288
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
it should be an even number yeah even
 

289
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:41,990
it should be an even number yeah even
number

290
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
number
 

291
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,110
number
and it looks like and n one m

292
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
and it looks like and n one m
 

293
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,309
and it looks like and n one m
power two and 1 divide divided by

294
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
power two and 1 divide divided by
 

295
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,749
power two and 1 divide divided by
2 right yeah yesterday it's it's the

296
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
2 right yeah yesterday it's it's the
 

297
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,150
2 right yeah yesterday it's it's the
same

298
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
same
 

299
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,150
same
divided by 3 yeah and then you change

300
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
divided by 3 yeah and then you change
 

301
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,350
divided by 3 yeah and then you change
this to n modulus

302
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
this to n modulus
 

303
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,510
this to n modulus
equals zero yeah yes okay so this is the

304
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
equals zero yeah yes okay so this is the
 

305
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,189
equals zero yeah yes okay so this is the
same okay and how about

306
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199
same okay and how about
 

307
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,629
same okay and how about
anything power three oh well look

308
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
anything power three oh well look
 

309
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,790
anything power three oh well look
if i do this if i basically we want to

310
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
if i do this if i basically we want to
 

311
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,110
if i do this if i basically we want to
to find if there's integer two to the

312
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
to find if there's integer two to the
 

313
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,550
to find if there's integer two to the
power of x equals n

314
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
power of x equals n
 

315
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,070
power of x equals n
right yeah yeah okay so x is

316
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
right yeah yeah okay so x is
 

317
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,510
right yeah yeah okay so x is
log 2 n right yes

318
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
log 2 n right yes
 

319
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,710
log 2 n right yes
okay so let's do this x equals log 2

320
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
okay so let's do this x equals log 2
 

321
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,110
okay so let's do this x equals log 2
and but this can be could be an integer

322
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
and but this can be could be an integer
 

323
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,870
and but this can be could be an integer
or not could be in this area

324
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
or not could be in this area
 

325
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,189
or not could be in this area
so we want to check if x is integer so

326
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
so we want to check if x is integer so
 

327
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,950
so we want to check if x is integer so
how can we do this

328
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
how can we do this
 

329
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,110
how can we do this
return 2 3 integer

330
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
return 2 3 integer
 

331
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,189
return 2 3 integer
convert into integer if it's equal to c

332
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
convert into integer if it's equal to c
 

333
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,350
convert into integer if it's equal to c
what does c i mean c so look

334
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
what does c i mean c so look
 

335
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,110
what does c i mean c so look
integer is the flaw so like 2.5

336
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
integer is the flaw so like 2.5
 

337
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,390
integer is the flaw so like 2.5
inch that is is 2

338
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
inch that is is 2
 

339
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,589
inch that is is 2
right into 2.5 is 2.

340
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
right into 2.5 is 2.
 

341
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,350
right into 2.5 is 2.
okay okay this way and int

342
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
okay okay this way and int
 

343
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,550
okay okay this way and int
and sia c what's c c means cr

344
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
and sia c what's c c means cr
 

345
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,830
and sia c what's c c means cr
two point five is three so it's okay

346
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840

 

347
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,189

it's ceiling yeah and integer is like a

348
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
it's ceiling yeah and integer is like a
 

349
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,150
it's ceiling yeah and integer is like a
flaw so so look at them two point five

350
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
flaw so so look at them two point five
 

351
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,270
flaw so so look at them two point five
seven is three

352
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
seven is three
 

353
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,070
seven is three
and four would be two right yeah oh okay

354
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
and four would be two right yeah oh okay
 

355
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,110
and four would be two right yeah oh okay
how about this

356
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
how about this
 

357
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,629
how about this
in in the one point nine into one point

358
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
in in the one point nine into one point
 

359
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,270
in in the one point nine into one point
equals one

360
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280

 

361
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,790

and zero one point nine

362
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
and zero one point nine
 

363
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,749
and zero one point nine
yes so so what does it mean here if it's

364
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
yes so so what does it mean here if it's
 

365
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,309
yes so so what does it mean here if it's
the

366
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
the
 

367
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,630
the
integer part and equals sieving power

368
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
integer part and equals sieving power
 

369
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,990
integer part and equals sieving power
okay so look

370
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
okay so look
 

371
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,110
okay so look
in in the two is two okay

372
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
in in the two is two okay
 

373
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,630
in in the two is two okay
here two is also two okay okay

374
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
here two is also two okay okay
 

375
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,949
here two is also two okay okay
yeah because if it's a whole integer

376
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
yeah because if it's a whole integer
 

377
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:43,670
yeah because if it's a whole integer
it's the same

378
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
it's the same
 

379
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,790
it's the same
yeah yeah okay so if it is an integer we

380
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
yeah yeah okay so if it is an integer we
 

381
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,509
yeah yeah okay so if it is an integer we
find

382
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:47,519
find
 

383
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,030
find
find this number okay what's the

384
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
find this number okay what's the
 

385
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,170
find this number okay what's the
complexity

386
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:51,180

00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:55,279
if we think this is a one so what's the

what if this function is a one constant

394
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
what if this function is a one constant
 

395
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,030
what if this function is a one constant
i assume it's

396
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
i assume it's
 

397
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,190
i assume it's
very very fast it's one yeah or one

398
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
very very fast it's one yeah or one
 

399
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,230
very very fast it's one yeah or one
constant okay

400
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
constant okay
 

401
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,269
constant okay
so this is better it's the fattest yes

402
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
so this is better it's the fattest yes
 

403
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,030
so this is better it's the fattest yes
yeah because i just do the calculation

404
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
yeah because i just do the calculation
 

405
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,750
yeah because i just do the calculation
yeah and how about if i can do this if

406
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
yeah and how about if i can do this if
 

407
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,430
yeah and how about if i can do this if
this is the integer i'll convert it to

408
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
this is the integer i'll convert it to
 

409
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,430
this is the integer i'll convert it to
initial part yeah integer

410
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
initial part yeah integer
 

411
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,269
initial part yeah integer
yeah and then i can do this return

412
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
yeah and then i can do this return
 

413
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,269
yeah and then i can do this return
to i'm giving y two times times x equals

414
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
to i'm giving y two times times x equals
 

415
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,949
to i'm giving y two times times x equals
three then there is two

416
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
three then there is two
 

417
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,070
three then there is two
this is i i get i i

418
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
this is i i get i i
 

419
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,949
this is i i get i i
compute the log to end and then i return

420
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
compute the log to end and then i return
 

421
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,550
compute the log to end and then i return
the integer path and i

422
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
the integer path and i
 

423
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,949
the integer path and i
reverse check i check 2 to the power of

x if it's equals n yeah
 

427
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:48,070
x if it's equals n yeah
yes yeah what's the time complexity

428
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080

 

429
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,470

yeah because this takes all log to l

430
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
yeah because this takes all log to l
 

431
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,509
yeah because this takes all log to l
yeah

432
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
yeah
 

433
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,670
yeah
this is the same thing as power function

434
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
this is the same thing as power function
 

435
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,550
this is the same thing as power function
as power to

x right this takes oh and oh look and
 

439
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,790
x right this takes oh and oh look and
remember we talked about this

440
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
remember we talked about this
 

441
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,829
remember we talked about this
before yeah two times if you times these

442
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
before yeah two times if you times these
 

443
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,030

445
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,150
x times
then is o n right n times yeah but we

446
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
then is o n right n times yeah but we
 

447
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,710
then is o n right n times yeah but we
can

448
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
can
 

449
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,990
can
we can actually depend on look okay

450
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
we can actually depend on look okay
 

451
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,030
we can actually depend on look okay

time you can
 

459
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,350
time you can
do this faster you you just need two

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
do this faster you you just need two
 

461
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,670
do this faster you you just need two
times instead of six times right

462

463
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,350

483
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,350

let's add white divided by two

484
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
let's add white divided by two
 

485
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,470
let's add white divided by two
yes okay and then like i have a curve

486
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
yes okay and then like i have a curve
 

487
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,509
yes okay and then like i have a curve
current value is two times times

488
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
current value is two times times
 

489
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,990
current value is two times times
meter yeah two to the power of me you

490
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
meter yeah two to the power of me you
 

491
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,030
meter yeah two to the power of me you
can write it as

492
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
can write it as
 

493
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,230
can write it as
as this way power to meet is the same

494
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
as this way power to meet is the same
 

495
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,670
as this way power to meet is the same
okay if current equals n

496
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
okay if current equals n
 

497
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,110
okay if current equals n
what do we do 10 if carry

498
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
what do we do 10 if carry
 

499
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,350
what do we do 10 if carry
equals equals we find the meter value

500
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
equals equals we find the meter value
 

501
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,829
equals equals we find the meter value
and we times it 2 to the power of mid

502
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
and we times it 2 to the power of mid
 

503
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,110
and we times it 2 to the power of mid
if it's 2 to the power of means

504
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
if it's 2 to the power of means
 

505
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,470
if it's 2 to the power of means
yeah we can true yeah and if

506
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
yeah we can true yeah and if
 

507
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,590
yeah we can true yeah and if
current is bigger than n so look

508
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
current is bigger than n so look
 

509
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,150
current is bigger than n so look
this is l this is r and we find the

510
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
this is l this is r and we find the
 

511
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,030
this is l this is r and we find the
meter if this

512
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
meter if this
 

513
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,069
meter if this
value is if this to the power mid is

514
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
value is if this to the power mid is
 

515
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,110
value is if this to the power mid is
bigger than the n

516
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
bigger than the n
 

517
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,630
bigger than the n
so where is it where where is it

518
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
so where is it where where is it
 

519
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,550
so where is it where where is it
is it in this sound itself if it's what

520
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
is it in this sound itself if it's what
 

521
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,110
is it in this sound itself if it's what
if this middle value to the volume is

522
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
if this middle value to the volume is
 

523
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,670
if this middle value to the volume is
bigger than

524
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
bigger than
 

525
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,870
bigger than
n so what's the value okay so what

526
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:56,880
n so what's the value okay so what
 

527
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,269
n so what's the value okay so what
should i

528
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
should i
 

529
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,100
should i
like here uh

except this one yesterday this is three
to the power meter yeah

552
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
to the power meter yeah
 

553
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,230
to the power meter yeah
yeah the only difference between the

554
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
yeah the only difference between the
 

555
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,590
yeah the only difference between the
power of three and power two

556

the final research is this one and that

558
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
the final research is this one and that
 

559
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,069
the final research is this one and that
one yeah yeah that is functional yeah

560
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
one yeah yeah that is functional yeah
 

561
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,829
one yeah yeah that is functional yeah
remember yesterday this is three yeah

562
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
remember yesterday this is three yeah
 

563
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,389
remember yesterday this is three yeah
okay

564
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
okay
 

565
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,030
okay
so what's the complexity divide yeah

566
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
so what's the complexity divide yeah
 

567
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,780
so what's the complexity divide yeah
what's the complexity

568
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:40,790
what's the complexity
 

569
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:45,430
what's the complexity

and what is it again

572
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
and what is it again
 

573
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,629
and what is it again
this is log n and yeah square you need

574
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
this is log n and yeah square you need
 

575
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,509
this is log n and yeah square you need
to square it

576
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
to square it
 

577
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,910
to square it
it's actually log n times log n because

578
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
it's actually log n times log n because
 

579
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,509
it's actually log n times log n because
this is log n

580
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
this is log n
 

581
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,230
this is log n
and the final research is okay okay so

582
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
and the final research is okay okay so
 

583
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,629
and the final research is okay okay so
it's

584
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
it's
 

585
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,110
it's
logan okay so for now we're just

586
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
logan okay so for now we're just
 

587
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,030
logan okay so for now we're just
reviewing the power three we can use the

588
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
reviewing the power three we can use the
 

589
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,990
reviewing the power three we can use the
power three aggregate

590
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
power three aggregate
 

591
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,829
power three aggregate
to the power of two to change these

592
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
to the power of two to change these
 

593
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,110
to the power of two to change these
three to low right

594
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
three to low right
 

595
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,470
three to low right
mostly and today we talk about something

596
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
mostly and today we talk about something
 

597
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,509
mostly and today we talk about something
very good very very specific for the

598
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
very good very very specific for the
 

599
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,389
very good very very specific for the
for the binary for the for the two

600
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
for the binary for the for the two
 

601
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,829
for the binary for the for the two
another two yeah

602
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
another two yeah
 

603
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,550
another two yeah
computer loves the number two right why

604
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:22,560
computer loves the number two right why
 

605
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,069
computer loves the number two right why
because the computer is based on the

606
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:24,079
because the computer is based on the
 

607
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,710
because the computer is based on the
binary

608
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
binary
 

609
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,870

yeah by computer computer understands

610
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
yeah by computer computer understands
 

611
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,710
yeah by computer computer understands
two numbers what are the two numbers

612
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
two numbers what are the two numbers
 

613
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,710
two numbers what are the two numbers
computer understand one and two

614
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
computer understand one and two
 

615
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,310
computer understand one and two
no yes because zlo you can

616
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
no yes because zlo you can
 

617
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,590
no yes because zlo you can

2 to the power of 3 equals 8 in binary
 

663
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,550
2 to the power of 3 equals 8 in binary
is what

664
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
is what
 

665
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,990
is what
1 zero zero zero yes

666
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
1 zero zero zero yes
 

667
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,150
1 zero zero zero yes
yeah two to the power of four equals one

668
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
yeah two to the power of four equals one
 

669
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,430
yeah two to the power of four equals one
sixteen one zero zero zero

670
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
sixteen one zero zero zero
 

671
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,550
sixteen one zero zero zero
four zero so do we need to

672
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
four zero so do we need to
 

673
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,550
four zero so do we need to
keep writing one one two three four five

674
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
keep writing one one two three four five
 

675
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,990
keep writing one one two three four five
okay so in binary if it's power of two

676
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
okay so in binary if it's power of two
 

677
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,350
okay so in binary if it's power of two
what is it it means that we only have

678
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
what is it it means that we only have
 

679
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,069
what is it it means that we only have
one one and followed by lots of zeros

680
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
one one and followed by lots of zeros
 

681
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:58,790
one one and followed by lots of zeros
yeah

682
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:58,800
yeah
 

683
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,870
yeah
yeah do you get it this is finally yeah

684
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
yeah do you get it this is finally yeah
 

685
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,150
yeah do you get it this is finally yeah
yeah okay

686
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
yeah okay
 

687
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,870
yeah okay
yeah so how can we do this how can we

688
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
yeah so how can we do this how can we
 

689
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,790
yeah so how can we do this how can we
find a binary remember

690
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
find a binary remember
 

691
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,230
find a binary remember
we use this n yeah n

692
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,240
we use this n yeah n
 

693
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,030
we use this n yeah n
and and logic this this this symbol yeah

694
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
and and logic this this this symbol yeah
 

695
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,990
and and logic this this this symbol yeah
yes

696
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
yes
 

697
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,189
yes
and logic yeah yeah this is n

698
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
and logic yeah yeah this is n
 

699
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,829
and logic yeah yeah this is n
in but if you want to end the binaries

700
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
in but if you want to end the binaries
 

701
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,110
in but if you want to end the binaries
you usually find

702
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
you usually find
 

703
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,750
you usually find
and then there's an oh okay so we just

704
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
and then there's an oh okay so we just
 

705
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,710
and then there's an oh okay so we just
talked about this n

706
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
talked about this n
 

707
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,150
talked about this n
yeah you know this symbol in the

708
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
yeah you know this symbol in the
 

709
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,069
yeah you know this symbol in the
keyboard in the keyboard here

710
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
keyboard in the keyboard here
 

711
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,710
keyboard in the keyboard here
yeah this one seven yeah seven you see

712
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
yeah this one seven yeah seven you see
 

713
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,990
yeah this one seven yeah seven you see
it's on the seventh

714
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
it's on the seventh
 

715
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,030
it's on the seventh
yeah this is n okay so what does it mean

716
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
yeah this is n okay so what does it mean
 

717
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,470
yeah this is n okay so what does it mean
in finally yeah

718
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
in finally yeah
 

719
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,990
in finally yeah
hey what does it mean it's something

720
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
hey what does it mean it's something
 

721
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,629
hey what does it mean it's something
like

722
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639

 

723
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,110

that's what it's like okay okay so we're

724
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,120
that's what it's like okay okay so we're
 

725
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,069
that's what it's like okay okay so we're
done look

726
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
done look
 

727
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,509
done look
look so these n yeah the numbers

728
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
look so these n yeah the numbers
 

729
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,470
look so these n yeah the numbers
numbers look in binary okay so look if

730
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
numbers look in binary okay so look if
 

731
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:58,790
numbers look in binary okay so look if
it's

732
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
it's
 

733
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,910
it's
four and three exactly

734
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
four and three exactly
 

735
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,550
four and three exactly
in person what so what what's the value

736
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
in person what so what what's the value
 

737
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,069
in person what so what what's the value
of four and three

738
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
of four and three
 

739
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,470
of four and three
so computer will change this to binary

740
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
so computer will change this to binary
 

741
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,269
so computer will change this to binary
which is

742
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
which is
 

743
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,389
which is
zero one one zero zero yeah and three

744
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
zero one one zero zero yeah and three
 

745
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,310
zero one one zero zero yeah and three
is what one zero one

746
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
is what one zero one
 

747
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,430
is what one zero one
uh zero one one zero one one yeah

748
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
uh zero one one zero one one yeah
 

749
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,389
uh zero one one zero one one yeah
because one

750
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:20,399
because one
 

751
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,870
because one
one plus two is three yeah that's four

752
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
one plus two is three yeah that's four
 

753
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,590
one plus two is three yeah that's four
yeah

754
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
yeah
 

755
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,269
yeah
yes so this n what does it mean

756
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
yes so this n what does it mean
 

757
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,509
yes so this n what does it mean
remember two and two is two two and

758
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
remember two and two is two two and
 

759
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,550
remember two and two is two two and
fourth is

760
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
fourth is
 

761
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,150
fourth is
first fourth and two is first first and

762
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
first fourth and two is first first and
 

763
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,550
first fourth and two is first first and
fourth is true yeah it has to be both

764
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
fourth is true yeah it has to be both
 

765
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:34,949
fourth is true yeah it has to be both
one

766
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
one
 

767
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,310
one
in order to one so this will be zero

768
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
in order to one so this will be zero
 

769
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,150
in order to one so this will be zero
this will be zero this will be zero okay

770
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
this will be zero this will be zero okay
 

771
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,430
this will be zero this will be zero okay
yes yes

772
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,440
yes yes
 

773
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,189
yes yes
do you get it so four so look

774
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
do you get it so four so look
 

775
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,790
do you get it so four so look
eight yeah a is the power of two

776
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
eight yeah a is the power of two
 

777
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,230
eight yeah a is the power of two
a is this one yes yes

778
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240
a is this one yes yes
 

779
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,430
a is this one yes yes
one zero zero zero if i substitute

780
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
one zero zero zero if i substitute
 

781
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,829
one zero zero zero if i substitute
if i substitute seven what's seven seven

782
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
if i substitute seven what's seven seven
 

783
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,230
if i substitute seven what's seven seven
is no

784
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
is no
 

785
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,029
is no
power two i know seven is what zero one

786
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
power two i know seven is what zero one
 

787
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,390
power two i know seven is what zero one
one one right

788
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
one one right
 

789
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,189
one one right
yes so the end together will be zero

790
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
yes so the end together will be zero
 

791
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:11,669
yes so the end together will be zero
okay

792
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:11,679
okay
 

793
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,789
okay
another one sixteen sixteen one zero

794
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
another one sixteen sixteen one zero
 

795
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,990
another one sixteen sixteen one zero
zero zero zero

796
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
zero zero zero
 

797
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,029
zero zero zero
minus one is what zero one one one one

798
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
minus one is what zero one one one one
 

799
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:19,829
minus one is what zero one one one one
yeah

800
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
yeah
 

801
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,510
yeah
yeah you end zero so look at it

802
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
yeah you end zero so look at it
 

803
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,870
yeah you end zero so look at it
yes this one minus one zero one one one

804
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
yes this one minus one zero one one one
 

805
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,669
yes this one minus one zero one one one
one one

806
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
one one
 

807
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,710
one one
you end zero

808
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
you end zero
 

809
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,590
you end zero
yeah because look at zero and one is n

810
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
yeah because look at zero and one is n
 

811
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,029
yeah because look at zero and one is n
is zero okay

812
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:35,039
is zero okay
 

813
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,470
is zero okay
do you get it because you only have one

814
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
do you get it because you only have one
 

815
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,470
do you get it because you only have one
one yeah you substitute one all the

816
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
one yeah you substitute one all the
 

817
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,230
one yeah you substitute one all the
zeros become one yeah

818
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
zeros become one yeah
 

819
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,710
zeros become one yeah
and then this becomes zero yeah so you

820
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
and then this becomes zero yeah so you
 

821
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,710
and then this becomes zero yeah so you
end together will be zero

822
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
end together will be zero
 

823
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,350
end together will be zero
so what so what can we do look define

824
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
so what so what can we do look define
 

825
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,310
so what so what can we do look define
power tool

826
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
power tool
 

827
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,990
power tool
if it's a power of 2 then you minus 1

828
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
if it's a power of 2 then you minus 1
 

829
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,430
if it's a power of 2 then you minus 1
then yes and

830
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
then yes and
 

831
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,990
then yes and
return first of all it has to be bigger

832
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
return first of all it has to be bigger
 

833
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:10,230
return first of all it has to be bigger
than zero yeah bigger

834
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240

 

835
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:17,750

yeah what should i put here

836
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760

 

837
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,669

what's this number this is n what's this

838
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
what's this number this is n what's this
 

839
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,510
what's this number this is n what's this
number n minus one

840
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
number n minus one
 

841
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:31,510
number n minus one
yeah and it will be yes

842
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:31,520

 

843
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,110

this is the fastest what's the time

844
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
this is the fastest what's the time
 

845
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,350
this is the fastest what's the time

846
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
complexity
 

847
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,470
complexity
oh one yes what's the spray complexity i

848
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
oh one yes what's the spray complexity i
 

849
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:48,170
oh one yes what's the spray complexity i
i i i i

850

[Music]
 

853
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,710
[Music]
okay so which one is the price the

854
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
okay so which one is the price the
 

855
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,950
okay so which one is the price the
better best

856
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
better best
 

857
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,190
better best
this one yes of course look this is

858
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
this one yes of course look this is
 

859
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,510
this one yes of course look this is
magic yeah binary magic because computer

860
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
magic yeah binary magic because computer
 

861
00:18:59,520 --> 00:18:59,909
magic yeah binary magic because computer
laughs

862
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
laughs
 

863
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,230

battery and then based on the binary we

864
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240
battery and then based on the binary we
 

865
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,310
battery and then based on the binary we
can just check if the integer is power

866
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
can just check if the integer is power
 

867
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,830
can just check if the integer is power
of two just using this

868
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
of two just using this
 

869
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,750
of two just using this
it's amazing yeah it's quite amazing

870
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
it's amazing yeah it's quite amazing
 

871

yeah yeah we've got lots of
 

873
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,190
yeah yeah we've got lots of
algorithm this is the fastest because

874
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,200
algorithm this is the fastest because
 

875
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,350
algorithm this is the fastest because
it's a one it doesn't matter if you

876
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
it's a one it doesn't matter if you
 

877
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,470
it's a one it doesn't matter if you
add this opinion a million a trillion it

878
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480
add this opinion a million a trillion it
 

879
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,510
add this opinion a million a trillion it
doesn't matter

880

do first what do we do yeah
 

897
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,870
do first what do we do yeah
check the power of 2 yeah if n smaller

898
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
check the power of 2 yeah if n smaller
 

899
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,750
check the power of 2 yeah if n smaller
equals

900
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
equals
 

901
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,590
equals
0 what's here and then

902
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
0 what's here and then
 

903
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,870
0 what's here and then
okay x equals 1 y

904
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
okay x equals 1 y
 

905
00:19:48,880 --> 00:20:04,830
okay x equals 1 y
x smaller than n

906
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840

 

907
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,710

x you turn x equals equals n

908
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
x you turn x equals equals n
 

909
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,710
x you turn x equals equals n
yes good job okay good job

910
