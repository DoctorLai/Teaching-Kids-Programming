some of four remember we have talked
 

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,790
some of four remember we have talked
about two sums three thumbs right

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:18,800
about two sums three thumbs right
 

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,550
about two sums three thumbs right
now we talk about four sums sum of four

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560

 

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,589

but today because number four is one

12
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
but today because number four is one
 

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,870
but today because number four is one
plus three t

14
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
plus three t

00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
summer fall is basically like uh
 

23
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,190
summer fall is basically like uh
picking four numbers and you have a

24
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
picking four numbers and you have a
 

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,310
picking four numbers and you have a
target

26
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
target
 

27
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,990
target
wear them and we have a lot we have

28
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
wear them and we have a lot we have
 

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,510
wear them and we have a lot we have
different ways of doing that but today

30
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
different ways of doing that but today
 

31
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,069
different ways of doing that but today
we are going to talk about using um

32
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
we are going to talk about using um
 

33
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,110
we are going to talk about using um
you already know people network no fair

34
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
you already know people network no fair
 

35
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,110
you already know people network no fair
something

36
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
something
 

37
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,389
something
yeah kind of performing yeah

38
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
yeah kind of performing yeah
 

39
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,670
yeah kind of performing yeah
how come yeah yeah good question

40
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
how come yeah yeah good question
 

41
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,469
how come yeah yeah good question
so let's pick two pick uh four numbers

42
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
so let's pick two pick uh four numbers
 

43
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,509
so let's pick two pick uh four numbers
so let's say two

44
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
so let's say two
 

45
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,270
so let's say two
three four six seven

46
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
three four six seven
 

47
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,830
three four six seven
nine let's pick let's see if they these

48
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
nine let's pick let's see if they these
 

49
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,830
nine let's pick let's see if they these
any pick any numbers

50
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
any pick any numbers
 

51
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,670
any pick any numbers
can add it to uh let's say 21 okay we

52
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:17,680
can add it to uh let's say 21 okay we
 

53
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,870
can add it to uh let's say 21 okay we
want to find the 21

54
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
want to find the 21
 

55
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,950
want to find the 21
if they have any four numbers adding to

56
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
if they have any four numbers adding to
 

57
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,310
if they have any four numbers adding to
41.

58
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
41.
 

59
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,469
41.
yeah you just need to tell me if it's

60
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
yeah you just need to tell me if it's
 

61
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,990
yeah you just need to tell me if it's
two or four that's true

62
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
two or four that's true
 

63
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,149
two or four that's true
if you can find four numbers four

64
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
if you can find four numbers four
 

65
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,590
if you can find four numbers four
distinct distant

66
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
distinct distant
 

67
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,149
distinct distant
distinct unique number this thing yeah

68
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
distinct unique number this thing yeah
 

69
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:32,950
distinct unique number this thing yeah
you know listen

70
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
you know listen
 

71
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,149
you know listen
distinct unique numbers four unique

72
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
distinct unique numbers four unique
 

73
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,030
distinct unique numbers four unique
numbers you cannot pick one number twice

74
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
numbers you cannot pick one number twice
 

75
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,109
numbers you cannot pick one number twice
yeah you only pick four numbers we only

76
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119
yeah you only pick four numbers we only
 

77
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,950
yeah you only pick four numbers we only
pick four numbers

78
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
pick four numbers
 

79
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,550
pick four numbers
let's sum up to target 21 so we

80
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
let's sum up to target 21 so we
 

81
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,550
let's sum up to target 21 so we
i give you a hint we can use the default

82
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
i give you a hint we can use the default
 

83
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,469
i give you a hint we can use the default
search of course we can have a two

84
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
search of course we can have a two
 

85
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,350
search of course we can have a two
pointer thing

86
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
pointer thing
 

87
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,109
pointer thing
but let's make it tomorrow or you know

88
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
but let's make it tomorrow or you know
 

89
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,709
but let's make it tomorrow or you know
in the future but today we're going to

90
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
in the future but today we're going to
 

91
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,030
in the future but today we're going to
focus using that research to solve this

92
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
focus using that research to solve this
 

93
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,749
focus using that research to solve this
problem

94
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
problem
 

95
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,789
problem
it's this one this one yeah and this is

96
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
it's this one this one yeah and this is
 

97
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,830
it's this one this one yeah and this is
this one

98
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:05,840

 

99
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,350

five yeah all 10 1 for 6.

100
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
five yeah all 10 1 for 6.
 

101
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,910
five yeah all 10 1 for 6.
i was thinking but again it's the same

102
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
i was thinking but again it's the same
 

103
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,270
i was thinking but again it's the same
with different answers yes

104
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
with different answers yes
 

105
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,229
with different answers yes
but we listen to it we only need to tear

106
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
but we listen to it we only need to tear
 

107
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,150
but we listen to it we only need to tear
we only need to tell if it's possible to

108
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
we only need to tell if it's possible to
 

109
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,790
we only need to tell if it's possible to
use the four numbers the sum of the 21

110
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
use the four numbers the sum of the 21
 

111
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,270
use the four numbers the sum of the 21
10 19 no that's only three numbers

112
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
10 19 no that's only three numbers
 

113
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,110
10 19 no that's only three numbers
yeah we're on the four numbers yeah so

114
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
yeah we're on the four numbers yeah so
 

115
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,589
yeah we're on the four numbers yeah so
10 one

116
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
10 one
 

117
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,710
10 one
four six or three seven yeah yeah

118
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
four six or three seven yeah yeah
 

119
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,830
four six or three seven yeah yeah
okay so for this so how can we use the

120
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
okay so for this so how can we use the
 

121
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,630
okay so for this so how can we use the
default search

122
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
default search
 

123
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,150
default search
i'll give you a hint that for this

124
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
i'll give you a hint that for this
 

125
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,030
i'll give you a hint that for this
number i can we we can go through these

126
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
number i can we we can go through these
 

127
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,869
number i can we we can go through these
we can search from the beginning

128
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
we can search from the beginning
 

129
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,630
we can search from the beginning
to the right yeah from the beginning to

130
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
to the right yeah from the beginning to
 

131
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,630
to the right yeah from the beginning to
the right for each number we can we how

132
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
the right for each number we can we how
 

133
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,790
the right for each number we can we how
many choice do we have

134
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
many choice do we have
 

135
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,309
many choice do we have
how many choices do we have number one

136
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
how many choices do we have number one
 

137
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,229
how many choices do we have number one
if look if i have a different search

138
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
if look if i have a different search
 

139
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,509
if look if i have a different search
function right

140
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
function right
 

141
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,390
function right
if i have a you know which number have

142
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
if i have a you know which number have
 

143
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,110
if i have a you know which number have
we picked

144
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
we picked
 

145
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,390
we picked
so far we have a left 10 and then we

146
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
so far we have a left 10 and then we
 

147
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,550
so far we have a left 10 and then we
have a count how many numbers we have a

148
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
have a count how many numbers we have a
 

149
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,830
have a count how many numbers we have a
pick so far

150
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
pick so far
 

151
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,550
pick so far
and then the remaining sum okay the

152
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
and then the remaining sum okay the
 

153
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,070
and then the remaining sum okay the
remaining sum

154
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
remaining sum
 

155
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,229
remaining sum
doesn't make sense so at the beginning

156
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
doesn't make sense so at the beginning
 

157
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,350
doesn't make sense so at the beginning
we can put this as

158
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
we can put this as
 

159
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,589
we can put this as
which the target right we want to pick

160
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
which the target right we want to pick
 

161
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,270
which the target right we want to pick
this number right the target

162
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
this number right the target
 

163
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,790
this number right the target
yeah all right and then this

164
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
yeah all right and then this
 

165
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,949
yeah all right and then this
card at the beginning will be zero all

166
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
card at the beginning will be zero all
 

167
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,070
card at the beginning will be zero all
right

168
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
right
 

169
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,949
right
and then we are we need to check if the

170
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
and then we are we need to check if the
 

171
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,630
and then we are we need to check if the
count equals four right

172
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
count equals four right
 

173
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,470
count equals four right
we only need the four numbers and left

174
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
we only need the four numbers and left
 

175
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,990
we only need the four numbers and left
will be beginning so for

176
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000
will be beginning so for
 

177
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,070
will be beginning so for
each one let's go to the left to the

178
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
each one let's go to the left to the
 

179
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,190
each one let's go to the left to the
right for each one

180
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
right for each one
 

181
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,750
right for each one
for each left suppose left is here for

182
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
for each left suppose left is here for
 

183
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,430
for each left suppose left is here for
this ten

184
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
this ten
 

185
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,949
this ten
how many choices do we have for the

186
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
how many choices do we have for the
 

187
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,830
how many choices do we have for the
number ten

188
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
number ten
 

189
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,550
number ten
uh then i'm just talking about a 10

190
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
uh then i'm just talking about a 10
 

191
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,910
uh then i'm just talking about a 10
how many choices do we for this term

192
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
how many choices do we for this term
 

193
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,869
how many choices do we for this term
in the final answer like do we have a we

194
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
in the final answer like do we have a we
 

195
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,710
in the final answer like do we have a we
can pick it and not take it well

196
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
can pick it and not take it well
 

197
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,789
can pick it and not take it well
that's what i'm looking for for each

198
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
that's what i'm looking for for each
 

199
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,470
that's what i'm looking for for each
number we have two choice

200
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
number we have two choice
 

201
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,110
number we have two choice
pick it or not pick it for pick it if i

202
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
pick it or not pick it for pick it if i
 

203
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,270
pick it or not pick it for pick it if i
pick it what happened to this count

204
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
pick it what happened to this count
 

205
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,309
pick it what happened to this count
you add column will be valid

206
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
you add column will be valid
 

207
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,990
you add column will be valid
no the count will be how many numbers we

208
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
no the count will be how many numbers we
 

209
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,750
no the count will be how many numbers we
have picked so now so what happened to

210
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
have picked so now so what happened to
 

211
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,019
have picked so now so what happened to
the count if i pick it

212
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:17,029

[Music]
how many numbers do we need to pick how

216
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
how many numbers do we need to pick how
 

217
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,069
how many numbers do we need to pick how
many numbers have we picked so far

218
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
many numbers have we picked so far
 

219
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,670
many numbers have we picked so far
if we pick this number so how do i one

220
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
if we pick this number so how do i one
 

221
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,350
if we pick this number so how do i one
add one add one okay so target would be

222
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
add one add one okay so target would be
 

223
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,469
add one add one okay so target would be
what how many numbers do we need to

224
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
what how many numbers do we need to
 

225
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,189
what how many numbers do we need to
the sum will be minus ten yeah minus the

226
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
the sum will be minus ten yeah minus the
 

227
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,230
the sum will be minus ten yeah minus the
number right

228
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
number right
 

229
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,110
number right
yes yeah okay let's say minus ten and

230
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
yes yeah okay let's say minus ten and
 

231
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,909
yes yeah okay let's say minus ten and
then left

232
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
then left
 

233
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,909
then left
then we can go through the next one will

234
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
then we can go through the next one will
 

235
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,350
then we can go through the next one will
be left plus one right

236
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
be left plus one right
 

237
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,710
be left plus one right
yeah yeah this is if we pick and how

238
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
yeah yeah this is if we pick and how
 

239
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,390
yeah yeah this is if we pick and how
about if we don't pick

240
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
about if we don't pick
 

241
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,030
about if we don't pick
if we don't pick this one right and this

242
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
if we don't pick this one right and this
 

243
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,870
if we don't pick this one right and this
is the spear left plus one right because

244
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
is the spear left plus one right because
 

245
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,110
is the spear left plus one right because
we're considering the next number right

246
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
we're considering the next number right
 

247
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,870
we're considering the next number right
counter will be what will happen what

248
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
counter will be what will happen what
 

249
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,870
counter will be what will happen what
happened to discount if we don't pick

250
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
happened to discount if we don't pick
 

251
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,870
happened to discount if we don't pick
this what happened to this car

252
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
this what happened to this car
 

253
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,189
this what happened to this car
look at this if we don't pick this

254
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
look at this if we don't pick this
 

255
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:03,909
look at this if we don't pick this
number

256
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
number
 

257
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,870
number
so no no if we don't pick this number

258
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
so no no if we don't pick this number
 

259
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,629
so no no if we don't pick this number
what happens on the count

260
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
what happens on the count
 

261
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,990
what happens on the count
yes yeah yeah and then this target will

262
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
yes yeah yeah and then this target will
 

263
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,230
yes yeah yeah and then this target will
be

264
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
be
 

265
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,510
be
one the same person

266
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
one the same person
 

267
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,990
one the same person
so you see so the only two choice we

268
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
so you see so the only two choice we
 

269
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,790
so you see so the only two choice we
definitely search

270
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
definitely search
 

271
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,830
definitely search
if we pick top plus one cop

272
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
if we pick top plus one cop
 

273
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,230
if we pick top plus one cop
that plus one complex one target minus

274
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
that plus one complex one target minus
 

275
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,189
that plus one complex one target minus
this number

276
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
this number
 

277
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,350
this number
if we don't pick we just skip to left

278
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
if we don't pick we just skip to left
 

279
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,550
if we don't pick we just skip to left
past one right

280
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
past one right
 

281
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,790
past one right
and then when left reach the end we

282
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
and then when left reach the end we
 

283
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,310
and then when left reach the end we
determine first because we run up the

284
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
determine first because we run up the
 

285
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,029
determine first because we run up the
numbers

286
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
numbers
 

287
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,230
numbers
if count equals four

288
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
if count equals four
 

289
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,469
if count equals four
so look if car equals four what should

290
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
so look if car equals four what should
 

291
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,390
so look if car equals four what should
we do now if we have already picked four

292
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
we do now if we have already picked four
 

293
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,350
we do now if we have already picked four
numbers

294
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
numbers
 

295
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,670
numbers
but the target is not zero so what does

296
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
but the target is not zero so what does
 

297
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,590
but the target is not zero so what does
it mean

298
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
it mean
 

299
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,990
it mean
what what if we have to pick four

300
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
what what if we have to pick four
 

301
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,790
what what if we have to pick four
numbers

302
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
numbers
 

303
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,870
numbers
but the target the remaining sum is not

304
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
but the target the remaining sum is not
 

305
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,430
but the target the remaining sum is not
zero what does it mean

306
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
zero what does it mean
 

307
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,670
zero what does it mean
remaining sum remember if we pick 10 we

308
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
remaining sum remember if we pick 10 we
 

309
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,430
remaining sum remember if we pick 10 we
need to minus 10 right

310
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
need to minus 10 right
 

311
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,590
need to minus 10 right
if it's that if we already pick four

312
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
if it's that if we already pick four
 

313
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,189
if it's that if we already pick four
numbers and then current sum

314
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
numbers and then current sum
 

315
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,150
numbers and then current sum
the current remaining is not zero what

316
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
the current remaining is not zero what
 

317
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,870
the current remaining is not zero what
does it mean

318
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
does it mean
 

319
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,150
does it mean
it means that what's the target remember

320
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
it means that what's the target remember
 

321
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,070
it means that what's the target remember
we want to pick 21 at the beginning is

322
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
we want to pick 21 at the beginning is
 

323
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,189
we want to pick 21 at the beginning is
21 right

324
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
21 right
 

325
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,029
21 right
why not fit 21. and then you will pick

326
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
why not fit 21. and then you will pick
 

327
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,790
why not fit 21. and then you will pick
10 with 21 minus 10 and

328
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
10 with 21 minus 10 and
 

329
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,830
10 with 21 minus 10 and
we have a remaining 11 to pick right

330
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
we have a remaining 11 to pick right
 

331
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,110
we have a remaining 11 to pick right
if this cow equals four if we already

332
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
if this cow equals four if we already
 

333
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,029
if this cow equals four if we already
get four numbers but the remaining is

334
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
get four numbers but the remaining is
 

335
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,710
get four numbers but the remaining is
not zero what does it mean

336
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
not zero what does it mean
 

337
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,670
not zero what does it mean
it means four that means you can you

338
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
it means four that means you can you
 

339
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,230
it means four that means you can you
have to

340
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
have to
 

341
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,469
have to
try again yeah yeah that means that

342
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
try again yeah yeah that means that
 

343
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,909
try again yeah yeah that means that
fourth yeah because

344
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
fourth yeah because
 

345
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,590
fourth yeah because
that's what i mean if it's yellow it

346
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
that's what i mean if it's yellow it
 

347
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,670
that's what i mean if it's yellow it
means that one it's true yeah we found

348
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
means that one it's true yeah we found
 

349
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,950
means that one it's true yeah we found
the four numbers right

350
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
the four numbers right
 

351
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,189
the four numbers right
yeah so does it make sense this one okay

352
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
yeah so does it make sense this one okay
 

353
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,309
yeah so does it make sense this one okay
let's divide it

354
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
let's divide it
 

355
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,670
let's divide it
ryan do you understand

356
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
ryan do you understand
 

357
00:06:43,680 --> 00:07:00,950
ryan do you understand
full time

358
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960

 

359
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,790

how long we define the definitions here

360
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
how long we define the definitions here
 

361
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,629
how long we define the definitions here
right before seven

362
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
right before seven
 

363
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,230
right before seven
and we have a left yeah left and call

364
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
and we have a left yeah left and call
 

365
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,589
and we have a left yeah left and call
okay and then attack it yeah another

366
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
okay and then attack it yeah another
 

367
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,350
okay and then attack it yeah another
time yeah

368
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
time yeah
 

369
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,029
time yeah
okay look alex

370
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
okay look alex
 

371
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,150
okay look alex
if how all right

372
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
if how all right
 

373
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,710
if how all right
if count equals equals four we have

374
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
if count equals equals four we have
 

375
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,550
if count equals equals four we have
already picked four numbers

376
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
already picked four numbers
 

377
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,070
already picked four numbers
so what should we return it

378
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
so what should we return it
 

379
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,350
so what should we return it
so return t

380
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
so return t
 

381
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,270
so return t
equal equals zero right doesn't make

382
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
equal equals zero right doesn't make
 

383
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,469
equal equals zero right doesn't make
sense

384
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
sense
 

385
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,629
sense
if left bigger or equal than

386
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
if left bigger or equal than
 

387
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,270
if left bigger or equal than
grams what should we do now return one

388
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
grams what should we do now return one
 

389
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,869
grams what should we do now return one
if we have run out of numbers what

390
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
if we have run out of numbers what
 

391
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,790
if we have run out of numbers what
should we do if it lands

392
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
should we do if it lands
 

393
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,990
should we do if it lands
yeah return first okay

394
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
yeah return first okay
 

395
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,150
yeah return first okay
okay and now we have two choice yeah

396
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
okay and now we have two choice yeah
 

397
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,670
okay and now we have two choice yeah
we have two choices yeah let's say pick

398
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
we have two choices yeah let's say pick
 

399
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,830
we have two choices yeah let's say pick
pick equals what dfs

400
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
pick equals what dfs
 

401
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,150
pick equals what dfs
left plus one right and then what we

402
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
left plus one right and then what we
 

403
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,430
left plus one right and then what we
picked can you tell me what what should

404
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
picked can you tell me what what should
 

405
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,869
picked can you tell me what what should
i put here

406
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
i put here
 

407
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,869
i put here
left past one and then if we pick right

408
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
left past one and then if we pick right
 

409
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,790
left past one and then if we pick right
one count minus

410
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
one count minus
 

411
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,710
one count minus
one

412
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720

 

413
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,710

if we pick a count how many numbers we

414
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
if we pick a count how many numbers we
 

415
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,309
if we pick a count how many numbers we
pick one one and then

416
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
pick one one and then
 

417
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:37,509
pick one one and then
target minus

418
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519

 

419
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,149

skip this number and count one just now

420
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
skip this number and count one just now
 

421
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,190
skip this number and count one just now
yeah

422
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
yeah
 

423
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,110
yeah
and then t and then what retinoia

424
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120

 

425
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,230

we can return what we have pick and not

426
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
we can return what we have pick and not
 

427
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,389
we can return what we have pick and not
pick so let's resize what pick

428
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
pick so let's resize what pick
 

429
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,070
pick so let's resize what pick
not pig so eat one of them is true then

430
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
not pig so eat one of them is true then
 

431
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,190
not pig so eat one of them is true then
it's two right

432
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
it's two right
 

433
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,310
it's two right
yeah written pick

434
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
yeah written pick
 

435
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,389
yeah written pick
or not not pick

436
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399

437
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,389

remember this is not pig is the

438
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
remember this is not pig is the

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
not right okay and then here
 

443
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,030
not right okay and then here
i should i just call this one here right

444
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040

that's it does it make sense dfs
 

467
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,710
that's it does it make sense dfs
yeah let me define your inline bfs

468
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
yeah let me define your inline bfs

00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
what's our time complexity uh and
 

473
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,269
what's our time complexity uh and
we are picking four numbers so how many

474
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
we are picking four numbers so how many
 

475
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,870
we are picking four numbers so how many
kinds of solutions is it

476
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
kinds of solutions is it
 

477
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,990
kinds of solutions is it
no four oh and four oh four one

478
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
no four oh and four oh four one
 

479
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,430
no four oh and four oh four one
oh and one oh and

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,630
oh and one oh and
to the power four yeah yeah yeah that's

482
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
to the power four yeah yeah yeah that's
 

483
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,990
to the power four yeah yeah yeah that's
quite because look we have we we are

484
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
quite because look we have we we are
 

485
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,790
quite because look we have we we are
picking for

486
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
picking for
 

487
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,310
picking for
then for the next one stays

488
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
then for the next one stays
 

489
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,750
then for the next one stays
uh space complexity for why is it oh and

490
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
uh space complexity for why is it oh and
 

491
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,710
uh space complexity for why is it oh and
so

492
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
so
 

493
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,350
so
why is alpha because they're given n

494
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
why is alpha because they're given n
 

495
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:15,990
why is alpha because they're given n
numbers

496
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
numbers
 

497
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,670
numbers
we can iterate these n numbers for

498
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
we can iterate these n numbers for
 

499
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,310
we can iterate these n numbers for
in the four roof right yeah choosing

500
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
in the four roof right yeah choosing
 

501
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,509
in the four roof right yeah choosing
four numbers right

502
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
four numbers right
 

503
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,590
four numbers right
doesn't make sense all right so we can

504
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
doesn't make sense all right so we can
 

505
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,870
doesn't make sense all right so we can
change the four

506
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
change the four
 

507
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,990
change the four
i in length right for

508
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
i in length right for
 

509
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,750
i in length right for
j for first number in numbers for n for

510
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
j for first number in numbers for n for
 

511
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,350
j for first number in numbers for n for
second number in numbers for certain

512
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
second number in numbers for certain
 

513
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,389
second number in numbers for certain
numbers in numbers

514
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
numbers in numbers
 

515
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,630
numbers in numbers
and of course for false numbers in them

516
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
and of course for false numbers in them
 

517
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,710
and of course for false numbers in them
okay and then we can prove us it doesn't

518
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
okay and then we can prove us it doesn't
 

519
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,829
okay and then we can prove us it doesn't
make sense

520
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
make sense
 

521
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,230
make sense
yeah we can actually do using this kind

522
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
yeah we can actually do using this kind
 

523
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,509
yeah we can actually do using this kind
of solution therefore

524
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
of solution therefore
 

525
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,069
of solution therefore
first number is numb for second number

526
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
first number is numb for second number
 

527
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,750
first number is numb for second number
numbs

528
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
numbs
 

529
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,509
numbs
why the second number is not equal to

530
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
why the second number is not equal to
 

531
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,829
why the second number is not equal to
the first number yeah

532
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
the first number yeah
 

533
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,829
the first number yeah
so actually we can use the range for i

534
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
so actually we can use the range for i
 

535
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,750
so actually we can use the range for i
in zero to lunge for j

536
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
in zero to lunge for j
 

537
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,030
in zero to lunge for j
in i plus one to lungs to n for k

538
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
in i plus one to lungs to n for k
 

539
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,750
in i plus one to lungs to n for k
equals j plus 1 to n for

540
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
equals j plus 1 to n for
 

541
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,030
equals j plus 1 to n for
u equals k plus 1

542
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
u equals k plus 1
 

543
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,870
u equals k plus 1
to n and then if nums i plus num

544
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
to n and then if nums i plus num
 

545
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,630
to n and then if nums i plus num
z plus nums k plus lumps u equals t

546
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
z plus nums k plus lumps u equals t
 

547
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,110
z plus nums k plus lumps u equals t
return true right it also works does it

548
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
return true right it also works does it
 

549
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,230
return true right it also works does it
make sense

550
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
make sense
 

551
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,630
make sense
and then in that case how many how many

552
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
and then in that case how many how many
 

553
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,550
and then in that case how many how many
fours so what's the common gravity

554
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
fours so what's the common gravity
 

555
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,829
fours so what's the common gravity
what what's the time complexity of this

556
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:26,839
what what's the time complexity of this
 

557
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:37,030
what what's the time complexity of this
one

558
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040

 

559
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,030

but this one is using the differences

560
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
but this one is using the differences
 

561
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,350
but this one is using the differences
here complexity

562
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
here complexity
 

563
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,190
here complexity
for this one it's a one because we're

564
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
for this one it's a one because we're
 

565
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,949
for this one it's a one because we're
not using any space this one is

566
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:44,959
not using any space this one is
 

567
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,870
not using any space this one is
om because we're using the recursion

568
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
om because we're using the recursion
 

569
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,870
om because we're using the recursion
yeah because you know you have the

570
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
yeah because you know you have the
 

571
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,310
yeah because you know you have the
left will be from zero to the n right

572
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
left will be from zero to the n right
 

573
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:01,829
left will be from zero to the n right
okay doesn't make sense eric yeah okay

574
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839

 

575
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,430

so what should we do at the beginning we

576
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
so what should we do at the beginning we
 

577
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,350
so what should we do at the beginning we
want to check if what

578
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
want to check if what
 

579
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:15,590
want to check if what
if what we already pick four numbers

580
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600

 

581
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,269

if we already pick four numbers we

582
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
if we already pick four numbers we
 

583
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,629
if we already pick four numbers we
should check what

584
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
should check what
 

585
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,790
should check what
we should check which which which

586
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
we should check which which which
 

587
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,990
we should check which which which
variable is

588
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
variable is
 

589
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:35,590
variable is
yellow written

590
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600

 

591
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,750

we pick four numbers

592
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760

 

593
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,389

yeah this is the same as if t equals

594
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
yeah this is the same as if t equals
 

595
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,470
yeah this is the same as if t equals
yellow return true ir split and false

596
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
yellow return true ir split and false
 

597
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,990
yellow return true ir split and false
yeah we can just put it in the same

598
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
yeah we can just put it in the same
 

599
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,829
yeah we can just put it in the same
thing all right okay you can do some

600
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:51,839
thing all right okay you can do some
 

601
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,310
thing all right okay you can do some
beatboxing

602
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320

 

603
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,120

okay that's it
