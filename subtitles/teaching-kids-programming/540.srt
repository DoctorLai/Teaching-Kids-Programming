1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,379
hello Mr Mr Rider right

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:11,700
okay so what's maze Amaze is a thing

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:15,619
where we're dead and the end

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,539
not like that okay let's say this is

5
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:21,119
the end okay and then it could be any

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,820
right there's only one part at least but

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,619
one pass okay or maybe not right okay so

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,340
maybe

9
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:33,840
so what is that okay so yeah I'm going

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,940
to draw a maze but yeah I can do it but

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,500
there's squares yeah then that's Square

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,079
I can do it so how do you do it

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,120
um there's no video you haven't finished

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,140
that yeah yeah let me try it and then

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,600
you understand what I meant okay okay

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,160
so amazed I understand the main the

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,960
normal maze is something like that right

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,860
so you have a different you know

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,860
different parts

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,860
that's just a picture look that's a

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,060
picture okay okay

22
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,560
another parrot

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,560
oh okay okay

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,680
this is amazing

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,400
like that that's a funny picture

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,680
like

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,680
panda

28
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:42,180
yeah I understand that but how does the

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,759
computer store the maze right so it's in

30
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,420
a great Elementary right I can draw a

31
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,259
mate here right for example like if I'm

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,780
saying right this is the entrance entry

33
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:58,680
the engine and axes are on the border

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,320
right so this could be uh exit and this

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,219
could be another exit and then I could

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,399
have uh you know a war right this is a

37
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,399
war

38
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,800
okay a war

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,379
okay so look this is the entrance right

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,140
if I'm saying this is the engine there

41
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:25,319
there are two exits okay so what's the

42
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,140
shortest what's the nearest exit what's

43
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,540
the nearest I think uh there is no

44
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,060
mirrors they're both the same the Bowser

45
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,120
Center one two three four

46
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,920
okay another two more to this two more

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,739
three yeah you're right and how about if

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,300
I rock it with the wall you can't even

49
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,060
go with that yeah you can't even go

50
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,580
there the nearest exit is this way right

51
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,900
I'm just too distract you yeah yeah okay

52
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:55,580
okay yeah but what if

53
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,580
yeah I know I know okay

54
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,900
what is

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,900
um

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,280
[Music]

57
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,200
then we need to return minus one why so

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,060
we're given this kind of maze we're

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,720
given this entrance which is on the

60
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,099
border one and we also given well we

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,560
don't know we need to find out we need

62
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:22,019
to find out the axis the X's are the

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,680
empty cells On the Border okay there is

64
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,720
no

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,239
language written minus one that's good

66
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,900
well if there is an exit

67
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,900
that is

68
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,900
actually do you get it yes

69
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,500
okay so what's your Source how do we

70
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,500
solve this problem

71
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,930
[Music]

72
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,120
that's a good thinking okay so how about

73
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,879
that massage can we use the deposition

74
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,739
really no reason why the professor she's

75
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,860
okay yeah it's good

76
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:58,560
we usually use the prefer search to find

77
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,299
the shortest path right level by level

78
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,340
you know I'm waiting Club okay we talk

79
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,739
about that right so we start from this

80
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,019
one when we start from this one and then

81
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,900
we do this level by level search as long

82
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:13,640
as we find the first exit which is on

83
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,739
the border a noun empty okay by the way

84
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,019
are you saying that we check in no no

85
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,239
that's a good point look we visualize

86
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,300
here we're at this point right we are at

87
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,800
this point which is the this step this

88
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,220
step one here

89
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,460
okay so that we expand what's the next

90
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,580
step here is two here three here is two

91
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,479
here three okay uh suppose to be here

92
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,060
and then what's next two two this the

93
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,580
next step of two is four all right

94
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,960
okay and then three in the next step is

95
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,780
five

96
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,540
we visualize the search we visualize the

97
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,400
path finding in a tree right in the tree

98
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,800
it's a search tree we visualize it and

99
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,380
we can do level by level right like now

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,860
this is six suppose we don't block it

101
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,020
okay we don't block it so seven

102
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,820
okay

103
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:11,880
9 10 11 12. okay so what's next look we

104
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,400
take three and a five

105
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,680
which one is no one you're not knowing

106
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,900
this one

107
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,580
this is what so one is what we don't

108
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,860
push it back to the queue all right with

109
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,440
the first thing first round remember so

110
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,960
look we take the four out

111
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,360
do we need to push two and three back

112
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,520
no because we have seen it we use the

113
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,759
headset right so now we take this out

114
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,340
for four hours and then uh and then

115
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,120
what's next in a Q5 right we take a five

116
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,639
out

117
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,199
what's the kit three and six plus three

118
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,020
we have seen this before so we put the

119
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,759
six what's the kit of six

120
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,300
seven right

121
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,960
what's the kid of seven and eleven all

122
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,880
right are you an 11. what's next eight

123
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,120
okay nine

124
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,919
when we see this nine right we find it

125
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,500
actually no actually we will take the

126
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,300
eleven out right let's watch his kid

127
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,520
seven and twelve but we've seen the

128
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,259
seven before so 12. what's the next to

129
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,960
take out nine

130
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,360
9 is the exit

131
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,259
then we find it so this is the shortest

132
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,120
right and when we expand the tree we

133
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,340
remember the distance

134
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,220
so when we push the kit back to the

135
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,500
queue we have this distance increment by

136
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,440
one all right

137
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,080
so perfect search and wait here we talk

138
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,740
about and waiting always it means that

139
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,020
the one step one step equals one it's

140
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,479
the same it's the same it goes to left

141
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,180
those the right goes to the up close the

142
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,680
bottom as long as empty cell right and

143
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,080
waited

144
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,639
and directly meaning that so we can go

145
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,560
to five five can double to three and we

146
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,440
need to solve this problem by using the

147
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,780
hash set am I right okay that's my

148
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,060
search my work or may not work because

149
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,460
that's my search we're just going deep

150
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,039
as as deep as we can and when we find

151
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,160
the first exit it may not be the nearest

152
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,979
make sense unless

153
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,660
unless we extort proof of us all the

154
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,900
paths and then we can find the nearest

155
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,479
path all right if we search if we find

156
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,400
all possibilities then we know which

157
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,319
path leads to the shortest but it's not

158
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,800
very efficient last week we talked about

159
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,500
minimum gene mutation and two

160
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,199
to find the nearest path we can also use

161
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,940
iterated dependencies right but in this

162
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,580
case prefer search is the way to go

163
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,860
right it's the way to go okay then let's

164
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,800
implement it and that's it so

165
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,960
we start with the engine right exit is

166
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,960
not the entry right we have to make sure

167
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,819
that the axis is not the same engine can

168
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,280
you tell me what are the other way of

169
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:52,199
doing it it's again the perfect search

170
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,690
but we can think of the opposite what's

171
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,170
the opposite

172
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,170
[Music]

173
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,580
yes but there could be many exit right

174
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,620
we can just push this axis into the

175
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,300
queue and then once he finds the engine

176
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,300
it's the same right it's both way right

177
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,919
yeah I'm right okay let's do one thing

178
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,979
at a time first of all we need to Define

179
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:18,300
this axis right it's exit

180
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:22,500
and we Define this R and see if if I

181
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:27,120
equal equals zero or C equals zero or r

182
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:31,379
equal rows minus one or c equal to a

183
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,380
column minus one right it's in here it's

184
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:38,159
in in the border right if it's in the

185
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,440
Border also we have to check the maze it

186
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,979
has to be a empty cell right empty cell

187
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,480
we can use the top okay empty set

188
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,560
otherwise we'll return first right this

189
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,920
is simple

190
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,580
simple function right the exit has to be

191
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,279
in the Border here here here here and it

192
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,500
has to be empty there no rewards we can

193
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,839
use the plus to represent Awards okay

194
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,740
this is the X equality and then we use

195
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:08,339
the Q Q equals c q

196
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:11,640
DQ EQ awakened Hybrid engine right

197
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,839
entrance so we push this entering and

198
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,820
train

199
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,720
and then at the beginning the step is

200
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:22,399
the yellow okay and then wire Q

201
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,779
of course we have to keep all the

202
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,240
visited cell in the scene hashtag

203
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,580
hashtag it's a notebook when we visit

204
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,760
the number seven we'll put it down so we

205
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,440
don't put this 75 in the queue okay one

206
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,560
question why do we need to remember the

207
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,860
the position we have seen so you don't

208
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,860
go back

209
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,899
you'll never

210
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,060
why is that look look one I push this

211
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:51,779
one I take it out I push it to two and

212
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:55,740
three back to the key okay so two

213
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:58,380
what's the kit one and four one and four

214
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,240
I push it one and four okay three take

215
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:04,320
it out what's the kick one four five

216
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,959
five one four five one what's the keep

217
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,800
two and three you see do you see the

218
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,839
problem

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,360
do you see the problem here

220
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,100
yeah we have seen this before and then

221
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,380
we keep pushing back to the kill and

222
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,640
that never ends so we need to have a

223
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:22,800
hatchback a notebook to remember the the

224
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,899
says the position we've seen okay yq we

225
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,740
take it out

226
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:33,300
ah C and the distance equals Q dot pop

227
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:35,519
left right here double ndq top left

228
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:39,899
foreign we take it out from the left

229
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,839
hand side okay if I see if not equals to

230
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,339
if it's not equal the entering we have

231
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,620
to compare to the entry if it's not

232
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,240
entering because the exit is not entered

233
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,480
right if the current position is not

234
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,420
entering and also it's an exit

235
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,880
right so we are basically saying that if

236
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,800
it's exit and it's also known the

237
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,519
entrance right we don't go back to the

238
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,760
engine

239
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,860
land will return the distance right

240
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,339
otherwise we go to the fourth Direction

241
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:11,519
Dr

242
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:14,360
PC in four Direction Four Direction up

243
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,220
down left right okay up down one zero

244
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,220
zero one

245
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,140
minus one zero zero minus one one zero

246
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,360
zero one minus one zero zero minus one

247
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:30,079
what are those

248
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,079
n r and C equals the t r plus r

249
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,160
and C right so okay I'm not going to

250
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,700
write it here two two squeeze it here

251
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,940
okay if n r n c is less than red

252
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:45,480
that easy to win the range and if it's

253
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,160
not seen before and I can see not insane

254
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,800
land

255
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:55,980
okay so if and R and c not in scene we

256
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,760
haven't visited this before and the N

257
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,279
are bigger than zero smaller than Rose

258
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,800
bigger than zero and

259
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:09,620
Zillow and C is smaller than columns

260
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,620
like we push it to the cube a pen

261
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,240
and then otherwise if we can find the

262
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,940
PATH using the blood pressure to return

263
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,660
minus one right you ask this question

264
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,300
this is to push the entrance to the kill

265
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:36,540
and what Eric you mentioned that we can

266
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:41,220
push back backwards we can push the exit

267
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:44,639
look around to exit so we go to La made

268
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:49,860
we find out the exit which are not the

269
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:52,260
entry okay and then we push all our exit

270
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,079
to the queue we initialize the Q here

271
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,899
this is to initialize the

272
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:58,980
kill when you start entering right so

273
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,160
only

274
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:06,120
opposite will be first of all go through

275
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,180
the maze find out or exit which you are

276
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,180
known as entering kill the append to to

277
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,420
push the exit to the kill and do this

278
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,639
then if RC is equal equal entry we just

279
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,920
need to check if it is entering we don't

280
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,839
need this right we don't need this you

281
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,160
want to find the path in the Maze you

282
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,680
can start with the engine or you can

283
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,880
start with the exit

284
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,540
but the thing is that there could be

285
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,220
many exit but that's okay for breakfast

286
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,579
we can push

287
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,920
all the axes to the cube so start with

288
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,120
all the exit right there could be many X

289
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,700
here

290
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,160
we see this engine we find the surface

291
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,880
path it's the same thing all right we

292
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,519
have to check if the next cell if the

293
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,880
next cell is empty it's not a wall then

294
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,740
we can push it back to the queue so here

295
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,740
what it's missing is that we have to

296
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,480
check if n

297
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,880
maze

298
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,940
n r and C

299
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,320
it's not a war right it's not a wall and

300
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,959
then we can push it back to the kill

301
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,899
okay the other thing about using this a

302
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,480
headset right it's not insane right so

303
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:18,360
we are marking down the cells the

304
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,760
positions that we have visited uh in a

305
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,639
queue right the other way of doing it is

306
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:27,300
that when we push it back to the queue

307
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:29,100
uh we directly change this the a cell

308
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,500
for example if it's an empty cell we

309
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,440
change this to wall right so we change

310
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:37,320
it to war then the next time with this

311
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,540
check same cell is not pushed back to

312
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,959
the queue again instead of using a scene

313
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:45,959
table headset to remember the fixes that

314
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,560
we have uh push we have visited we

315
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:53,579
directly change the maze yeah from empty

316
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,320
cell to wall so it's not being pushed

317
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:57,540
back again in the future so this is

318
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,660
another way okay so the time conducts

319
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,660
tea

320
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,779
this is textbook okay

321
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,760
okay so the next lesson we're going to

322
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,800
use the deficitors to prove us to see

323
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,380
just give an idea yeah just like last

324
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,660
time we have been talking about the mean

325
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,339
gym program the lesson after next we're

326
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,680
going to talk about the iterative

327
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:26,639
dependent session right so increment

328
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,560
increment the limit and into the default

329
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,600
okay what have you learned today it's

330
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:35,600
amazing more sentence you have a some

331
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,600
books

332
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:43,019
I don't want to find a shooting and I

333
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,579
haven't even breakfast search why can we

334
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,339
use the birth massage

335
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:49,860
because it's do you normally useful

336
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,800
finding the shortest path yeah because

337
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,260
we can visualize these in using the

338
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,260
graph it's a graph problem right it's a

339
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:00,300
shortage glass problem in uh weighted or

340
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,120
unweighted

341
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,579
waited on waited

342
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,620
okay is it directed

343
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:09,860
why is it directly just

344
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,860
just

345
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,579
and there's a star and and we don't want

346
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,639
to go back and and could be any

347
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:27,180
more of everything and so we want to

348
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,139
find the shortest of the shortest amount

349
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,800
of

350
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:33,779
um but

351
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,860
the closest exit then you're real estate

352
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:40,079
and then how do we solve this problem

353
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:43,459
okay and what other algorithm can we

354
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,540
apply to this problem

355
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:48,240
okay yeah

356
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,880
which one is the most efficient

357
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,899
purposes deficiency is inefficient right

358
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,899
just give you an idea

359
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,459
that's what TV
