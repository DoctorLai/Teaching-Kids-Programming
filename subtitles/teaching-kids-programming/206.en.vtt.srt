1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,509

what did we talk about yesterday

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
what did we talk about yesterday
 

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,390
what did we talk about yesterday
um what

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,400
um what
 

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,390
um what
something about the binary tree yeah

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
something about the binary tree yeah
 

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,670
something about the binary tree yeah
left bottom

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
left bottom
 

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,990
left bottom
finally three value right yeah

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
finally three value right yeah
 

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,830
finally three value right yeah
one two three to talk about the right

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
one two three to talk about the right
 

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,349
one two three to talk about the right
talk

14
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:27,359
talk
 

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,550
talk
okay so okay today

16
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
okay so okay today
 

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,670
okay so okay today
so we want to find out the first note

18
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
so we want to find out the first note
 

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,790
so we want to find out the first note
the left most note of the last row

20
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:36,800
the left most note of the last row
 

21
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,670
the left most note of the last row
okay yeah and yesterday we talked about

22
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
okay yeah and yesterday we talked about
 

23
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,630
okay yeah and yesterday we talked about
the pressure search

24
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
the pressure search
 

25
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,229
the pressure search
right left by level

26
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
right left by level
 

27
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,549
right left by level
and every time we expand the notes on

28
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
and every time we expand the notes on
 

29
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,069
and every time we expand the notes on
the next level we

30
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
the next level we
 

31
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,189
the next level we
store the answer as the first note all

32
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
store the answer as the first note all
 

33
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,830
store the answer as the first note all
right and when the breakfast search axis

34
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
right and when the breakfast search axis
 

35
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,950
right and when the breakfast search axis
the answer will be the first note

36
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
the answer will be the first note
 

37
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,349
the answer will be the first note
the left most note of the last row right

38
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
the left most note of the last row right
 

39
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,549
the left most note of the last row right
all right

40
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
all right
 

41
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,229
all right
yeah and today we're going to talk about

42
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
yeah and today we're going to talk about
 

43
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,469
yeah and today we're going to talk about
definition right

44
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
definition right
 

45
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,030
definition right
that's research so what's the idea about

46
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
that's research so what's the idea about
 

47
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,990
that's research so what's the idea about
that first search

48
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000

 

49
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,630

you can ideas how do we know how do we

50
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
you can ideas how do we know how do we
 

51
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,230
you can ideas how do we know how do we
how how does it work if we use the

52
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:16,240
how how does it work if we use the
 

53
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,230
how how does it work if we use the
deficit to solve this problem how does

54
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
deficit to solve this problem how does
 

55
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,350
deficit to solve this problem how does
it work

56
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
it work
 

57
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,310
it work
i think i think you go deeper as you can

58
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
i think i think you go deeper as you can
 

59
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,950
i think i think you go deeper as you can
so you go

60
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:22,960
so you go
 

61
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,469
so you go
to two and then yeah

62
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
to two and then yeah
 

63
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,789
to two and then yeah
so do we need kind of some kind of data

64
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
so do we need kind of some kind of data
 

65
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,069
so do we need kind of some kind of data
structure to store

66
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
structure to store
 

67
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,789
structure to store
what kind of data and then we can use it

68
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
what kind of data and then we can use it
 

69
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,149
what kind of data and then we can use it
later to get the

70
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
later to get the
 

71
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,749
later to get the
leftmost node of the level

72
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
leftmost node of the level
 

73
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,270
leftmost node of the level
the maximum level all right

74
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
the maximum level all right
 

75
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,109
the maximum level all right
yeah but we don't actually need to use

76
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
yeah but we don't actually need to use
 

77
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,550
yeah but we don't actually need to use
the step because we can use the

78
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
the step because we can use the
 

79
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,990
the step because we can use the
recursion right

80
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
recursion right
 

81
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,429
recursion right
right so here all right let's stop doing

82
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
right so here all right let's stop doing
 

83
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:49,990
right so here all right let's stop doing
that

84
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
that
 

85
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,950
that
so here all right what kind of data

86
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
so here all right what kind of data
 

87
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,990
so here all right what kind of data
structures do we need to

88
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
structures do we need to
 

89
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,190
structures do we need to
use to store the mapping the the level

90
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
use to store the mapping the the level
 

91
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,550
use to store the mapping the the level
we need uh to store the lever and

92
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
we need uh to store the lever and
 

93
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,670
we need uh to store the lever and
which that's most know right that's most

94
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
which that's most know right that's most
 

95
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,870
which that's most know right that's most
note

96
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
note
 

97
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,469
note
all right are we right

98
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
all right are we right
 

99
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,110
all right are we right
so here we can go as deep as you want

100
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
so here we can go as deep as you want
 

101
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,350
so here we can go as deep as you want
right as we want and then when we visit

102
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
right as we want and then when we visit
 

103
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,550
right as we want and then when we visit
each level

104
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
each level
 

105
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,390
each level
we check if a node

106
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
we check if a node
 

107
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,510
we check if a node
has been visited if this level has been

108
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
has been visited if this level has been
 

109
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:21,990
has been visited if this level has been
visited

110
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000

111
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,270
visited
or not right if we go to the left left

112
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
or not right if we go to the left left
 

113
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,550
or not right if we go to the left left
first but note eric diff

114

kind of
 

137
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,350
kind of
need to remember that if we have visited

138
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
need to remember that if we have visited
 

139
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,670
need to remember that if we have visited
the

140
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
the
 

141
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,589
the
level before right for example if we

level before right for example if we
 

143
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,949
level before right for example if we
visited one

144
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
visited one
 

145
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,390
visited one
have we reached level one yes no

146
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,400
have we reached level one yes no
 

147
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,910
have we reached level one yes no
no okay level zero have you reached the

148
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
no okay level zero have you reached the
 

149
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,430
no okay level zero have you reached the
level zero

150
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
level zero
 

151
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,670
level zero
no we haven't got anything in the what

152
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
no we haven't got anything in the what
 

153
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,990
no we haven't got anything in the what
kind of data structure then we put b

154
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,000
kind of data structure then we put b
 

155
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,350
kind of data structure then we put b
yes said or notebook map we put it

156
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
yes said or notebook map we put it
 

157
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,430
yes said or notebook map we put it
we can make it okay okay the level is

158
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
we can make it okay okay the level is
 

159
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,229
we can make it okay okay the level is
yellow we have a node one

160
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
yellow we have a node one
 

161
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,430
yellow we have a node one
okay then we go to what two right

162
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
okay then we go to what two right
 

163
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,789
okay then we go to what two right
yeah have we visited the level one

164
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
yeah have we visited the level one
 

165
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,949
yeah have we visited the level one
no we put out the level one to note the

166
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
no we put out the level one to note the
 

167
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,229
no we put out the level one to note the
two

168
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
two
 

169
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,589
two
okay and then what's next have we

170
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
okay and then what's next have we
 

171
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,229
okay and then what's next have we
visited

172
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
visited
 

173
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,390
visited
note any note in level one yeah

174
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
note any note in level one yeah
 

175
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,430
note any note in level one yeah
yeah so we don't stop with no update

176
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
yeah so we don't stop with no update
 

177
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,149
yeah so we don't stop with no update
have we visited the node in level two

178
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
have we visited the node in level two
 

179
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,990
have we visited the node in level two
no okay so we visited we said two equal

180
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
no okay so we visited we said two equal
 

181
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,949
no okay so we visited we said two equal
the node is have we visited the node in

182
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
the node is have we visited the node in
 

183
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,190
the node is have we visited the node in
number two

184
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
number two
 

185
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,949
number two
have we visited the node in red number

186
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:04,959
have we visited the node in red number
 

187
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,309
have we visited the node in red number
two yes

188
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
two yes
 

189
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,789
two yes
then we stopped okay now we have this

190
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
then we stopped okay now we have this
 

191
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,990
then we stopped okay now we have this
mapping

192
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
mapping
 

193
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,429
mapping
hash map level yellow the left most is

194
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
hash map level yellow the left most is
 

195
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,670
hash map level yellow the left most is
one level one and then most is two

196
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
one level one and then most is two
 

197
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,069
one level one and then most is two
number two the leftmost is four so what

198
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
number two the leftmost is four so what
 

199
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,830
number two the leftmost is four so what
should we do now

200
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
should we do now
 

201
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,790
should we do now
the last one why is the last one we find

202
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
the last one why is the last one we find
 

203
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,189
the last one why is the last one we find
out

204
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
out
 

205
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,310
out
that's the bottom

206
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
that's the bottom
 

207
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,780
that's the bottom
and then

208
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:32,790

 

209
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,110

[Music]

210
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
[Music]
 

211
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,270
[Music]
it has the largest key right largest

212
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
it has the largest key right largest
 

213
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,990
it has the largest key right largest
level and we find out the value

214
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
level and we find out the value
 

215
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,430
level and we find out the value
which has the largest key right yeah

216
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
which has the largest key right yeah
 

217
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,590
which has the largest key right yeah
yeah so what so this makes sense we use

218
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
yeah so what so this makes sense we use
 

219
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,749
yeah so what so this makes sense we use
the recursion visit the left node

220
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
the recursion visit the left node
 

221
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,070
the recursion visit the left node
uh the node the current node and then

222
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
uh the node the current node and then
 

223
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,670
uh the node the current node and then
the left node and then right now

224
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
the left node and then right now
 

225
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,390
the left node and then right now
that is the pre-order and let's

226
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
that is the pre-order and let's
 

227
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,990
that is the pre-order and let's
implement it in recursion

228
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
implement it in recursion
 

229
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,390
implement it in recursion
yeah which in which which uses the step

230
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
yeah which in which which uses the step
 

231
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,230
yeah which in which which uses the step
by default right location

232
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
by default right location
 

233
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,310
by default right location
and now we kind of need to use a hash

234
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
and now we kind of need to use a hash
 

235
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,909
and now we kind of need to use a hash
map to start the mapping

236
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
map to start the mapping
 

237
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,629
map to start the mapping
the keys are the levels the node the

238
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
the keys are the levels the node the
 

239
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,950
the keys are the levels the node the
value of the note of the left most

240
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
value of the note of the left most
 

241
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,909
value of the note of the left most
leftmost note and then at the other last

242
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
leftmost note and then at the other last
 

243
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,310
leftmost note and then at the other last
week

244
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
week
 

245
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,150
week
we need to find out the note

246
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
we need to find out the note
 

247
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,950
we need to find out the note
which has the largest key which will be

248
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
which has the largest key which will be
 

249
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,749
which has the largest key which will be
the left most note in the largest level

250
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
the left most note in the largest level
 

251
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,230
the left most note in the largest level
right

252
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
right
 

253
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,710
right
does it make it does it make sense yeah

254
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
does it make it does it make sense yeah
 

255
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,270
does it make it does it make sense yeah
okay

256
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
okay

do we have the left mouse node in uh
 

279
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,029
do we have the left mouse node in uh
now we return that or actually we don't

280
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
now we return that or actually we don't
 

281
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,309
now we return that or actually we don't
need to put alarm

load yes and then we need to also
need to pass which which thing which no

336
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
need to pass which which thing which no
 

337
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,830
need to pass which which thing which no
we uh what kind of information do we

338
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
we uh what kind of information do we
 

339
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,790
we uh what kind of information do we
need to pass

340
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
need to pass
 

341
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,189
need to pass
into it when we visit the left node left

342
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
into it when we visit the left node left
 

343
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,390
into it when we visit the left node left
right now

344
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
right now
 

345
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,510
right now
what are we trying to do here

346
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
what are we trying to do here
 

347
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,510
what are we trying to do here
the what what happened to the

348
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
the what what happened to the
 

349
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,430
the what what happened to the
if we go down to the left node what

350
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440
if we go down to the left node what
 

351
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,950
if we go down to the left node what
happened

352
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
happened
 

353
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,670
happened
yeah what happened if we go down the

354
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:39,680
yeah what happened if we go down the
 

355
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,029
yeah what happened if we go down the
level never know what happened

356
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
level never know what happened
 

357
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:55,749
level never know what happened
this is level zero what happened

358
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759

 

359
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,309

yeah we just we just return yeah we just

360
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
yeah we just we just return yeah we just
 

361
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,629
yeah we just we just return yeah we just
we can

362
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
we can
 

363
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,589
we can
okay then i even here i want to access

364
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
okay then i even here i want to access
 

365
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,670
okay then i even here i want to access
this so i need to put a landlord

366
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
this so i need to put a landlord
 

367
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,629
this so i need to put a landlord
keyword to say okay i want to visit i

368
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
keyword to say okay i want to visit i
 

369
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,390
keyword to say okay i want to visit i
want to update a value in here

370
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
want to update a value in here
 

371
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,430
want to update a value in here
data and then look

372
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
data and then look
 

373
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,510
data and then look
if i need to check in this level

374
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
if i need to check in this level
 

375
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,110
if i need to check in this level
okay so all right what do i need to

376
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
okay so all right what do i need to
 

377
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,550
okay so all right what do i need to
check i i know

378
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
check i i know
 

379
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,869
check i i know
this is level and then i want to check

380
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
this is level and then i want to check
 

381
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,029
this is level and then i want to check
if the level is in what in which one

382
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
if the level is in what in which one
 

383
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,189
if the level is in what in which one
each level has been visited right

384
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
each level has been visited right
 

385
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,829
each level has been visited right
so what should i do here

386
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839

 

387
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,829

yeah level in data if level

388
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
yeah level in data if level
 

389
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,030
yeah level in data if level
not in data if level not in data then

390
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
not in data if level not in data then
 

391
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,310
not in data if level not in data then
theta bracket

392
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
theta bracket
 

393
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,590
theta bracket
this is this is what square bracket

394
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
this is this is what square bracket
 

395
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,230
this is this is what square bracket
level

396
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240

 

397
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,949

yes the level so we have the mapping

398
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
yes the level so we have the mapping
 

399
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,190
yes the level so we have the mapping
level

400
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
level
 

401
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,870
level
level and the root

402
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
level and the root
 

403
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,389
level and the root
the note okay the root okay then now we

404
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
the note okay the root okay then now we
 

405
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,910
the note okay the root okay then now we
need to

406
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
need to
 

407
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,790
need to
visit the left or right first all right

408
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
visit the left or right first all right
 

409
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,949
visit the left or right first all right
therefore search one

410
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
therefore search one
 

411
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,550
therefore search one
and therefore search one yeah right

412
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
and therefore search one yeah right
 

413
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,030
and therefore search one yeah right
okay lose the left arrow and

414
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040

 

415
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,350

and then what's the second parameter

416
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360

 

417
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,030

we go down what happened level

418
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
we go down what happened level
 

419
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,630
we go down what happened level
level one plus one

420
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
level one plus one
 

421
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,990
level one plus one
and yeah

422
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000

 

423
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,310

yeah because we go to the left the level

424
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
yeah because we go to the left the level
 

425
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,670
yeah because we go to the left the level
class right we'll go to the right

426
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
class right we'll go to the right
 

427
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,190
class right we'll go to the right
level okay and then here we go to dfs

428
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
level okay and then here we go to dfs
 

429
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,590
level okay and then here we go to dfs
we call this function load

430
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600

 

431
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,070

yes and okay that's an interesting thing

432
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
yes and okay that's an interesting thing
 

433
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,829
yes and okay that's an interesting thing
after this bit the data is the

434
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839
after this bit the data is the
 

435
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,949
after this bit the data is the
dictionary

436
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
dictionary
 

437
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,350
dictionary
we have the keys and the values and we

438
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
we have the keys and the values and we
 

439
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,389
we have the keys and the values and we
know to

440
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
know to
 

441
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,230
know to
find out the keys what are the maximum

442
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
find out the keys what are the maximum
 

443
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,750
find out the keys what are the maximum
keys

444
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
keys
 

445
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,670
keys
return okay look at data

446
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
return okay look at data
 

447
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,710
return okay look at data
dot keys that's the key there

448
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
dot keys that's the key there
 

449
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,470
dot keys that's the key there
and if i put the maximum what does it

450
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
and if i put the maximum what does it
 

451
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,870
and if i put the maximum what does it
mean i got a maximum level right

452
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
mean i got a maximum level right
 

453
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,630
mean i got a maximum level right
all right maximum data keys is the list

454
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
all right maximum data keys is the list
 

455
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,870
all right maximum data keys is the list
of the keys so which will be zero one

456
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
of the keys so which will be zero one
 

457
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,150
of the keys so which will be zero one
two right all right

458
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
two right all right
 

459
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,550
two right all right
after this okay for example here

460
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
after this okay for example here
 

461
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,470
after this okay for example here
so what happened here what happened

462
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
so what happened here what happened
 

463
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,829
so what happened here what happened
after this can you

464
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
after this can you
 

465
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,910
after this can you
if this is the binary tree so what's in

466
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
if this is the binary tree so what's in
 

467
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,350
if this is the binary tree so what's in
data after this

468
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
data after this
 

469
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,470
data after this
at this point what's data in in here

470
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
at this point what's data in in here
 

471
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,750
at this point what's data in in here
can can you provide me uh data what's in

472
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
can can you provide me uh data what's in
 

473
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,949
can can you provide me uh data what's in
data

474
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
data
 

475

data
it's in the like level and okay 0

476
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
it's in the like level and okay 0
 

477
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,310
it's in the like level and okay 0
is one one one and then

478
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
is one one one and then
 

479
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,069
is one one one and then
one is two okay and then

480
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
one is two okay and then
 

481
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,350
one is two okay and then
two is four okay okay data

482
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
two is four okay okay data
 

483
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:07,269
two is four okay okay data
keys returns one we turn the last

484
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279

 

485
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,230

what are the keys of this one or this

486
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
what are the keys of this one or this
 

487
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,350
what are the keys of this one or this
one

488
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
one
 

489
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,350
one
what are keys key value which are the

490
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
what are keys key value which are the
 

491
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,710
what are keys key value which are the
keys

493
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,030

that's the value that's the key key

494
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
that's the value that's the key key
 

495
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,630
that's the value that's the key key
value pair so keys will be

496
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
value pair so keys will be
 

497
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,350
value pair so keys will be
zero one two like this yeah and maximum

498
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
zero one two like this yeah and maximum
 

499
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,829
zero one two like this yeah and maximum
returns

500
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
returns
 

501
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,150
returns
which one two okay and then

502
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
which one two okay and then
 

503
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,910
which one two okay and then
i want to get the two of the four how

504
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
i want to get the two of the four how
 

505
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,350
i want to get the two of the four how
can i write it

506
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360

 

507
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,069

no no no no this is the max this this

508
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
no no no no this is the max this this
 

509
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,030
no no no no this is the max this this
value is

510
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
value is
 

511
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,310
value is
max data keys so i want to reference the

512
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
max data keys so i want to reference the
 

513
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,190
max data keys so i want to reference the
value of these

514
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
value of these
 

515
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,150
value of these
so what should i do

516
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160

 

517
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,870

i can just do this data and then break

518
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
i can just do this data and then break
 

519
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,629
i can just do this data and then break
it remember that dictionary

520
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
it remember that dictionary
 

521
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,030
it remember that dictionary
the dictionary if additionally i can do

522
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
the dictionary if additionally i can do
 

523
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,470
the dictionary if additionally i can do
this theta

524
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
this theta
 

525
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,509
this theta
alright okay theta 1 equals 1 what's

526
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
alright okay theta 1 equals 1 what's
 

527
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,190
alright okay theta 1 equals 1 what's
theta 1

528
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
theta 1
 

529
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,629
theta 1
theta 1 e equals

530
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
theta 1 e equals
 

531
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,269
theta 1 e equals
2 2 yeah look this is the key and then

532
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
2 2 yeah look this is the key and then
 

533
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,870
2 2 yeah look this is the key and then
return the value that's the dictionary

534
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
return the value that's the dictionary
 

535
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,230
return the value that's the dictionary
okay that's the hashmap

536
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
okay that's the hashmap
 

537
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,710
okay that's the hashmap
okay we can just return this one yeah

538
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
okay we can just return this one yeah
 

539
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,590
okay we can just return this one yeah
return this one

540
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
return this one
 

541
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,990
return this one
and the value yeah if we if you want to

542
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
and the value yeah if we if you want to
 

543
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,150
and the value yeah if we if you want to
return the very top value if you want to

544
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
return the very top value if you want to
 

545
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,629
return the very top value if you want to
return a no you can just do it okay does

546
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
return a no you can just do it okay does
 

547
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,150
return a no you can just do it okay does
it make sense

548
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
it make sense
 

549
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,710
it make sense
yeah i'm going to erase something okay

550
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
yeah i'm going to erase something okay
 

551
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,990
yeah i'm going to erase something okay
no

552
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
no
 

553
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,110
no
okay i'm going to erase this thing what

554
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
okay i'm going to erase this thing what
 

555
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,030
okay i'm going to erase this thing what
what should i do here

556
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
what should i do here
 

557
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,949
what should i do here
okay what should i do here what should i

558
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
okay what should i do here what should i
 

559
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,629
okay what should i do here what should i
check if that no

560
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
check if that no
 

561
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,069
check if that no
if what if yeah

562
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079

 

563
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,069

you don't need to write so hard okay

564
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
you don't need to write so hard okay
 

565
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,060

it's okay it's both okay you can just
 

587
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,110
it's okay it's both okay you can just
write data okay a little bit no b

588
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
write data okay a little bit no b
 

589
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,190
write data okay a little bit no b
yeah okay what's the time complexity

yeah it's the same n is the number of
 

601
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,550
yeah it's the same n is the number of
nodes in the binary and then we are

602
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
nodes in the binary and then we are
 

603
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,110

00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
using
 

605
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,870
using
an additional uh data yeah hash map

yeah you see one level one note right so
 

627
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,189
yeah you see one level one note right so
in this case data will contain endnote
