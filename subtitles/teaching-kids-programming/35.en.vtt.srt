5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,630

so tell me what what is binary two

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
so tell me what what is binary two
 

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,550
so tell me what what is binary two
two okay so in particular what

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
two okay so in particular what
 

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,750
two okay so in particular what
what's two a number

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,760
what's two a number
 

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,669
what's two a number
so what's decimal you know the decimal

12
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
so what's decimal you know the decimal
 

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,430
so what's decimal you know the decimal
yeah decimal

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
yeah decimal
 

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,310
yeah decimal
it only has a point uh yeah that's one

16
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
it only has a point uh yeah that's one
 

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,069
it only has a point uh yeah that's one
meaning the other meaning is the blunder

18
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
meaning the other meaning is the blunder
 

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,750
meaning the other meaning is the blunder
we're using like one two three four

20
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
we're using like one two three four
 

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,030
we're using like one two three four
five six eight nine ten right how many

22
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
five six eight nine ten right how many
 

23
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,990
five six eight nine ten right how many
digits are there

24
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
digits are there
 

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,190
digits are there
one two how many digits how many types

26
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
one two how many digits how many types
 

27
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,069

from zero to nine
 

31
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,549
from zero to nine
nine ten yeah we got zero zero one two

32
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
nine ten yeah we got zero zero one two
 

33
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:05,670
nine ten yeah we got zero zero one two
yeah so zero one

34
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680

 

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,630

this one the numbers were daily used

36
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
this one the numbers were daily used
 

37
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,070

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,270
34 yeah yeah yeah is it
how many there are 10 digits yeah we

44
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
how many there are 10 digits yeah we
 

45
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,270
how many there are 10 digits yeah we
call it base 10

46
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
call it base 10
 

47
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,149
call it base 10
base 10 and also this is the one decimal

people on the world knows
 

87
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,749
people on the world knows
yeah it's international even africa

88
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
yeah it's international even africa
 

89
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,029
yeah it's international even africa
yeah yeah yeah so look africa

90
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
yeah yeah yeah so look africa
 

91
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,869
yeah yeah yeah so look africa
look let's talk about a little bit about

92
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
look let's talk about a little bit about
 

93
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,470
look let's talk about a little bit about
the number system we're using so

94
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
the number system we're using so
 

95
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,309
the number system we're using so
look at this one two three okay what

96
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
look at this one two three okay what
 

97
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,350
look at this one two three okay what
does it equal

98
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360

 

99
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,510

no no no this is one hundred and twenty

100
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
no no no this is one hundred and twenty
 

101
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,550
no no no this is one hundred and twenty
three yeah

102
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
three yeah
 

103
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,990
three yeah
this is 100 yeah yeah this is tens

104
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
this is 100 yeah yeah this is tens
 

105
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,350
this is 100 yeah yeah this is tens
yeah and this is once all right so these

106
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
yeah and this is once all right so these
 

107
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,270
yeah and this is once all right so these
equals to one times a hundred

108
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
equals to one times a hundred
 

109
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,390
equals to one times a hundred
plus two times ten plus three times one

110
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
plus two times ten plus three times one
 

111
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,350
plus two times ten plus three times one
right

112
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
right
 

113
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,790
right
yes so look this is 100 is 10 to the

114
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
yes so look this is 100 is 10 to the
 

115
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,910
yes so look this is 100 is 10 to the
power of 2 right

116
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
power of 2 right
 

117
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,630
power of 2 right
yeah this is 10 to the power 1 right

118
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
yeah this is 10 to the power 1 right
 

119
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,110
yeah this is 10 to the power 1 right
this is 10 to the power of zero right

120
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
this is 10 to the power of zero right
 

121
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,550
this is 10 to the power of zero right
yeah got it yeah okay so now i take

122
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
yeah got it yeah okay so now i take
 

123
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,150
yeah got it yeah okay so now i take
10 to the power of 3. the next one is 10

124
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
10 to the power of 3. the next one is 10
 

125
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,030
10 to the power of 3. the next one is 10
to the power 3 4 here then it'll be

126
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
to the power 3 4 here then it'll be
 

127
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,589
to the power 3 4 here then it'll be
4 times 10 to the power of 3 yeah so 4

128
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
4 times 10 to the power of 3 yeah so 4
 

129
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,869
4 times 10 to the power of 3 yeah so 4
1 120

130
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
1 120
 

131
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,790
1 120
23

132
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800

 

133
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,309

okay okay okay so now

134
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
okay okay okay so now
 

135
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,630
okay okay okay so now
it's the same the binary numbers how

136
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
it's the same the binary numbers how
 

137
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,710
it's the same the binary numbers how
many numbers are we how many digits are

138
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
many numbers are we how many digits are
 

139
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,030
many numbers are we how many digits are
we using

140
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
we using
 

141
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,589
we using
g two yes two because the decimal is ten

142
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
g two yes two because the decimal is ten
 

143
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,509
g two yes two because the decimal is ten
now we only two so what kind of digits

144
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
now we only two so what kind of digits
 

145
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,509
now we only two so what kind of digits
are we using

146
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
are we using
 

147
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,949
are we using
binary zero and one yeah we only have

148
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
binary zero and one yeah we only have
 

149
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,270
binary zero and one yeah we only have
two

150
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
two
 

151
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,910
two
possibilities zero and one yeah yeah so

152
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
possibilities zero and one yeah yeah so
 

153
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,589
possibilities zero and one yeah yeah so
why is why why this binaries

154
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
why is why why this binaries
 

155
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,550
why is why why this binaries
the computers are are very uh good at

156
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560
the computers are are very uh good at
 

157
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,270
the computers are are very uh good at
binaries

158
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
binaries
 

159
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,110
binaries
because we made a computer in such a way

160
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
because we made a computer in such a way
 

161
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,869
because we made a computer in such a way
that binaries are fundamental

162
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
that binaries are fundamental
 

163
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,949
that binaries are fundamental
because look computers are made of chips

164
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
because look computers are made of chips
 

165
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,350
because look computers are made of chips
yeah

166
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360

 

167
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:51,750

not wonderful

168
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760

 

169
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,869

so the chips so if you power on yeah

170
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
so the chips so if you power on yeah
 

171
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,949
so the chips so if you power on yeah
power on the next one if you power off

172
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
power on the next one if you power off
 

173
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,229
power on the next one if you power off
that's zero yeah

174
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
that's zero yeah
 

175
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,710
that's zero yeah
if you have a low power that's zero if

176
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
if you have a low power that's zero if
 

177
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,910
if you have a low power that's zero if
you have a high power

178
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
you have a high power
 

179
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,070
you have a high power
voltage yeah what is this one so it's

180
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
voltage yeah what is this one so it's
 

181
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,750
voltage yeah what is this one so it's
very computer is very good at this kind

182
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
very computer is very good at this kind
 

183
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,869
very computer is very good at this kind
of thing yeah

184
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
of thing yeah
 

185
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,589
of thing yeah
so the binary let's call it now we have

186
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
so the binary let's call it now we have
 

187
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,309
so the binary let's call it now we have
only one

188
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
only one
 

189
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,670
only one
zero one so so for example

190
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
zero one so so for example
 

191
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,990
zero one so so for example
uh if we uh look this is decimal the

192
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
uh if we uh look this is decimal the
 

193
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,590
uh if we uh look this is decimal the
specimen of the the numbers we're using

194
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
specimen of the the numbers we're using
 

195
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,469
specimen of the the numbers we're using
december yeah that's the final yeah okay

196
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
december yeah that's the final yeah okay
 

197
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,350
december yeah that's the final yeah okay
so look let's

198
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
so look let's
 

199
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,710
so look let's
zero one two three four

200
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
zero one two three four
 

201
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,749
zero one two three four
five let's check that a binary what's

202
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
five let's check that a binary what's
 

203
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,430
five let's check that a binary what's
this

204
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
this
 

205
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,950
this
one no binary yellow and then okay

206
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
one no binary yellow and then okay
 

207
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,110
one no binary yellow and then okay
yeah and two because we don't have two

208
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
yeah and two because we don't have two
 

209
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:55,430
yeah and two because we don't have two
we only have zero one

210
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440

 

211
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,110

we 9 and what's this 10 10 yeah

212
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
we 9 and what's this 10 10 yeah
 

213
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,590
we 9 and what's this 10 10 yeah
because we run out of digits so we we we

214
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
because we run out of digits so we we we
 

215
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,749
because we run out of digits so we we we
go back to the zero and but we we

216
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
go back to the zero and but we we
 

217
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,189
go back to the zero and but we we
carry over right

218
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199

 

219
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,990

well yes exactly okay so now what's next

220
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
well yes exactly okay so now what's next
 

221
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,230
well yes exactly okay so now what's next
three

222
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
three
 

223
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,430
three
eleven no okay seven what's next

224
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
eleven no okay seven what's next
 

225
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,870
eleven no okay seven what's next
twelve thirty one twenty

226
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
twelve thirty one twenty
 

227
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,430
twelve thirty one twenty
two there's no two oh yeah so what

228
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
two there's no two oh yeah so what
 

229
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,790
two there's no two oh yeah so what
what's the look what's this

230
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
what's the look what's this
 

231
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,830
what's the look what's this
look 99 you carry over

232
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
look 99 you carry over
 

233
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,430
look 99 you carry over
you curl it over 100 yeah so what's this

234
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
you curl it over 100 yeah so what's this
 

235
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,070
you curl it over 100 yeah so what's this
here

236
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
here
 

237
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,189
here
100. you put one it's carrying over

238
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
100. you put one it's carrying over
 

239
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,909
100. you put one it's carrying over
100 you see you see this and then there

240
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
100 you see you see this and then there
 

241
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,390
100 you see you see this and then there
was

242
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
was
 

243
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,990
was
101 one one ten one one

244
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
101 one one ten one one
 

245
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,110
101 one one ten one one
one and then one thousand you see so

246
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
one and then one thousand you see so
 

247
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,710
one and then one thousand you see so
these are corresponding to each other

248
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
these are corresponding to each other
 

249
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,350
these are corresponding to each other
yeah

250
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
yeah
 

251
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,550
yeah
one zero one one zero one

252
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
one zero one one zero one
 

253
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,590
one zero one one zero one
one one one okay that's it no more you

254
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
one one one okay that's it no more you
 

255
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,310
one one one okay that's it no more you
see

256
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
see
 

257
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,230
see
so look it's it's similar look

258
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
so look it's it's similar look
 

259
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,430
so look it's it's similar look
this is one but that is to be equal to

260
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
this is one but that is to be equal to
 

261
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,230
this is one but that is to be equal to
one to

262
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
one to
 

263
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,510
one to
times two to the power of three okay

264
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
times two to the power of three okay
 

265
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,309
times two to the power of three okay
you got it this one one so one one is

266
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
you got it this one one so one one is
 

267
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,909
you got it this one one so one one is
one to the power of two

268
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
one to the power of two
 

269
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,629
one to the power of two
plus one to the power of one plus one to

270
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
plus one to the power of one plus one to
 

271
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,830
plus one to the power of one plus one to
the power of zero

272
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
the power of zero
 

273
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,270
the power of zero
so that's what four plus two plus one

274
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
so that's what four plus two plus one
 

275
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,670
so that's what four plus two plus one
so it's seven you see is it

276
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680

 

277
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,150

so this is corresponding to each other

278
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
so this is corresponding to each other
 

279
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,510
so this is corresponding to each other
so how about this

280
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
so how about this
 

281
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,550
so how about this
four is one to the power of two you just

282
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
four is one to the power of two you just
 

283
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,909
four is one to the power of two you just
count how many digits

284
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919
count how many digits
 

285
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,510
count how many digits
on the right right and one and one

286
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520

 

287
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,590

okay so so now let's write a program to

288
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
okay so so now let's write a program to
 

289
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,710
okay so so now let's write a program to
convert these

290
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
convert these
 

291
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,430
convert these
into decimals if i tell you a number

292
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
into decimals if i tell you a number
 

293
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,870
into decimals if i tell you a number
like one one one one

294
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
like one one one one
 

295
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,830
like one one one one
tell me what's this what's this in

296
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
tell me what's this what's this in
 

297
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,469
tell me what's this what's this in
decimal one

298
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
decimal one
 

299
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,469
decimal one
thousand one hundred and eleven

300
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
thousand one hundred and eleven
 

301
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,670
thousand one hundred and eleven
so look this is this is what

302
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
so look this is this is what
 

303
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,070
so look this is this is what
one thousand two to the power of one two

304
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
one thousand two to the power of one two
 

305
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,430
one thousand two to the power of one two
three yeah

306
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
three yeah
 

307
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,210
three yeah
this is two to

308
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:01,220
this is two to
 

309
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,950
this is two to
[Applause]

310
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960

 

311
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,230

sorry because it's binary it's like

312
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
sorry because it's binary it's like
 

313
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,350
sorry because it's binary it's like
if sesame is ten right yeah okay if it's

314
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
if sesame is ten right yeah okay if it's
 

315
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,350
if sesame is ten right yeah okay if it's
specimen you'll be one ten to the power

316
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
specimen you'll be one ten to the power
 

317
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,990
specimen you'll be one ten to the power
3 plus

318
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
3 plus
 

319
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,830
3 plus
10 to the power of 2 plus 10 to the

320
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
10 to the power of 2 plus 10 to the
 

321
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,990
10 to the power of 2 plus 10 to the
power 1 plus 10 to the power 0. so

322
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
power 1 plus 10 to the power 0. so
 

323
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,070
power 1 plus 10 to the power 0. so
that's what a thousand

324
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080
that's what a thousand
 

325
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,909
that's what a thousand
a hundred ten one so it's a thousand

326
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
a hundred ten one so it's a thousand
 

327
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,950
a hundred ten one so it's a thousand
a hundred eleven yeah you see

328
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
a hundred eleven yeah you see
 

329
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,870
a hundred eleven yeah you see
yeah that's how we got intestinal but we

330
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:30,880
yeah that's how we got intestinal but we
 

331
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,510
yeah that's how we got intestinal but we
are now talking about binary so it's two

332
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
are now talking about binary so it's two
 

333
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,629
are now talking about binary so it's two
right base two eight plus

334
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
right base two eight plus
 

335
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,990
right base two eight plus
four four plus two and one

336
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
four four plus two and one
 

337
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,270
four four plus two and one
so that's what that is

338
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
so that's what that is
 

339
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,990
so that's what that is
15 15.

340
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000

 

341
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,990

okay so let's write a number and write a

342
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
okay so let's write a number and write a
 

343
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,029
okay so let's write a number and write a
program so let's

344
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
program so let's
 

345
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,029
program so let's
let's do this define the five binary two

346
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
let's do this define the five binary two
 

347
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:57,670
let's do this define the five binary two
decimal

348
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
decimal
 

349
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,820
decimal
right b

350
00:07:59,820 --> 00:07:59,830

[Music]
column okay so now we got the answer

354
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
column okay so now we got the answer
 

355
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,950
column okay so now we got the answer
yeah we're up with the ones

356
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
yeah we're up with the ones
 

357
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,309
yeah we're up with the ones
then we look in the video so for

358
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
then we look in the video so for
 

359
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,510
then we look in the video so for
i

360
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520

 

361
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,070

why are we using b for binary

362
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
why are we using b for binary
 

363
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,909
why are we using b for binary
look we can move this value so look look

364
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
look we can move this value so look look
 

365
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,469
look we can move this value so look look
we don't is one zero one one zero okay

366
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
we don't is one zero one one zero okay
 

367
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,070
we don't is one zero one one zero okay
this is binary right

368
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
this is binary right
 

369
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,309
this is binary right
first of all we got this one right so we

370
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
first of all we got this one right so we
 

371
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,189
first of all we got this one right so we
need to come

372
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
need to come
 

373
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,630
need to come
times itself by two first and plus this

374
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
times itself by two first and plus this
 

375
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,790
times itself by two first and plus this
one value so we call it uh we

376
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
one value so we call it uh we
 

377
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,469
one value so we call it uh we
convert it to uh integer

378
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
convert it to uh integer
 

379
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,750
convert it to uh integer
okay and then that's it and then return

380
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
okay and then that's it and then return
 

381
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,829
okay and then that's it and then return
answer that's it

382
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
answer that's it
 

383
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,829
answer that's it
that quick yes

384
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839

 

385
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,949

yeah yeah yeah bye-bye oh yeah yeah

386
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
yeah yeah yeah bye-bye oh yeah yeah
 

387
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,190
yeah yeah yeah bye-bye oh yeah yeah
so look listen

388
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200

 

389
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,350

now we are here yeah so now the value is

390
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
now we are here yeah so now the value is
 

391
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,790
now we are here yeah so now the value is
one right five

392
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
one right five
 

393
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,949
one right five
and then if i move here the value will

394
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
and then if i move here the value will
 

395
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,150
and then if i move here the value will
be one

396
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
be one
 

397
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,470
be one
times two that would be two yeah two

398
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
times two that would be two yeah two
 

399
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,550
times two that would be two yeah two
plus zero

400
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
plus zero
 

401
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,949
plus zero
yeah because look at 110 is two right

402
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
yeah because look at 110 is two right
 

403
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,430
yeah because look at 110 is two right
and then if i move here is two times two

404
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
and then if i move here is two times two
 

405
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,550
and then if i move here is two times two
equals four

406
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
equals four
 

407
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,670
equals four
this one plus one is five right

408
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
this one plus one is five right
 

409
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,070
this one plus one is five right
plus one that's five and then if i move

410
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
plus one that's five and then if i move
 

411
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,190
plus one that's five and then if i move
again

412
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
again
 

413
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,230
again
now five times two equals ten you see so

414
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
now five times two equals ten you see so
 

415
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,190
now five times two equals ten you see so
that's two

416
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
that's two
 

417
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,990
that's two
that's eight times eight plus two that's

418
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
that's eight times eight plus two that's
 

419
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,310
that's eight times eight plus two that's
ten

420
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
ten
 

421
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,470
ten
yeah so every time look if it is the

422
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
yeah so every time look if it is the
 

423
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,150
yeah so every time look if it is the
decimal if it is rotation

424
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
decimal if it is rotation
 

425
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,030
decimal if it is rotation
one two three yeah if i put a zero at

426
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
one two three yeah if i put a zero at
 

427
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,829
one two three yeah if i put a zero at
the end

428
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
the end
 

429
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,870
the end
it's the least value times 10 right my

430
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
it's the least value times 10 right my
 

431
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,990
it's the least value times 10 right my
yeah so i i put this value shift the

432
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
yeah so i i put this value shift the
 

433
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,910
yeah so i i put this value shift the
value to one position to the left and i

434
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
value to one position to the left and i
 

435
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,190
value to one position to the left and i
put a zero here and

436
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,200
put a zero here and
 

437
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,590
put a zero here and
this entire value is times ten it's the

438
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
this entire value is times ten it's the
 

439
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,310
this entire value is times ten it's the
same here

440
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
same here
 

441
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,710
same here
this entire value is times two if i move

442
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
this entire value is times two if i move
 

443
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,910
this entire value is times two if i move
i put something on

444
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
i put something on
 

445
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,870
i put something on
only right over zero but it could be one

446
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
only right over zero but it could be one
 

447
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,070
only right over zero but it could be one
and i put a

448
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
and i put a
 

449
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,150
and i put a
then this is the thing is i move one

450
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
then this is the thing is i move one
 

451
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,150
then this is the thing is i move one
position to the left and plus the least

452
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
position to the left and plus the least
 

453
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,110
position to the left and plus the least
current digit

454
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
current digit
 

455
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,230
current digit
and this is the final value yeah got it

456
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
and this is the final value yeah got it
 

457
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,150
and this is the final value yeah got it
okay how about the other way from

458
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
okay how about the other way from
 

459
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,550
okay how about the other way from
decimal to the finale

460
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560

 

461
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,710

so let's take a look at the decimal how

462
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
so let's take a look at the decimal how
 

463
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,430
so let's take a look at the decimal how
we get it okay

464
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
we get it okay
 

465
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,829
we get it okay
look one two three how can we get this

466
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
look one two three how can we get this
 

467
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,580
look one two three how can we get this
number one percent

468
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:19,590
number one percent
 

469
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,550
number one percent
[Music]

470
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560

 

471
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,509

you're making me noise busy okay look at

472
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
you're making me noise busy okay look at
 

473
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,190
you're making me noise busy okay look at
one two three divided by

474
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,200
one two three divided by
 

475
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,750
one two three divided by
ten let's divide it by ten that's easy

476
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
ten let's divide it by ten that's easy
 

477
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,550
ten let's divide it by ten that's easy
remaining three okay and then 12 divided

478
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
remaining three okay and then 12 divided
 

479
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,829
remaining three okay and then 12 divided
by 10

480
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
by 10
 

481
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,870
by 10
one remaining two right yeah divided by

482
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
one remaining two right yeah divided by
 

483
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,670
one remaining two right yeah divided by
ten

484
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
ten
 

485
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,750
ten
zero remaining one yeah once it's zero

486
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
zero remaining one yeah once it's zero
 

487
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,670
zero remaining one yeah once it's zero
now look we have one two three we get a

488
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
now look we have one two three we get a
 

489
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,230
now look we have one two three we get a
very one

490
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
very one
 

491
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,829
very one
so we'll write it this way one two three

492
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
so we'll write it this way one two three
 

493
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,829
so we'll write it this way one two three
yeah yeah

494

dividing by two one remaining one right
 

515
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,350
dividing by two one remaining one right
dividing by two zero remaining one so

516
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
dividing by two zero remaining one so
 

517
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,350
dividing by two zero remaining one so
what's the answer

518
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
what's the answer
 

519
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,110
what's the answer
uh one more one yes you see ryan

got this okay look at it okay so can you

522
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
got this okay look at it okay so can you
 

523
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,310
got this okay look at it okay so can you
tell me what's the 14 in binary and

524
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
tell me what's the 14 in binary and
 

525
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,030
tell me what's the 14 in binary and
that's it

526
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
that's it
 

527
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,069
that's it
fourteen finally finally equals one

528
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
fourteen finally finally equals one
 

529
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,350
fourteen finally finally equals one
right here

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,150

how about okay so that's one one

538
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
how about okay so that's one one
 

539
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,750
how about okay so that's one one
one zero what's this impact in decimal

540
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
one zero what's this impact in decimal
 

541
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,550
one zero what's this impact in decimal
what equals what in decimal and then the

542
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
what equals what in decimal and then the
 

543
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,110
what equals what in decimal and then the
other way

544
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
other way
 

545
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,790
other way
is 14 in decimal equals

546
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
is 14 in decimal equals
 

547
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,750
is 14 in decimal equals
how many in binary okay so this can you

548
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
how many in binary okay so this can you
 

549
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,790
how many in binary okay so this can you
do it one is

550
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
do it one is
 

551
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,750
do it one is
can you pick one and do it

552
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760

 

553
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,110

can you guess is that binary

554
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
can you guess is that binary
 

555
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:32,790
can you guess is that binary
no no just listen

556
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800

 

557
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,990

14 in decimal is how many in binary is

558
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
14 in decimal is how many in binary is
 

559
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,150
14 in decimal is how many in binary is
only one and zero remember yeah

560
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
only one and zero remember yeah
 

561
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,350
only one and zero remember yeah
remember what did i just tell you that

562
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
remember what did i just tell you that
 

563
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,150
remember what did i just tell you that
uh

564
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
uh
 

565
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,550
uh
one ten ten in binary equals

566
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
one ten ten in binary equals
 

567
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,750
one ten ten in binary equals
so we need to divide fourteen yeah by

568
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
so we need to divide fourteen yeah by
 

569
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,470
so we need to divide fourteen yeah by
ten

570
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
ten
 

571
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,470
ten
yeah yeah that's one remaining

572
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
yeah yeah that's one remaining
 

573
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,829
yeah yeah that's one remaining
four no no not divided by

574
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
four no no not divided by
 

575
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,470
four no no not divided by
ten divided by two right remember we are

576
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
ten divided by two right remember we are
 

577
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,470
ten divided by two right remember we are
converting to the binary

578
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
converting to the binary
 

579
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,590
converting to the binary
seven remaining one

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
seven remaining one
 

581
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,790
seven remaining one
okay then seven divided by two

582
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
okay then seven divided by two
 

583
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,509
okay then seven divided by two
three remaining one and divided by two

584
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519

binary equals one fourteen yes see

596
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
binary equals one fourteen yes see
 

597
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,590
binary equals one fourteen yes see
these two numbers are equal you see and

598
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
these two numbers are equal you see and
 

599
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,750
these two numbers are equal you see and
how can we get at least

600
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
how can we get at least
 

601
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,550
how can we get at least
this 2 to the power 3 plus 2 to the

602
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
this 2 to the power 3 plus 2 to the
 

603
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,269
this 2 to the power 3 plus 2 to the
power of 2

604
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
power of 2
 

605
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,790
power of 2
plus 2 to the power of 1 okay plus 0.
