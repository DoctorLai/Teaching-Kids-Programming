1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
oh hello hello hello hello

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,720
all right yeah

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,720
what's graph we talk about graph all the

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,240
time what's graph

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,400
a graph is a graph

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,120
a graph is a graph yes but it's a

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,120
collection of

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,439
okay so if there are two trees what do

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,160
we call it

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,719
forest yeah it's also yes

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,680
a tree is a connected come on come on a

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,760
tree

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,640
it's a connected a single component

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,640
connected no cycles yeah no cycles

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,640
circles

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,360
another concept simple what's single

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,920
graph

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,440
simple graph is that okay so you can you

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
can't have these

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,680
these

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,199
you can have two edges between two

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,160
right yes

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,440
yeah that yeah this is not a simple car

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,000
okay

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,560
okay it looks like a car

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,040
yeah i i don't i okay now it looks like

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,799
this is this is my simple car this is

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,400
this is okay

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,320
this is a single class okay it looks

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,040
like a rainforest

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,000
it looks like an unicycle

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,200
okay so but you know the trees come on

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,560
you know the trees are directed t-a-g

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,600
eng

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,960
this is a few concepts we need to lag

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,720
what's the energy

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,000
dng is direct cyclic graph okay so it

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,880
has direction yes direction and a cyclic

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,399
means there's no cycles

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,640
okay so let's say

41
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,640
hey

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,920
okay so this is a graph okay this is

43
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,799
a means you need to play piano okay

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,920
is like you can play games yay

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,840
okay

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,319
and then t is like you need to go to

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,840
sleep okay oh

48
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,560
oh just read my part of it okay

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,120
so

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,640
how many tasks do we do you need to have

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,360
to do first

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,160
before you go to visit all the notes in

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,120
the graph you have to do piano

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,440
work and and and

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,000
combo first oh yeah so so at the

56
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,560
beginning

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,800
yeah okay so look in order to visit all

58
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,480
the notes in the graph we have to visit

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
a and see these two can be done in

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,239
parallel yeah playing piano i'm doing

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,840
homework okay

62
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,120
okay so in we call this kind of

63
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,280
tremendous

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,080
graph we call it topology you know

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,800
what's topology topology is topology

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,800
topology

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,360
this has this can be visualized as

68
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,840
dependency in order to do the b you have

69
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,760
to do the a and c first yeah a and c are

70
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,879
independent you cannot do it in parallel

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,400
right okay so today's task very simple

72
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,360
given this graph

73
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,080
given the graph with directions

74
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,599
find out the number of the nodes we have

75
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
to weaken

76
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,159
uh minimum number of nodes we have to

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,920
visit in order to visit all the nodes in

78
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,400
the in in the graph

79
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,480
make sense for example the a and c this

80
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,000
is the minimum number of nodes we can

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,840
start doing

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,319
in order to finish or

83
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,480
visiting all the other nodes right

84
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,680
yeah

85
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,000
am i clear

86
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,360
am i clear yeah so for example another

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,720
one

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,720
another one you tell me okay

89
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,040
okay this is a bit tricky

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,840
this is a bit tricky okay uh

91
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,840
is it or is

92
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,680
it okay so look he has a cycle yeah or

93
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,680
maybe here here's a cycle okay

94
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,560
wow

95
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
well this is a bit trickier

96
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,840
well d obviously we need to store it

97
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,400
first but how about this a b c look in

98
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,639
order to a you need to finish c right

99
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,479
but in order to finish it you need to

100
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,639
finish b so there's a cycle right you

101
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,120
can't do anything yeah yeah that's a

102
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,600
good question okay so let's just do

103
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
piano you can play games

104
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,199
play again you could do

105
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,960
how you work and then you have to

106
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,840
oh okay

107
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,479
what

108
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,199
top logic

109
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,759
okay look at this there's a cycle yeah

110
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,560
it's cycle look this is a cycle a

111
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,240
triangle a triangle

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,199
a b c

113
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,240
in order to do b you need to finish a in

114
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,080
order to do c you need to finish b okay

115
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
in order to yeah this is a cycle so you

116
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,919
can't finish it right okay so let's

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,440
assume there's no cycle

118
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,440
let's not assume let's see

119
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,360
[Music]

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,360
okay how about this

121
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,759
yeah

122
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,840
okay so we can we can start with steve

123
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,960
that's the minimum number of the notes

124
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,000
you can start at first okay

125
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,759
[Music]

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,800
go to sleep play piano play games no no

127
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,680
this is different different ones

128
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
at the end yeah yeah

129
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,080
what's your idea looking at the graph

130
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,880
what's our approach to to find a note

131
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,120
that we we can start at first

132
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,530
the thing is um

133
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,680
it's it's

134
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,639
[Music]

135
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,560
it's um we need to check one

136
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,160
we need to check if it's

137
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,400
if you if

138
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,639
if um if like if something

139
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,240
points to it yeah exactly something

140
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
points to it you bring a very good

141
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,120
concept what's what do we call it

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,400
something points to it uh

143
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,440
in

144
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,160
degree

145
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,280
okay we have two characters in

146
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,479
okay in yeah this is in

147
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,280
this is out okay make sense yeah

148
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,440
going out of the edge is go up

149
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,120
degree means the number yeah how many

150
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,199
look we can count

151
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,319
how many look at this b how many edges

152
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,319
coming to it going into it i think so

153
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,759
the in degree is two how many edges

154
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,039
coming out of b one right so our big q

155
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,199
is one right yeah so we just have to

156
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,039
collect all the nodes which has the in

157
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,039
degree equals to what

158
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,800
if it has in degree zero that's the way

159
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,360
that let's say if we in degree is zero

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,560
then let's know we can start right make

161
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,960
sense

162
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,400
look integral is zero in degrees

163
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,599
in degree two

164
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,560
in degree

165
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,960
what

166
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,039
d the in degree in degree d is one

167
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,520
what's the articulator b

168
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,560
one what's our degree of d

169
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,720
zero what's out including a and z

170
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,720
uh

171
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,199
good job okay that's it for today easy

172
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,039
let's try the kill and then i'll be

173
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,880
saying

174
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,199
that's it for the day let's just write

175
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,759
okay and that'll be it

176
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,759
in degree

177
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,160
okay that's very very important concept

178
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,039
of topology

179
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,039
topology um

180
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,359
[Music]

181
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,479
note okay

182
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,879
now we have given uh

183
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,039
what let's get edges okay let's given

184
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,199
the edges i know

185
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,759
address a to b okay let's put all the

186
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,759
notes in the set right let's say notes

187
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,400
equals a set

188
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:26,560
all right and we just need to go

189
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:29,360
from a to b edges from a to b in edges

190
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,319
then now stop

191
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,800
at

192
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,080
we're adding this node a and then we

193
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,080
also need to do as well

194
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,680
we add a we also need to add a b

195
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:43,360
[Music]

196
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,160
okay and then look so okay so we have uh

197
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,959
we need to have a data structure to

198
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,000
store the number of to to count how many

199
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,120
edges pointing in yeah yeah okay so

200
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,399
let's say g equals before this generally

201
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,680
all right

202
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,680
what's before dictionary

203
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,959
okay

204
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,600
the type of default is e zero in okay so

205
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,600
then g

206
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,839
now we go through the all the nodes here

207
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,000
and in

208
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,360
nodes this is all or not and what should

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,600
we do with that we how do we check if if

210
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,600
g

211
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,880
and then we can answer yeah

212
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,880
what's the times complexity

213
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,279
the number of edges let's say n okay

214
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,320
n is the number of edges

215
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,360
go through the edges oh n yeah what's

216
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,360
the space from let's see

217
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,600
huh

218
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,760
what's the space complexity yeah g and

219
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
no

220
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,360
yeah make sense

221
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,760
okay okay let's say for today good job

222
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,040
it's quite easy today yeah isn't it

223
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,040
this topology uh

224
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,959
topology yeah

225
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,040
is that we given the graph with

226
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,880
dependency with the

227
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:39,040
directions it mainly refers to the dag

228
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,440
directive yeah a pointed to b means that

229
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,360
in order to finish b to complete b you

230
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,600
have to do a first yeah

231
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
but yeah for example the task

232
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,360
finish homework

233
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,600
and playing games right

234
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
and then we today we talk about the in

235
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,399
degree or degree in degrees the number

236
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,880
of edges pointing to that vertex all

237
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,040
degrees number of edges going out of the

238
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,959
degree okay i know what we're doing what

239
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,360
we're doing here like we do first of all

240
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,440
we calculate this in degree and then we

241
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,200
just append the notes with integra

242
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,600
equals zero means that there's no task

243
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,760
depending on that vertex right yeah

244
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,760
simpler right that's it for today bye
