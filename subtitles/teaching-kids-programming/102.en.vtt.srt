00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,120
today good good
 

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,310
today good good
good good so today we'll talk about

6
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,320
good good so today we'll talk about
 

7
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,629
good good so today we'll talk about
one problem which is called the longest

8
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
one problem which is called the longest
 

9
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,190
one problem which is called the longest
pending drum subsequences

10
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
pending drum subsequences
 

11
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,330
pending drum subsequences
long piece

12
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:19,340

 

13
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:50,790

[Music]

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800

 

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,990

okay so what's the subsequence that is

16
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
okay so what's the subsequence that is
 

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,830
okay so what's the subsequence that is
another parameter what's substance

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840
another parameter what's substance
 

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,470
another parameter what's substance
is in the sequence that can be

20
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
is in the sequence that can be
 

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,510
is in the sequence that can be
divided from another sequence by

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
divided from another sequence by
 

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,310
divided from another sequence by
deleting

24
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
deleting
 

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,469
deleting
some unknown yeah that's what they're

26
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
some unknown yeah that's what they're
 

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,469
some unknown yeah that's what they're
using changing the order of

28
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
using changing the order of
 

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,429
using changing the order of
the remaining elements whatever okay so

30
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
the remaining elements whatever okay so
 

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:11,830
the remaining elements whatever okay so
a b

32
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
a b
 

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,149
a b
c d is a substance you can delete any of

34
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:14,159
c d is a substance you can delete any of
 

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,749
c d is a substance you can delete any of
them so it could be a

36
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
them so it could be a
 

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,710
them so it could be a
c e yeah you can delete b and d or you

38
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
c e yeah you can delete b and d or you
 

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,590
c e yeah you can delete b and d or you
can do it

40
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
can do it
 

41
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,749
can do it
b c d then you become a basically you

42
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
b c d then you become a basically you
 

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,590
b c d then you become a basically you
can delete now

44
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
can delete now
 

45
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,910
can delete now
when you divide now is a b c d or you

46
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
when you divide now is a b c d or you
 

47
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,350
when you divide now is a b c d or you
did it

48
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
did it
 

49
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,469
did it
one or more yeah you can do one of them

50
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
one or more yeah you can do one of them
 

51
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,670
one or more yeah you can do one of them
it will be a c d e or a a

52
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
it will be a c d e or a a
 

53
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,390
it will be a c d e or a a
d yeah do you get it but the others do

54
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
d yeah do you get it but the others do
 

55
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,510
d yeah do you get it but the others do
not change

56
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
not change
 

57
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,789
not change
yes so basically you can erase

58
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
yes so basically you can erase
 

59
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,830
yes so basically you can erase
any characters okay yeah

60
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,840
any characters okay yeah
 

61
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,069
any characters okay yeah
okay so the longest subject is a

62
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
okay so the longest subject is a
 

63
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,990
okay so the longest subject is a
subsequence for example like

64
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
subsequence for example like
 

65
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,109
subsequence for example like
b b b a b b

66
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
b b b a b b
 

67
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,310
b b b a b b
b so

68
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320

 

69
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,149

you can delete the a then it becomes the

70
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
you can delete the a then it becomes the
 

71
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,149
you can delete the a then it becomes the
longest subsequent which is bbb

72
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
longest subsequent which is bbb
 

73
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,749
longest subsequent which is bbb
and then you should give me the answer

74
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
and then you should give me the answer
 

75
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,910
and then you should give me the answer
for because you can find the longest

76
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
for because you can find the longest
 

77
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,309
for because you can find the longest
paragraph of subsequent is four and

78
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
paragraph of subsequent is four and
 

79
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,830
paragraph of subsequent is four and
another one c b b a

80
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
another one c b b a
 

81
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,710
another one c b b a
b b b yes well done so it's two right

82
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
b b b yes well done so it's two right
 

83
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,589
b b b yes well done so it's two right
you can do this c

84
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
you can do this c
 

85
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,630
you can do this c
and a yes yeah

86
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
and a yes yeah
 

87
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,949
and a yes yeah
so how to how do we achieve this problem

88
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
so how to how do we achieve this problem
 

89
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,110
so how to how do we achieve this problem
like for example like

90
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
like for example like
 

91
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,229
like for example like
a b b a c d d

92
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
a b b a c d d
 

93
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,270
a b b a c d d
e okay so forgiveness

94
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
e okay so forgiveness
 

95
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,990
e okay so forgiveness
how do we what's the approach to find

96
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
how do we what's the approach to find
 

97
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,509
how do we what's the approach to find
the longest subsequence

98
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
the longest subsequence
 

99
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:44,470
the longest subsequence
any idea you

100
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480

 

101
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,430

yeah and any other one because you can't

102
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
yeah and any other one because you can't
 

103
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,750
yeah and any other one because you can't
have

104
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
have
 

105
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,350
have
eu right because there's no uh reality

106
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
eu right because there's no uh reality
 

107
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,550
eu right because there's no uh reality
so you need the

108
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
so you need the
 

109
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,990
so you need the
two e's dd yeah c

110
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
two e's dd yeah c
 

111
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,670
two e's dd yeah c
d d b v c d d

112
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
d d b v c d d
 

113
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,710
d d b v c d d
b b c d d

114
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
b b c d d
 

115
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,270
b b c d d
c d d where down yeah that's five we're

116
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
c d d where down yeah that's five we're
 

117
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,990
c d d where down yeah that's five we're
done we're done

118
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
done we're done
 

119
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,190
done we're done
that's good so five so when when you

120
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
that's good so five so when when you
 

121
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,670
that's good so five so when when you
have no

122
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
have no
 

123
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,030
have no
do you have any other approach

124
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040

 

125
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,190

if you don't you can always start with

126
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
if you don't you can always start with
 

127
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,869
if you don't you can always start with
one approach

128
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
one approach
 

129
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,229
one approach
which is what blue force you know

130
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
which is what blue force you know
 

131
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,830
which is what blue force you know
first brute force

132
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
first brute force
 

133
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,750
first brute force
so what's blue force blue force is try

134
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
so what's blue force blue force is try
 

135
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,670
so what's blue force blue force is try
natively try naively as many pos

136
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
natively try naively as many pos
 

137
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,070
natively try naively as many pos
try try as all the possibilities

138
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
try try as all the possibilities
 

139
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,030
try try as all the possibilities
and then check each one yeah take a long

140
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
and then check each one yeah take a long
 

141
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,990
and then check each one yeah take a long
time yeah yeah let's

142
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
time yeah yeah let's
 

143
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,869
time yeah yeah let's
prove us brute force blue force approach

144
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
prove us brute force blue force approach
 

145
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,990
prove us brute force blue force approach
is very

146
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
is very
 

147
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,630
is very
intuitive right you can think of any you

148
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
intuitive right you can think of any you
 

149
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,190
intuitive right you can think of any you
can

150
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
can
 

151
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,509
can
the first approach to solve any problem

152
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
the first approach to solve any problem
 

153
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,470
the first approach to solve any problem
should be

154
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
should be
 

155
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,030
should be
performance then we analyze how complex

156
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
performance then we analyze how complex
 

157
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,830
performance then we analyze how complex
will be so

158
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
will be so
 

159
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,869
will be so
basically we can prove first we can find

160
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
basically we can prove first we can find
 

161
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,990
basically we can prove first we can find
or if if we know how to find all the

162
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
or if if we know how to find all the
 

163
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,869
or if if we know how to find all the
subsequence

164
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
subsequence
 

165
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,149
subsequence
yeah if we can find all the subsequence

166
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
yeah if we can find all the subsequence
 

167
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,309
yeah if we can find all the subsequence
and then we check if each subsequence is

168
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
and then we check if each subsequence is
 

169
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,910
and then we check if each subsequence is
a pending term right

170

183
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,830
to find gimme hop if it's a paragraph
do you still remember how we're checking

184
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840
do you still remember how we're checking
 

185
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,469
do you still remember how we're checking
it yeah

00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
planned on
 

211
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,110
planned on
simple yeah so we have two pointers

212
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
simple yeah so we have two pointers
 

213
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,870
simple yeah so we have two pointers
moving towards each other when i meet in

214
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
moving towards each other when i meet in
 

215
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,590
moving towards each other when i meet in
the middle

216
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
the middle
 

217
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,790
the middle
then it's a pairing zone okay so let's

218
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
then it's a pairing zone okay so let's
 

219
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,029
then it's a pairing zone okay so let's

all the subsequence
 

237
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,150
all the subsequence
what's the complexity

238
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
what's the complexity
 

239
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,270
what's the complexity
so it basically you'll be the same as

240
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
so it basically you'll be the same as
 

241
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,150
so it basically you'll be the same as
given the end characters i want to find

242
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
given the end characters i want to find
 

243
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,469
given the end characters i want to find
all right so what's the given the n

244
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
all right so what's the given the n
 

245
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,790
all right so what's the given the n
parameter and encoders

246
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
parameter and encoders
 

247
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,070
parameter and encoders
remember i want to find i

248
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
remember i want to find i
 

249
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,270
remember i want to find i
i want to find these c and one yeah

250
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
i want to find these c and one yeah
 

251
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,749
i want to find these c and one yeah
picking one picking one out of n

252
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
picking one picking one out of n
 

253
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,189
picking one picking one out of n
plus picking 2 out of 10 out of n

254
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
plus picking 2 out of 10 out of n
 

255
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,390
plus picking 2 out of 10 out of n
right plus picking 3 out of n right

256
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
right plus picking 3 out of n right
 

257
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,670
right plus picking 3 out of n right
i'm picking n out of m right

258
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:03,680
i'm picking n out of m right
 

259
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,749
i'm picking n out of m right
and possibly you can pick an n out of

260
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
and possibly you can pick an n out of
 

261
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,110
and possibly you can pick an n out of
zero yeah which is

262
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
zero yeah which is
 

263
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,430
zero yeah which is
empty yeah picking zero out of m is

264
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
empty yeah picking zero out of m is
 

265
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,230
empty yeah picking zero out of m is
empty

266
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
empty
 

267
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,909
empty
so when you add remember this

268
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
so when you add remember this
 

269
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,510
so when you add remember this
combination

270
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
combination
 

271
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,950
combination
yeah do you remember three apples out of

272
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
yeah do you remember three apples out of
 

273
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,909
yeah do you remember three apples out of
five i want to pick

274
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
five i want to pick
 

275
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,150
five i want to pick
three apples out of five apples how many

276
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
three apples out of five apples how many
 

277
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,590
three apples out of five apples how many
how many ways i can do it

278
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600

 

279
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,110

how many might be easier picking two

280
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
how many might be easier picking two
 

281
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,150
how many might be easier picking two
apples out of three

282
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
apples out of three
 

283
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,430
apples out of three
how many ways i can do it picking two

284
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
how many ways i can do it picking two
 

285
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,629
how many ways i can do it picking two
levels out of three

286
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
levels out of three
 

287
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,430
levels out of three
three three picking two levels out of

288
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
three three picking two levels out of
 

289
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,749
three three picking two levels out of
three

290
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
three
 

291
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,909
three
is equal picking three picking one

292
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
is equal picking three picking one
 

293
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,510
is equal picking three picking one
apples out of three right

294
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,520
apples out of three right
 

295
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,110
apples out of three right
and picking one apples out of three how

296
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
and picking one apples out of three how
 

297
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,629
and picking one apples out of three how
many ways three easy

298
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
many ways three easy
 

299
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,550
many ways three easy
okay so picking three out of five is

300
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
okay so picking three out of five is
 

301
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,670
okay so picking three out of five is
five times

302
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
five times
 

303
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,950
five times
is same as picking 2 apples out of 5.

304
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
is same as picking 2 apples out of 5.
 

305
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,350
is same as picking 2 apples out of 5.
so picking 2 apples out of 5 is 5 times

306
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
so picking 2 apples out of 5 is 5 times
 

307
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,469
so picking 2 apples out of 5 is 5 times
4 divided by 2

308
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
4 divided by 2
 

309
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,589
4 divided by 2
which is 10. okay so look

310
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
which is 10. okay so look
 

311
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,110
which is 10. okay so look
when you added all these together i

312
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
when you added all these together i
 

313
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,390
when you added all these together i
this is this is equations to two to the

314
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
this is this is equations to two to the
 

315
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,029
this is this is equations to two to the
power n

316
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
power n
 

317
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,550
power n
okay so the complexity o to the power n

318
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
okay so the complexity o to the power n
 

319
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,909
okay so the complexity o to the power n
times n so two to the power

320
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:11,919
times n so two to the power
 

321
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,950
times n so two to the power
and exponential is we generated

322
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
and exponential is we generated
 

323
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,950
and exponential is we generated
subsequence right

324
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
subsequence right
 

325
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,230
subsequence right
and n is the complexity of checking

326
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
and n is the complexity of checking
 

327
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,390
and n is the complexity of checking
if the subsequence is the planing jump

328
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
if the subsequence is the planing jump
 

329
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,270
if the subsequence is the planing jump
right

330
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
right
 

331
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,270
right
so all together the complexity will be

332
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
so all together the complexity will be
 

333
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,469
so all together the complexity will be

this
 

345
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,390

we can use dynamic programming okay we

346
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
we can use dynamic programming okay we
 

347
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,510
we can use dynamic programming okay we
talk about that

348
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
talk about that
 

349
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,870
talk about that
so can you tell me what's dynamic

350
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
so can you tell me what's dynamic
 

351
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,629
so can you tell me what's dynamic

00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
the right a so it's a single character
 

395
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,269
the right a so it's a single character
so what's this equal

so what's this equal
 

397
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,190
so what's this equal
one we're done yes that's what i'm

398
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
one we're done yes that's what i'm
 

399
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,630
one we're done yes that's what i'm
looking for yeah

400
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
looking for yeah
 

401
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,829
looking for yeah
yeah yeah because it's only one

402
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
yeah yeah because it's only one
 

403
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,070
yeah yeah because it's only one
character yeah it's the longest the

404
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
character yeah it's the longest the
 

405
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,430
character yeah it's the longest the
index index is a single character is a

406
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
index index is a single character is a

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,190
index index is a single character is a
pendulum right yes okay how about

408
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
pendulum right yes okay how about
 

409
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,230
pendulum right yes okay how about
dt is a

410
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
dt is a
 

411
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,829
dt is a
b if a bigger than b

412
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
b if a bigger than b
 

413
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,030
b if a bigger than b
okay if a bigger than b this is invalid

414
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
okay if a bigger than b this is invalid
 

415
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,350
okay if a bigger than b this is invalid
right

416
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
right
 

417
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,230
right
this is left this is a big right if left

418
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
this is left this is a big right if left
 

419
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,829
this is left this is a big right if left
is bigger than right this doesn't make

420
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
is bigger than right this doesn't make
 

421
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,550
is bigger than right this doesn't make
sense

422
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
sense
 

423
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,070
sense
when we make it zero right if

424
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
when we make it zero right if
 

425
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,269
when we make it zero right if
a bigger than b i'm right yeah so this

426
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
a bigger than b i'm right yeah so this
 

427
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,790
a bigger than b i'm right yeah so this
a is the left so basically look at

428
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
a is the left so basically look at
 

429
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,230
a is the left so basically look at
a1a is zero and b is two

430
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
a1a is zero and b is two
 

431
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,150
a1a is zero and b is two
so zero one two maybe zero three yeah

432
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
so zero one two maybe zero three yeah
 

433
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,670
so zero one two maybe zero three yeah
zero one two three okay so a is zero

434
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
zero one two three okay so a is zero
 

435
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,110
zero one two three okay so a is zero
b is three here so what's this

436
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,120
b is three here so what's this
 

437
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,710
b is three here so what's this
what what's tp what's tv03 in this case

438
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720

yeah four yeah you've got the one yeah

448
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
yeah four yeah you've got the one yeah
 

449
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,389
yeah four yeah you've got the one yeah
okay so this is interesting okay so

450
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
okay so this is interesting okay so
 

451
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,269
okay so this is interesting okay so
look if i don't know anything about this

452
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
look if i don't know anything about this
 

453
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,710
look if i don't know anything about this
yeah i don't know anything about this

454
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
yeah i don't know anything about this
 

455
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,509
yeah i don't know anything about this
yeah

456
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
yeah
 

457
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,430
yeah
suppose i don't know anything about this

458
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
suppose i don't know anything about this
 

459
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,670
suppose i don't know anything about this
and i have this

460
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
and i have this
 

461
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,110
and i have this
so i know a equals a yeah the index s

462
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
so i know a equals a yeah the index s
 

463
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,470
so i know a equals a yeah the index s
the s string s i equals sj here

464
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
the s string s i equals sj here
 

465
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,110
the s string s i equals sj here
right so so it means that so look

466
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
right so so it means that so look
 

467
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,110
right so so it means that so look

relation uh

500
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
relation uh
 

501
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,509
relation uh
what what how how big is this what's the

502
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
what what how how big is this what's the
 

503
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,870
what what how how big is this what's the
balance of yeah two

504
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:12,880
balance of yeah two
 

505
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,990
balance of yeah two
but we don't know if it's two right

506
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
but we don't know if it's two right
 

507
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,150
but we don't know if it's two right
this is dt a plus one

508
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
this is dt a plus one
 

509
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,790
this is dt a plus one
b minus one right and this is

510
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
b minus one right and this is
 

511
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,269
b minus one right and this is
d p a b so what's the relation between

512
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
d p a b so what's the relation between
 

513
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,870
d p a b so what's the relation between
these and this

514
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
these and this
 

515
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,310
these and this
there's how many difference

516
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
there's how many difference
 

517
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,030
there's how many difference
how many different it's right there

518
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
how many different it's right there
 

519
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,910
how many different it's right there
sorry y is

520
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
sorry y is
 

521
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,509
sorry y is
zero these two what

522
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
zero these two what
 

523
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,910
zero these two what
come on this equal this if this is the

524
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
come on this equal this if this is the
 

525
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,630
come on this equal this if this is the
pending term

526
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
pending term
 

527
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,310
pending term
if i put a two same thing at both sides

528
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
if i put a two same thing at both sides
 

529
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,389
if i put a two same thing at both sides
it will be also apparent all right

530
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
it will be also apparent all right
 

531
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,470
it will be also apparent all right
what's the difference less difference

532
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
what's the difference less difference
 

533
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,030
what's the difference less difference
minus one what's the length different

534
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
minus one what's the length different
 

535
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,230
minus one what's the length different
two yes of course i

536
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
two yes of course i
 

537
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,269
two yes of course i
added two then it will be 2 right so

538
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
added two then it will be 2 right so
 

539
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,030
added two then it will be 2 right so
if sa equals sb dpa b

540
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
if sa equals sb dpa b
 

541
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,190
if sa equals sb dpa b
equals dpa plus 1 b minus 1 plus 2

542
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
equals dpa plus 1 b minus 1 plus 2
 

543
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,710
equals dpa plus 1 b minus 1 plus 2
got it you see

544
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
got it you see
 

545
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,230
got it you see
and if it's not equal what happened

546
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
and if it's not equal what happened
 

547
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,550
and if it's not equal what happened
yeah if it's equal we know it if it's

548
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
yeah if it's equal we know it if it's
 

549
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,590
yeah if it's equal we know it if it's
not equal

550
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
not equal
 

551
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,790
not equal
what's the problem look if it's not

552
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
what's the problem look if it's not
 

553
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,030
what's the problem look if it's not
equal

554
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
equal
 

555
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,550
equal
look if this is uh

556
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
look if this is uh
 

557
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,990
look if this is uh
okay i'm just dragging here okay dp

558
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
okay i'm just dragging here okay dp
 

559
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,949
okay i'm just dragging here okay dp
this is very important okay let that be

560
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
this is very important okay let that be
 

561
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,150
this is very important okay let that be
when it's equal

562
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
when it's equal
 

563
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,910
when it's equal
okay then if s a

564
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
okay then if s a
 

565
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,190
okay then if s a
not equals sp okay

566
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
not equals sp okay
 

567
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,310
not equals sp okay
look like this a b b

568
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
look like this a b b
 

569
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,790
look like this a b b
c okay if these two are not equal

570
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
c okay if these two are not equal
 

571
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,829
c okay if these two are not equal
so what does it equal what does the

572
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
so what does it equal what does the
 

573
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,310
so what does it equal what does the
equal

574
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:53,320
equal
 

575
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,670
equal
[Music]

576
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
[Music]
 

577
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,509
[Music]
because these two are not equal is it

578
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
because these two are not equal is it
 

579
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,829
because these two are not equal is it
equals the maximum of

580
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
equals the maximum of
 

581
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,509
equals the maximum of
least bit or maximum of this bit

582
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519
least bit or maximum of this bit
 

583
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,190
least bit or maximum of this bit
yeah there are only two possibilities

584
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
yeah there are only two possibilities
 

585
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,790
yeah there are only two possibilities
yeah

586
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
yeah
 

587
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,430
yeah
does it make sense if these two are not

588
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
does it make sense if these two are not
 

589
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,910
does it make sense if these two are not
equal

590
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
equal
 

591
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,509
equal
then the length of dpij ab is equal to

592
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
then the length of dpij ab is equal to
 

593
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,949
then the length of dpij ab is equal to
the maximum of bp

594
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
the maximum of bp
 

595
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,470
the maximum of bp
a minus one and dp a plus one b

596
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
a minus one and dp a plus one b
 

597
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,710
a minus one and dp a plus one b
all right okay

598
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
all right okay
 

599
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,829
all right okay
so look if it's not equal d p

600
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
so look if it's not equal d p
 

601
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,990
so look if it's not equal d p
a b this is a bit difficult to

602
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
a b this is a bit difficult to
 

603
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,910
a b this is a bit difficult to
understand yeah equals what

604
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
understand yeah equals what
 

605
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,190
understand yeah equals what
maximum dp

606
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
maximum dp
 

607
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,790
maximum dp
a plus one b and one

608
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
a plus one b and one
 

609
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,910
a plus one b and one
bp what a and one what's that

610
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
bp what a and one what's that
 

611
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,350
bp what a and one what's that
b b y b a b

612
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
b b y b a b
 

613
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,629
b b y b a b
equals if if they are not equal if a

614
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
equals if if they are not equal if a
 

615
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,750
equals if if they are not equal if a
equal not equal c equals uh it will be

616
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
equal not equal c equals uh it will be
 

617
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,350
equal not equal c equals uh it will be
ep a a plus one b

618
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
ep a a plus one b
 

619
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,710
ep a a plus one b
yeah or a what's this

620
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
yeah or a what's this
 

621
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,829
yeah or a what's this
b minus 1

622
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
b minus 1
 

623
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,509
b minus 1
1 1 yes so basically look

624
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:09,519
1 1 yes so basically look
 

625
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,230
1 1 yes so basically look
look one more time look if this is not

626
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
look one more time look if this is not
 

627
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,350
look one more time look if this is not
equal yeah

628
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
equal yeah
 

629
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,389
equal yeah
then it should be the value of this

630
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
then it should be the value of this
 

631
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,150
then it should be the value of this
and this you see look at it

632
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
and this you see look at it
 

633
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,509
and this you see look at it
sifting one yeah

634
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
sifting one yeah
 

635
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,470
sifting one yeah
okay so this is not equal and that's it

636
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480
okay so this is not equal and that's it
 

637
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,069
okay so this is not equal and that's it
we know how to solve it

638
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
we know how to solve it
 

639
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,750
we know how to solve it
look if we know we want to solve dpa b

640
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
look if we know we want to solve dpa b
 

641
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,189
look if we know we want to solve dpa b
yeah all right so we need to solve

642
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:35,199
yeah all right so we need to solve
 

643
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,550
yeah all right so we need to solve
db a plus one b minus one if s a equals

644
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
db a plus one b minus one if s a equals
 

645
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,310
db a plus one b minus one if s a equals
s b this is known right

646
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
s b this is known right
 

647
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,110
s b this is known right
or if it's no n not known we can solve

648
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
or if it's no n not known we can solve
 

649
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,710
or if it's no n not known we can solve
db a plus one b

650
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
db a plus one b
 

651
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,189
db a plus one b
and db a b minus one which is we've got

652
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
and db a b minus one which is we've got
 

653
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:47,910
and db a b minus one which is we've got
a maximum

654
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
a maximum
 

655
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,430
a maximum
right yes so if we solve this

656
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
right yes so if we solve this
 

657
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,470
right yes so if we solve this
db db a and b a's from

658
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
db db a and b a's from
 

659
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,590
db db a and b a's from
zero to n yeah

660
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
zero to n yeah
 

661
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,710
zero to n yeah
exclusive n yeah and b

662
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:00,720

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,910
let's go and then
there are three ways coming home how

730
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
there are three ways coming home how
 

731
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,069
there are three ways coming home how
many ways all together

many ways all together
 

733
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,949
many ways all together
there are two here six is two times

734
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
there are two here six is two times
 

735
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,710
there are two here six is two times
three it's not two f3 okay

736
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
three it's not two f3 okay
 

737
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,910
three it's not two f3 okay
yeah got it because these two are

738
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:41,920
yeah got it because these two are
 

739
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,389
yeah got it because these two are
quite independent they are quite

740
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
quite independent they are quite
 

741
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,590
quite independent they are quite
independent you

742
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
independent you
 

743
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,030
independent you
multiply them together yeah okay

744
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
multiply them together yeah okay
 

745
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,749
multiply them together yeah okay
if that if they are the same you add it

746
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
if that if they are the same you add it
 

747
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,030
if that if they are the same you add it
together

748
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
together
 

749
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,710
together
if it here is the same you add it

750
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:54,720
if it here is the same you add it
 

751
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,790
if it here is the same you add it
together but when these when you combine

752
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
together but when these when you combine
 

753
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,670
together but when these when you combine
two things

754
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
two things
 

755
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,829
two things
you need to multiply the same here okay

756
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839

 

757
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,309

759
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,549

okay so now let's write the program

760
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
okay so now let's write the program
 

761
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,069
okay so now let's write the program

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,590
squared again n times n okay yeah
because look a and b a the possibility

894
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600
because look a and b a the possibility
 

895
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,549
because look a and b a the possibility
from 0 to n

right b from the possibility from 0 to n
 

899
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,070
right b from the possibility from 0 to n
so

900
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
so
 

901
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,110
so
you are actually calculating n

902
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
you are actually calculating n
 

903
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,110
you are actually calculating n
square values okay roughly in a sk

905
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,149
square values okay roughly in a sk
in a in a scale n square okay because

906
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159
in a in a scale n square okay because
 

907
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,710
in a in a scale n square okay because
when a bigger than b we just return zero

908
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
when a bigger than b we just return zero
 

909
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,390
when a bigger than b we just return zero
we don't care okay

910
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
we don't care okay
 

911
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,510
we don't care okay
okay now let's do the opposite

912
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
okay now let's do the opposite
 

913
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,549
okay now let's do the opposite
define d

914
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:20,559
define d
 

915
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,990
define d
p s we don't need a b here right

00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
p s we don't need a b here right
 

917
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,390
p s we don't need a b here right
so and we calculate the length yeah

918
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
so and we calculate the length yeah
 

919
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,750
so and we calculate the length yeah
if n equals zero if it's empty we return

920
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
if n equals zero if it's empty we return
 

921
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,070
if n equals zero if it's empty we return
what

922
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
what
 

923
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,870
what
return what if the zero string if it's

924
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:34,880
return what if the zero string if it's
 

925
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,350
return what if the zero string if it's

z yeah if n equals one will return one
 

929
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,750
z yeah if n equals one will return one
one yeah because we want only one

931
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,909

933
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,029

935
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,270

all right vp equals look 0

936
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
all right vp equals look 0
 

937
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,029
all right vp equals look 0
times n for

938
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
times n for
 

939
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,230

so what does it mean it means that dt is

942
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,400
so what does it mean it means that dt is
 

943
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,909
so what does it mean it means that dt is
a two-dimensional array okay

1000
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,440
a plus one right
 

1001
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,549
a plus one right
yeah trn

1002
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
yeah trn
 

1003
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,230
yeah trn
okay and here now we can say if

1004
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240
okay and here now we can say if
 

1005
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,230
okay and here now we can say if
s a look equals sp right

1006
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240

 

1007
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:39,270

now what should i write d p

1008
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,280

 

1009
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,669

this is quite similar than previous one

1010
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:41,679
this is quite similar than previous one
 

1011
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,110
this is quite similar than previous one
if s a equals sp

1012
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
if s a equals sp
 

1013
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,590
if s a equals sp
if these two characters are the same dp

1014
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
if these two characters are the same dp
 

1015
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,350
if these two characters are the same dp
a b equals one

1016
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360
a b equals one
 

1017
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:56,149
a b equals one
come on

1018
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159

 

1019
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,590

these two characters are the same what

1020
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
these two characters are the same what
 

1021
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,669
these two characters are the same what
happened

1022
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
happened
 

1023
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,390
happened
it's it's more than dpn

1024
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400

 

1025
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,350

and what's the two these two relations

1026
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,360
and what's the two these two relations
 

1027
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,990
and what's the two these two relations
what's what's this so this is how many

1028
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
what's what's this so this is how many
 

1029
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,630
what's what's this so this is how many
bigger than this

1030
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
bigger than this
 

1031
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,029
bigger than this
come on i just show you two minutes ago

1032
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
come on i just show you two minutes ago
 

1033
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,510
come on i just show you two minutes ago
two yeah at two come on

1034
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:23,520
two yeah at two come on
 

1035
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,470
two yeah at two come on
okay i asked look as if it's not equal

1036
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,480
okay i asked look as if it's not equal
 

1037
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,149
okay i asked look as if it's not equal
then dp

1038
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:28,159
then dp
 

1039
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,710
then dp
a b equals one maximum of what

1040
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,720
a b equals one maximum of what
 

1041
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,149
a b equals one maximum of what
maximum or what if this a s

1042
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
maximum or what if this a s
 

1043
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,669
maximum or what if this a s
a not equals sp so dpa b equals maximum

1044
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679
a not equals sp so dpa b equals maximum
 

1045
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,789
a not equals sp so dpa b equals maximum
what

1046
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:42,799

 

1047
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:58,470

bp y

1048
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480

1051
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,430

minus one minus one where yes okay so a

1052
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
minus one minus one where yes okay so a
 

1053
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,310
minus one minus one where yes okay so a
plus one b

1054
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
plus one b
 

1055
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,669
plus one b
or a minus one b yeah yeah okay and then

1056
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:09,679
or a minus one b yeah yeah okay and then
 

1057
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,190
or a minus one b yeah yeah okay and then
we turn which one

1058
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
we turn which one
 

1059
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,350
we turn which one
i calculate these two these are least

1060
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,360
i calculate these two these are least
 

1061
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,990
i calculate these two these are least
two dimensional right and right return

1062

1065
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,470
t p y zero
because i want to get it from the

1066
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480
because i want to get it from the
 

1067
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,390
because i want to get it from the
beginning to the end right

1068
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,400
beginning to the end right
 

1069
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,549
beginning to the end right
what's the end what's the n

1070
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:26,559
what's the end what's the n
 

1071
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,470
what's the end what's the n
and a you can do n minus one over

1072
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,480
and a you can do n minus one over
 

1073
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,950
and a you can do n minus one over
minus one minus one right down okay so

1074
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:32,960
minus one minus one right down okay so
 

1075
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,870
minus one minus one right down okay so
this is the bottom off so now look

1076
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
this is the bottom off so now look
 

1077
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,789
this is the bottom off so now look
compared to recursion with my

compared to recursion with my
 

1079
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,950

minimization this is a bit

1080
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
minimization this is a bit
 

1081
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,909
minimization this is a bit
uh you need to write a for loop by

1082
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
uh you need to write a for loop by
 

1083
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,350
uh you need to write a for loop by
yourself right

1084
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,360
yourself right
 

1085
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,269
yourself right
yeah yeah but for the recursion with

1086
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279
yeah yeah but for the recursion with
 

1087
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,110
yeah yeah but for the recursion with
minimization you don't need to right

1088
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
minimization you don't need to right
 

1089
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,669

the values by yourself and then you
 

1101
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,310
the values by yourself and then you
store it in this array

1102
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
store it in this array
 

1103
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,830
store it in this array
yeah what's the what's the space
