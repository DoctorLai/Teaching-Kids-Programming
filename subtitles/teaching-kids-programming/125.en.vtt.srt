3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,709

can you give me an example about the

4
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:10,719
can you give me an example about the
 

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,950
can you give me an example about the
binary okay

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
binary okay
 

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,470
binary okay
yes yeah oh where is

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
yes yeah oh where is
 

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:36,160
yes yeah oh where is
oh yes dude

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,170

 

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:43,190

[Music]

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200

 

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,950

one and i'll put one in here

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:46,960
one and i'll put one in here
 

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,910
one and i'll put one in here
okay okay so good so basically eight to

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
okay okay so good so basically eight to
 

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,709
okay okay so good so basically eight to
eight

18
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
eight
 

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,029
eight
so basically uh how many loads which one

20
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
so basically uh how many loads which one
 

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,229
so basically uh how many loads which one
is the root

22
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
is the root
 

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,830
is the root
eight eight and which one are the leaf

24
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840
eight eight and which one are the leaf
 

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,389
eight eight and which one are the leaf
notes six

26
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
notes six
 

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,430
notes six
one one okay that's good what

28
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
one one okay that's good what
 

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,030
one one okay that's good what
what is binary mean two so that means

30
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
what is binary mean two so that means
 

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,550
what is binary mean two so that means
that each node could have

32
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560
that each node could have
 

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,630
that each node could have
most two kids right and each now could

34
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
most two kids right and each now could
 

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,030
most two kids right and each now could
have

36
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
have
 

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,630
have
at most one parent except the

38
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
at most one parent except the
 

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,350
at most one parent except the
loot which doesn't have turns okay does

40
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
loot which doesn't have turns okay does
 

41
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,630
loot which doesn't have turns okay does
it make sense

42
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
it make sense
 

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,390
it make sense
yeah and for the pineal tree it does not

44
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
yeah and for the pineal tree it does not
 

45
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,749
yeah and for the pineal tree it does not
have cycles yeah it doesn't

46
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
have cycles yeah it doesn't
 

47
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,990
have cycles yeah it doesn't
have cycles all right it doesn't make

48
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
have cycles all right it doesn't make
 

49
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,070
have cycles all right it doesn't make
sense okay so for this binary trees

50
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,080
sense okay so for this binary trees
 

51
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,630
sense okay so for this binary trees
how many ways can we traverse the binary

52
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
how many ways can we traverse the binary
 

53
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,030
how many ways can we traverse the binary
trees

54
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,040

 

55
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,270

breakfast difference breakfast search

56
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
breakfast difference breakfast search
 

57
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,390
breakfast difference breakfast search
definitions okay

58
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
definitions okay
 

59
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,550
definitions okay
so if we square for search what's the

60
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
so if we square for search what's the
 

61
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,830
so if we square for search what's the
order

62
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
order
 

63
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,109
order
can you give me the order zero two six

64
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119
can you give me the order zero two six
 

65
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,109
can you give me the order zero two six
one one well the answer basically is

66
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
one one well the answer basically is
 

67
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,149
one one well the answer basically is
level by level yeah

68
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
level by level yeah
 

69
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,830
level by level yeah
and what's the definite search order

70
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840

 

71
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,429

eight zero six one two

72
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
eight zero six one two
 

73
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,069
eight zero six one two
one we're done yeah that's good so look

74
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
one we're done yeah that's good so look
 

75
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,670
one we're done yeah that's good so look
if we look at each levels

76
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
if we look at each levels
 

77
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,310
if we look at each levels
we sum it up some of the nodes in the in

78
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
we sum it up some of the nodes in the in
 

79
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,550
we sum it up some of the nodes in the in
each level so this one is level zero

80
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
each level so this one is level zero
 

81
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,149
each level so this one is level zero
with sum eight this one is number

82
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
with sum eight this one is number
 

83
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,310
with sum eight this one is number
level one which is zero two and this one

84
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
level one which is zero two and this one
 

85
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,670
level one which is zero two and this one
is number

86
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
is number
 

87
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,749
is number
eight with yellow eight number three

88
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
eight with yellow eight number three
 

89
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,510
eight with yellow eight number three
okay let's make it another one so let's

90
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
okay let's make it another one so let's
 

91
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,910
okay let's make it another one so let's
say

92
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920

 

93
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,110

is uh nine nine okay

94
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
is uh nine nine okay
 

95
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,830
is uh nine nine okay
okay so that's three oh okay

96
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840
okay so that's three oh okay
 

97
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,910
okay so that's three oh okay
nine okay so our task

98
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
nine okay so our task
 

99
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,070
nine okay so our task
is given a binary tree we want to find

100
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
is given a binary tree we want to find
 

101
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,190
is given a binary tree we want to find
out which level

102
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
out which level
 

103
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,510
out which level
has the most largest sum which is the

104
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
has the most largest sum which is the
 

105
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,350
has the most largest sum which is the
money right

106
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
money right
 

107
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,470
money right
okay so if if it's

108
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
okay so if if it's
 

109
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,509
okay so if if it's
if it has more than one level has the

110
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:37,519
if it has more than one level has the
 

111
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,150
if it has more than one level has the
same

112
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
same
 

113
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,110
same
uh same sum we can just return any of it

114
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
uh same sum we can just return any of it
 

115
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,630
uh same sum we can just return any of it
okay does it make sense

116
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
okay does it make sense
 

117
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,229
okay does it make sense
yeah yeah yeah what you're doing

118
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
yeah yeah yeah what you're doing
 

119
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,430
yeah yeah yeah what you're doing
what are you doing what's that jeffy

120
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
what are you doing what's that jeffy
 

121
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,710
what are you doing what's that jeffy
trophy okay okay trophy okay okay yeah

122
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
trophy okay okay trophy okay okay yeah
 

123
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,509
trophy okay okay trophy okay okay yeah
yeah yeah trophy yes number one three

124
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
yeah yeah trophy yes number one three
 

125
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,150
yeah yeah trophy yes number one three
yeah

126
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
yeah
 

127
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,350
yeah
okay so how are we doing this

128
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
okay so how are we doing this
 

129
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,670
okay so how are we doing this
how are we doing this is breakfast

130
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
how are we doing this is breakfast
 

131
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,470
how are we doing this is breakfast
breakfast

132
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
breakfast
 

133
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,070
breakfast
is easier you can also use the

134
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
is easier you can also use the
 

135
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,750
is easier you can also use the
differences but we can talk about it

136
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
differences but we can talk about it
 

137
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,509
differences but we can talk about it
tomorrow okay it'll be more harder

138
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
tomorrow okay it'll be more harder
 

139
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,270
tomorrow okay it'll be more harder
yeah it'll be less intuitive you know

140
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
yeah it'll be less intuitive you know
 

141
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,229
yeah it'll be less intuitive you know
because this we are calculating the sum

142
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
because this we are calculating the sum
 

143
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,430
because this we are calculating the sum
we need to

144
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
we need to
 

145
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,589
we need to
get the maximum sum right for each level

146
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
get the maximum sum right for each level
 

147
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,630
get the maximum sum right for each level
so obviously it's quite straightforward

148
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
so obviously it's quite straightforward
 

149
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,309
so obviously it's quite straightforward
is to use the breakfast version right

150
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
is to use the breakfast version right
 

151
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,949
is to use the breakfast version right
all right because it travels the tree

152
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
all right because it travels the tree
 

153
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,270
all right because it travels the tree
uh level by level okay so what kind of

154
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
uh level by level okay so what kind of
 

155
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,110
uh level by level okay so what kind of
data structure are we using to implement

156
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
data structure are we using to implement
 

157
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,589
data structure are we using to implement
a implementation

158
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
a implementation
 

159
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,509
a implementation
p q okay let's do it secondly

160
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
p q okay let's do it secondly
 

161
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,990
p q okay let's do it secondly
p f s root what's missing

162
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000

 

163
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,110

if root is noun

164
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
if root is noun
 

165
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,030
if root is noun
so if root is not which is a special

166
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
so if root is not which is a special
 

167
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,470
so if root is not which is a special
case of binary tree

168
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
case of binary tree
 

169
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,390
case of binary tree
we should yeah we can define it we can

170
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
we should yeah we can define it we can
 

171
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,390
we should yeah we can define it we can
argue it's you know or

172
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
argue it's you know or
 

173
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,830
argue it's you know or
nothing because we are retaining the

174
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
nothing because we are retaining the
 

175
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,229
nothing because we are retaining the
level which

176
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
level which
 

177
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,350
level which
it doesn't have any levels

178
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
it doesn't have any levels
 

179
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,910
it doesn't have any levels
of the nothing right so we return none

180
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
of the nothing right so we return none
 

181
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,789
of the nothing right so we return none
which is

182
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
which is
 

183
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,350
which is
more which is better yeah because mt3

184
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
more which is better yeah because mt3
 

185
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,149
more which is better yeah because mt3
does not have

186
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
does not have
 

187
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,949
does not have
any level remember the first route and

188
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
any level remember the first route and
 

189
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,910
any level remember the first route and
it's a level zero okay

190
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
it's a level zero okay
 

191
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,430
it's a level zero okay
okay so look yeah q equals what kind of

192
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
okay so look yeah q equals what kind of
 

193
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,870
okay so look yeah q equals what kind of
data structure are we using in python

194
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:21,880
data structure are we using in python
 

195
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,510
data structure are we using in python
deficit dude we initialize with the load

196
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
deficit dude we initialize with the load
 

197
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,830
deficit dude we initialize with the load
what's this what should we put here what

198
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
what's this what should we put here what
 

199
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,189
what's this what should we put here what
kind of data structure are we

200
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
kind of data structure are we
 

201
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,390
kind of data structure are we
implementing are we using as the key

202
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
implementing are we using as the key
 

203
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,710
implementing are we using as the key
thank you yes welcome bq so thank you

204
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
thank you yes welcome bq so thank you
 

205
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,070
thank you yes welcome bq so thank you
what's dq mean

206
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
what's dq mean
 

207
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,430
what's dq mean
double and the key okay whatever so

208
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
double and the key okay whatever so
 

209
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,030
double and the key okay whatever so
for the follow breakfast search

210
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
for the follow breakfast search
 

211
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,950
for the follow breakfast search
we already initialized the queue with

212
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
we already initialized the queue with
 

213
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,270
we already initialized the queue with
the loot and then if how do we check how

214
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
the loot and then if how do we check how
 

215
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,430
the loot and then if how do we check how
do we repeat one layers element in the

216
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
do we repeat one layers element in the
 

217
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,230
do we repeat one layers element in the
queue

218
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
queue
 

219
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,510
queue
so we will use the wire loop right yeah

220
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
so we will use the wire loop right yeah
 

221
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,629
so we will use the wire loop right yeah
so we can do this wire length q bigger

222
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
so we can do this wire length q bigger
 

223
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,230
so we can do this wire length q bigger
than zero right

224
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
than zero right
 

225
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,430
than zero right
right what's missing column okay so all

226
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
right what's missing column okay so all
 

227
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,590
right what's missing column okay so all
these can be replaced by just y

228
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
these can be replaced by just y
 

229
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,510
these can be replaced by just y
cubed which is simpler yeah it means

230
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
cubed which is simpler yeah it means
 

231
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,430
cubed which is simpler yeah it means
that y still lets the element in the

232
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
that y still lets the element in the
 

233
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,070
that y still lets the element in the
cube

234
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
cube
 

235
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,230
cube
correct yeah okay y q

236
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
correct yeah okay y q
 

237
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,029
correct yeah okay y q
then normally we take we kill one

238
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
then normally we take we kill one
 

239
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,029
then normally we take we kill one
element one by one right

240
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
element one by one right
 

241
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,230
element one by one right
but now for this uh

242
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
but now for this uh
 

243
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,230
but now for this uh
actually we every time we want to dq

244
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
actually we every time we want to dq
 

245
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,350
actually we every time we want to dq
the all the elements in the queue is the

246
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
the all the elements in the queue is the
 

247
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,029
the all the elements in the queue is the
pointing to the same level it's the same

248
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
pointing to the same level it's the same
 

249
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,550
pointing to the same level it's the same
level right for example look

250
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
level right for example look
 

251
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,749
level right for example look
the first one is a right now is a a is

252
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
the first one is a right now is a a is
 

253
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,670
the first one is a right now is a a is
belong to the level zero right we know

254
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
belong to the level zero right we know
 

255
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,189
belong to the level zero right we know
it's level zero right

256
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
it's level zero right
 

257
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,550
it's level zero right
if we take it out we push all the kids

258
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
if we take it out we push all the kids
 

259
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,110
if we take it out we push all the kids
of a is zero and two and the next time

260
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
of a is zero and two and the next time
 

261
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,070
of a is zero and two and the next time
we wanted to kill

262
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
we wanted to kill
 

263
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,110
we wanted to kill
we know all the kills in here will be

264
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
we know all the kills in here will be
 

265
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,230
we know all the kills in here will be
same will be the same level right

266
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
same will be the same level right
 

267
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,909
same will be the same level right
yeah that will be zero and two will be

268
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
yeah that will be zero and two will be
 

269
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,070
yeah that will be zero and two will be
level one if i take him out

270
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
level one if i take him out
 

271
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,150
level one if i take him out
and i push all the keys of zero and one

272
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
and i push all the keys of zero and one
 

273
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,830
and i push all the keys of zero and one
it will be six one two

274
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
it will be six one two
 

275
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,150
it will be six one two
and next time i take it out i know six

276
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
and next time i take it out i know six
 

277
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,909
and next time i take it out i know six
one two is the same level does it make

278
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
one two is the same level does it make
 

279
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,350
one two is the same level does it make
sense

280
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
sense
 

281
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,749
sense
okay that's good so in order to do this

282
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
okay that's good so in order to do this
 

283
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,390
okay that's good so in order to do this
we need to

284
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
we need to
 

285
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,430
we need to
have a value of value to store the

286
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
have a value of value to store the
 

287
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,150
have a value of value to store the
level yeah we call it level equals zero

288
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
level yeah we call it level equals zero
 

289
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,749
level yeah we call it level equals zero
at the beginning right

290
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
at the beginning right
 

291
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,110
at the beginning right
and then now current notes

292
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
and then now current notes
 

293
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,110
and then now current notes
let's say sc equals nanski then skill

294
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
let's say sc equals nanski then skill
 

295
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,110
let's say sc equals nanski then skill
what that means it means that we want to

296
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
what that means it means that we want to
 

297
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,469
what that means it means that we want to
know how many nodes

298
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
know how many nodes
 

299
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,309
know how many nodes
in the next level all right okay so now

300
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
in the next level all right okay so now
 

301
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,070
in the next level all right okay so now
for dash or i

302
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
for dash or i
 

303
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,950
for dash or i
in range sz

304
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
in range sz
 

305
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,309
in range sz
column yeah so now we we need to

306
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
column yeah so now we we need to
 

307
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,550
column yeah so now we we need to
do this dq how many times we need to do

308
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
do this dq how many times we need to do
 

309
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:53,990
do this dq how many times we need to do
this dq or how many times

310
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000

 

311
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,909

so for in ranges sc

312
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
so for in ranges sc
 

313
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,110
so for in ranges sc
this underscore yeah means that we don't

314
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
this underscore yeah means that we don't
 

315
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,029
this underscore yeah means that we don't
want to use any variable it doesn't

316
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
want to use any variable it doesn't
 

317
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,150
want to use any variable it doesn't
matter you can put the

318
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
matter you can put the
 

319
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,950
matter you can put the
i j k or we are not using this variable

320
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
i j k or we are not using this variable
 

321
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,029
i j k or we are not using this variable
here so that's why we just put a dash

322
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
here so that's why we just put a dash
 

323
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,110
here so that's why we just put a dash
it means we don't care right that

324
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
it means we don't care right that
 

325
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,629
it means we don't care right that
doesn't make sense

326
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
doesn't make sense
 

327
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,950
doesn't make sense
yeah and then repeat as the time and z

328
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
yeah and then repeat as the time and z
 

329
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,350
yeah and then repeat as the time and z
okay so now we also need the variable to

330
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
okay so now we also need the variable to
 

331
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,510
okay so now we also need the variable to
to sum up the value right

332
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
to sum up the value right
 

333
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,629
to sum up the value right
let's call it x okay x equals

334
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
let's call it x okay x equals
 

335
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,589
let's call it x okay x equals
zero okay and then look eric

336
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599

 

337
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,309

s equals zero let's play some equals and

338
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
s equals zero let's play some equals and
 

339
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:32,629
s equals zero let's play some equals and
x

340
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
x
 

341
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,150
x
equals let's do pq right q dot

342
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
equals let's do pq right q dot
 

343
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,589
equals let's do pq right q dot
one how do we kill top one left

344
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
one how do we kill top one left
 

345
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,870
one how do we kill top one left
first always left and always next is

346
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
first always left and always next is
 

347
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,309
first always left and always next is
right always no it's

348
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
right always no it's
 

349
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,790
right always no it's
usually okay pop left we take a kill

350
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
usually okay pop left we take a kill
 

351
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,350
usually okay pop left we take a kill
eric

352
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
eric
 

353
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,670
eric
and then take an element which is now x

354
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
and then take an element which is now x
 

355
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,390
and then take an element which is now x
and then x

356
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
and then x
 

357
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,029
and then x
plus equals one we want to edit the sum

358
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
plus equals one we want to edit the sum
 

359
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,390
plus equals one we want to edit the sum
to the x variable

360
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
to the x variable
 

361
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,430
to the x variable
so it will be x stop value yeah

362
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
so it will be x stop value yeah
 

363
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,710
so it will be x stop value yeah
right yes yeah and now i need to

364
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
right yes yeah and now i need to
 

365
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,270
right yes yeah and now i need to
push its key to to better the kill yeah

366
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
push its key to to better the kill yeah
 

367
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,230
push its key to to better the kill yeah
if x dot

368
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
if x dot
 

369
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,230
if x dot
left what should we do and and if x dot

370
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
left what should we do and and if x dot
 

371
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,150
left what should we do and and if x dot
y what should we do

372
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
y what should we do
 

373
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,940
y what should we do
can you tell me key dot

374
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:16,950
can you tell me key dot
 

375
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,309
can you tell me key dot

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,820
[Music]
open a pen yeah open s

378
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:24,830

 

379

[Music]

380
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839

 

381
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,310

now we have this sum so after this for

382
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
now we have this sum so after this for
 

383
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,509
now we have this sum so after this for
loop we know

384
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
loop we know
 

385
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,790
loop we know
that s is the current sum of the current

386
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
that s is the current sum of the current
 

387
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,630
that s is the current sum of the current
level so we need to do this

388
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
level so we need to do this
 

389
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,310
level so we need to do this
if s bigger than

390
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
if s bigger than
 

391
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,630
if s bigger than
we also need another variable called the

392
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
we also need another variable called the
 

393
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,590
we also need another variable called the
next sum okay

394
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
next sum okay
 

395
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,710
next sum okay
next sum and then

396
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
next sum and then
 

397
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,829
next sum and then
next level okay next time next level

398
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
next level okay next time next level
 

399
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,509
next level okay next time next level
okay and then initialize to

400
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
okay and then initialize to
 

401
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,870
okay and then initialize to
minus infinity okay this variable how do

402
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
minus infinity okay this variable how do
 

403
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,190
minus infinity okay this variable how do
you initialize to minus infinity

404
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
you initialize to minus infinity
 

405
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,190
you initialize to minus infinity
you do this float float

406
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
you do this float float
 

407
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,550
you do this float float
i and f converting the i n f infinity

408
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
i and f converting the i n f infinity
 

409
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,070
i and f converting the i n f infinity
okay look eigenf means infinity

410
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
okay look eigenf means infinity
 

411
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,030
okay look eigenf means infinity
converted to flow negative so

412
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040

 

413
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,230

so look if s e bigger than maximum

414
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
so look if s e bigger than maximum
 

415
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,230
so look if s e bigger than maximum
alright if x equals bigger than s sum

416
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
alright if x equals bigger than s sum
 

417
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,430
alright if x equals bigger than s sum
then what next sum equals x right

418
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
then what next sum equals x right
 

419
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,190
then what next sum equals x right
yeah and then we need to decode the

420
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
yeah and then we need to decode the
 

421
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,430
yeah and then we need to decode the
level at this time next level equals

422
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
level at this time next level equals
 

423
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,310
level at this time next level equals
level

424
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
level
 

425
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,710
level
okay we forgot the level thing look the

426
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
okay we forgot the level thing look the
 

427
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,230
okay we forgot the level thing look the
level here would be

428
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
level here would be
 

429
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,110
level here would be
level plus equals one yeah because every

430
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
level plus equals one yeah because every
 

431
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,509
level plus equals one yeah because every
time you're doing operation

432
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
time you're doing operation
 

433
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,190
time you're doing operation
you're increasing that one level i'm

434
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
you're increasing that one level i'm
 

435
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,389
you're increasing that one level i'm
right yeah and return let's return

436
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
right yeah and return let's return
 

437
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,590
right yeah and return let's return
what are we returning return map max one

438
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
what are we returning return map max one
 

439
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:14,150
what are we returning return map max one
v level next level we're returning level

440
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160

 

441
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:27,910

what's the space complex why is

442
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920

 

443
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,750

okay look because look there are lots of

444
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
okay look because look there are lots of
 

445
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,190
okay look because look there are lots of
variables that we

446
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
variables that we
 

447
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,350
variables that we
introducing right look at this maximum

448
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
introducing right look at this maximum
 

449
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,710
introducing right look at this maximum
next level right

450
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
next level right
 

451
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,150
next level right
and then we need to check it with the

452
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
and then we need to check it with the
 

453
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,069
and then we need to check it with the
bigger the max sum then we update the

454
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
bigger the max sum then we update the
 

455
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,230
bigger the max sum then we update the
maximum equals x and remember the next

456
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,240
maximum equals x and remember the next
 

457
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,750
maximum equals x and remember the next
level at this time right does it make

458
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
level at this time right does it make
 

459
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,230
level at this time right does it make
sense

460
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
sense
 

461
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,670
sense
yeah okay now we can also

462
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
yeah okay now we can also
 

463
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,470
yeah okay now we can also
we can also remove these and then use uh

464
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
we can also remove these and then use uh
 

465
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,030
we can also remove these and then use uh
let's let's just record it in in a data

466
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
let's let's just record it in in a data
 

467
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,110
let's let's just record it in in a data
yeah and every time

468
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
yeah and every time
 

469
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,630
yeah and every time
every time no no no every time we

470
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
every time no no no every time we
 

471
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,949
every time no no no every time we
we don't check this evil we just put a

472
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
we don't check this evil we just put a
 

473
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,389
we don't check this evil we just put a
theta

474
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
theta
 

475
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,470
theta
theta put it in a dictionary and level

476
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
theta put it in a dictionary and level
 

477
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,710
theta put it in a dictionary and level
up yeah because this level is

478
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
up yeah because this level is
 

479
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,069
up yeah because this level is
increasing from zero to one to two to

480
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
increasing from zero to one to two to
 

481
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,190
increasing from zero to one to two to
and equals

482
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200

 

483
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,750

so after this we have a dictionary which

484
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
so after this we have a dictionary which
 

485
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,870
so after this we have a dictionary which
has the key

486
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
has the key
 

487
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,790
has the key
as the level level and then value

488
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
as the level level and then value
 

489
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,230
as the level level and then value
as the sum right yeah now then how do we

490
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
as the sum right yeah now then how do we
 

491
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,350
as the sum right yeah now then how do we
return

492
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
return
 

493
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,030
return
how do we return if the maximum

494
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
how do we return if the maximum
 

495
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,069
how do we return if the maximum
the key of the dictionary when the value

496
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
the key of the dictionary when the value
 

497
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,870
the key of the dictionary when the value
is the maximum for example look at

498
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
is the maximum for example look at
 

499
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,910
is the maximum for example look at
like traditional yeah using this

500
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
like traditional yeah using this
 

501
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,670
like traditional yeah using this
like this p let's say p

502
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680
like this p let's say p
 

503
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,110
like this p let's say p
dot com look at p equals

504
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,120
dot com look at p equals
 

505
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,030
dot com look at p equals
eric let's see l equals a

506
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
eric let's see l equals a
 

507
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,710
eric let's see l equals a
okay ryan equals seven

508
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
okay ryan equals seven
 

509
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,790
okay ryan equals seven
equals seven okay and then how do we

510
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
equals seven okay and then how do we
 

511
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,829
equals seven okay and then how do we
return

512
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
return
 

513
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,990
return
the key of the item which has the

514
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
the key of the item which has the
 

515
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,790
the key of the item which has the
maximum value

516
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
maximum value
 

517
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,350
maximum value
is you get my point first of all you

518
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
is you get my point first of all you
 

519
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,150
is you get my point first of all you
need to

520
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
need to
 

521
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,550
need to
scale the value this is key this is

522
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
scale the value this is key this is
 

523
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,629
scale the value this is key this is
value which value has the biggest is the

524
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
value which value has the biggest is the
 

525
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,509
value which value has the biggest is the
biggest

526
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
biggest
 

527
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,230
biggest
me eight yeah and i want to return the

528
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
me eight yeah and i want to return the
 

529
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,590
me eight yeah and i want to return the
key yeah

530
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
key yeah
 

531
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,470
key yeah
doesn't make sense does it make sense

532
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480

 

533
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,350

uh yeah we can sort it um we can do this

534
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
uh yeah we can sort it um we can do this
 

535
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,110
uh yeah we can sort it um we can do this
look we can first of all get the value

536
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
look we can first of all get the value
 

537
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,870
look we can first of all get the value
v because we get one max key top values

538
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
v because we get one max key top values
 

539
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,750
v because we get one max key top values
yeah

540
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
yeah
 

541
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,550
yeah
now you need you need a values yeah you

542
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
now you need you need a values yeah you
 

543
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,829
now you need you need a values yeah you
know the value which is

544
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
know the value which is
 

545
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,310
know the value which is
eight and then you can just do this for

546
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
eight and then you can just do this for
 

547
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,110
eight and then you can just do this for
i

548
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
i
 

549
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,230
i
in p and then if

550
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
in p and then if
 

551
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,350
in p and then if
if p i equals this v

552
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:49,360
if p i equals this v
 

553
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,310
if p i equals this v
then return return i yeah does it make

554
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
then return return i yeah does it make
 

555
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,870
then return return i yeah does it make
sense

556
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
sense
 

557
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,750
sense
does it make sense does it make sense

558
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
does it make sense does it make sense
 

559
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,590
does it make sense does it make sense
first of all we get the value which is

560
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:57,600
first of all we get the value which is
 

561
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,069
first of all we get the value which is
a maximum and then we look we iterate

562
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
a maximum and then we look we iterate
 

563
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,230
a maximum and then we look we iterate
the keys with arie and ryan we check out

564
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
the keys with arie and ryan we check out
 

565
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,550
the keys with arie and ryan we check out
which value is equals to a

566
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
which value is equals to a
 

567
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,710
which value is equals to a
and we turn the i which is the key all

568
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
and we turn the i which is the key all
 

569
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,430
and we turn the i which is the key all
right we can do it using numdah which is

570
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
right we can do it using numdah which is
 

571
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,590
right we can do it using numdah which is
simpler

572
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
simpler
 

573
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,269
simpler
you know the one-time function so we can

574
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
you know the one-time function so we can
 

575
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,949
you know the one-time function so we can
do this max

576
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
do this max
 

577
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,150
do this max
look this is this is one line look p

578
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
look this is this is one line look p
 

579
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,509
look this is this is one line look p
stop items

580
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
stop items
 

581
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,150
stop items
and then how are we checking the maximum

582
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
and then how are we checking the maximum
 

583
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,269
and then how are we checking the maximum
we can use this

584
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279

 

585
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,949

lambda x column

586
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959

 

587
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,470

do x turn the key which is one x zero is

588
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
do x turn the key which is one x zero is
 

589
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,030
do x turn the key which is one x zero is
the key

590
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
the key
 

591
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,310
the key
x one is the value right and then after

592
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
x one is the value right and then after
 

593
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,949
x one is the value right and then after
this

594
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
this
 

595
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,870
this
this will return the item which is a

596
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
this will return the item which is a
 

597
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,430
this will return the item which is a
weekend eight and which i want the area

598
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
weekend eight and which i want the area
 

599
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,670
weekend eight and which i want the area
and i put a zero

600
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680

 

601
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,629

fancy syntax do you see it all right

602
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
fancy syntax do you see it all right
 

603
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,590
fancy syntax do you see it all right
yeah

604
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
yeah
 

605
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,670
yeah
yeah does it make sense this is the

606
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
yeah does it make sense this is the
 

607
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,670
yeah does it make sense this is the
lambda function number is like a shock

608
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
lambda function number is like a shock
 

609
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,470
lambda function number is like a shock
function

610
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
function
 

611
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,150
function
which is take x and then return

612
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
which is take x and then return
 

613
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,829
which is take x and then return
i mean x is the pair it's a key value

614
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
i mean x is the pair it's a key value
 

615
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,189
i mean x is the pair it's a key value
pair and i want to

616
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:09,199
pair and i want to
 

617
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,509
pair and i want to
i want to get the maximum based on the

618
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
i want to get the maximum based on the
 

619
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,230
i want to get the maximum based on the
value

620
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
value
 

621
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,269
value
here right and when i get a maximum pair

622
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:15,279
here right and when i get a maximum pair
 

623
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,670
here right and when i get a maximum pair
which is airing an eight and now i want

624
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
which is airing an eight and now i want
 

625
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,710
which is airing an eight and now i want
to return

626
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
to return
 

627
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,829
to return
the key which is zero which is area okay

628
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
the key which is zero which is area okay
 

629
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,310
the key which is zero which is area okay
so why i'm talking about this is

630
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
so why i'm talking about this is
 

631
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,150
so why i'm talking about this is
previously breakfast search

632
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
previously breakfast search
 

633
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,550
previously breakfast search
buffer search will store the level and

634
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
buffer search will store the level and
 

635
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,189
buffer search will store the level and
sum

which is the level
 

655
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,870
which is the level
am right yeah yeah does it make sense

656
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
am right yeah yeah does it make sense
 

657
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,269
am right yeah yeah does it make sense
yeah

658
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
yeah
 

659
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,310
yeah
okay uh yeah

660
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
okay uh yeah
 

661
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,430
okay uh yeah
so breakfast search okay so can you tell

662
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
so breakfast search okay so can you tell
 

663
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,189
so breakfast search okay so can you tell
everybody now what have you learned so

664
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
everybody now what have you learned so
