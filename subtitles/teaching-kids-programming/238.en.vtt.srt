00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,910
hello hello mr area are you all right
yeah so remember what's the humming

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
yeah so remember what's the humming
 

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,070
yeah so remember what's the humming
weight

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
weight
 

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,470
weight
we talked about these a few years months

8
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480
we talked about these a few years months
 

9
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,589
we talked about these a few years months
ago you eat

10
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
ago you eat
 

11
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:24,310
ago you eat
ham and you wait how much did

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320

 

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,310

what's the what's the decimal what's

14
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,320
what's the what's the decimal what's
 

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,589
what's the what's the decimal what's
this in binary what's it

16
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:27,599
this in binary what's it
 

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,029
this in binary what's it
what's this in decimal which number

18
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
what's this in decimal which number
 

19
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,470
what's this in decimal which number
15 15 yeah 15 in decimal okay

20
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
15 15 yeah 15 in decimal okay
 

21
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,190
15 15 yeah 15 in decimal okay
so this humming weight is four okay tell

22
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
so this humming weight is four okay tell
 

23
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,910
so this humming weight is four okay tell
me

24
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
me
 

25
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,600
me
what are those what

26
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:41,610
what are those what
 

27
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,350
what are those what
[Music]

28
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
[Music]
 

29
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,990
[Music]
maybe um one two one zero one zero

30
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
maybe um one two one zero one zero
 

31
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,590
maybe um one two one zero one zero
that's what that's two to the power

32
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
that's what that's two to the power
 

33
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,910
that's what that's two to the power
three plus two to the left ten

34
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
three plus two to the left ten
 

35
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,709
three plus two to the left ten
right so the hamming weight of ten is

36
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
right so the hamming weight of ten is
 

37
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,029
right so the hamming weight of ten is
two

38
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
two
 

39
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,950
two
timing way of fifteen is four okay so

40
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
timing way of fifteen is four okay so
 

41
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,549
timing way of fifteen is four okay so
can you tell me what what i'm looking

42
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:56,559
can you tell me what what i'm looking
 

43
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,549
can you tell me what what i'm looking
for here

44
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559

 

45
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,990

what

46
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000

 

47
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,149

yeah the number of ones yeah the number

48
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
yeah the number of ones yeah the number
 

49
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,990
yeah the number of ones yeah the number
ones is the hemingway okay

50
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
ones is the hemingway okay
 

51
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,630
ones is the hemingway okay
so that's good so do you still remember

52
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
so that's good so do you still remember
 

53
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,390
so that's good so do you still remember
how we calculate the hemingway how do we

54
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
how we calculate the hemingway how do we
 

55
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,910
how we calculate the hemingway how do we
take it like coming away remember

56
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
take it like coming away remember
 

57
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,270
take it like coming away remember
define hemingway let's do this hamming

58
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:17,280
define hemingway let's do this hamming
 

59
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,830
define hemingway let's do this hamming
weight

60
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
weight
 

61
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,870
weight
a number hamming weight okay i mean

62
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
a number hamming weight okay i mean
 

63
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,990
a number hamming weight okay i mean
weight

64
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
weight
 

65
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,749
weight
a number and how do we calculate the

66
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
a number and how do we calculate the
 

67
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:38,069
a number and how do we calculate the
humming weight

68
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079

 

69
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,749

there are two ways at least two ways of

70
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:39,759
there are two ways at least two ways of
 

71
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,270
there are two ways at least two ways of
doing this

72
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
doing this
 

73
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,230
doing this
two ways of doing this can you give me

74
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
two ways of doing this can you give me
 

75
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,230
two ways of doing this can you give me
an example like we can convert we need

76
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
an example like we can convert we need
 

77
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,630
an example like we can convert we need
to

78
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
to
 

79
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,710
to
convert it to string to string yeah

80
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
convert it to string to string yeah
 

81
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,749
convert it to string to string yeah
is it is it already decimal already

82
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
is it is it already decimal already
 

83
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,510
is it is it already decimal already
but we need to convert another to the

84
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
but we need to convert another to the
 

85
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,990
but we need to convert another to the
string in to the binary

86
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
string in to the binary
 

87
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,870
string in to the binary
is it like 1 no no no no it's a decimal

88
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
is it like 1 no no no no it's a decimal
 

89
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,550
is it like 1 no no no no it's a decimal
it's 15 it's not a number

90
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
it's 15 it's not a number
 

91
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,149
it's 15 it's not a number
yeah it's a number so we need to convert

92
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
yeah it's a number so we need to convert
 

93
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,749
yeah it's a number so we need to convert
into into this yeah what function you

94
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
into into this yeah what function you
 

95
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,790
into into this yeah what function you
convert these to this

96
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
convert these to this
 

97
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,910
convert these to this
no no no if you yeah if you do the

98
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
no no no if you yeah if you do the
 

99
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,750
no no no if you yeah if you do the
strings

100
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:16,760
strings
 

101
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,910
strings
str15 then we could give you this

102
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
str15 then we could give you this
 

103
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,550
str15 then we could give you this
right yeah but if you give you the

104
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
right yeah but if you give you the
 

105
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,309
right yeah but if you give you the
binary 15

106
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
binary 15
 

107
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,949
binary 15
you'll give you uh you know some

108
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
you'll give you uh you know some
 

109
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,990
you'll give you uh you know some
variable here

110
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
variable here
 

111
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,710
variable here
uh i think it's zero b one one one one

112
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
uh i think it's zero b one one one one
 

113
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,670
uh i think it's zero b one one one one
okay

114
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
okay
 

115
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,270
okay
and then here let's pin 15 and then you

116
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
and then here let's pin 15 and then you
 

117
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,470
and then here let's pin 15 and then you
you can count how many of one so we can

118
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
you can count how many of one so we can
 

119
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,509
you can count how many of one so we can
do this

120
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
do this
 

121
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,550
do this
return ping

122
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
return ping
 

123
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,710
return ping
and bin for binary yeah dot count

124
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
and bin for binary yeah dot count
 

125
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,350
and bin for binary yeah dot count
column one column

126
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360

 

127
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,030

so what's the term complexity for this

128
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
so what's the term complexity for this
 

129
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,430
so what's the term complexity for this
one we are converting these two

130
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
one we are converting these two
 

131
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,070
one we are converting these two
to uh to this is log n so it's login

132
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
to uh to this is log n so it's login
 

133
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,070
to uh to this is log n so it's login
right log in but and we we're going

134
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
right log in but and we we're going
 

135
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,309
right log in but and we we're going
through the login string so login

136
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
through the login string so login
 

137
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,589
through the login string so login
times login okay to count number one

138
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
times login okay to count number one
 

139
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,949
times login okay to count number one
okay that's one way of doing this okay

140
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
okay that's one way of doing this okay
 

141
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,070
okay that's one way of doing this okay
okay

142
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
okay
 

143
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,030
okay
log in looking okay login square to the

144
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
log in looking okay login square to the
 

145
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,830
log in looking okay login square to the
phone

146
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840

 

147
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,110

don't bite my cables cat he thinks it's

148
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
don't bite my cables cat he thinks it's
 

149
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,750
don't bite my cables cat he thinks it's
strange

150
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
strange
 

151
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,110
strange
okay so the other way how can we do this

152
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
okay so the other way how can we do this
 

153
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,910
okay so the other way how can we do this
how can we do this so if this finally is

154
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
how can we do this so if this finally is
 

155
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,550
how can we do this so if this finally is
one one

156
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
one one
 

157
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,589
one one
zero zero zero okay so

158
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
zero zero zero okay so
 

159
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,630
zero zero zero okay so
that's a bit a low

160
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
that's a bit a low
 

161
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,470
that's a bit a low
no let this is finally how can we do

162
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
no let this is finally how can we do
 

163
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,229
no let this is finally how can we do
this how can we do this

164
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
this how can we do this
 

165
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,470
this how can we do this
okay we can cut it oh no it's already

166
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
okay we can cut it oh no it's already
 

167
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,470
okay we can cut it oh no it's already
yeah we can in binary we can come

168
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
yeah we can in binary we can come
 

169
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,750
yeah we can in binary we can come
remove the very most yeah

170
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
remove the very most yeah
 

171
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,229
remove the very most yeah
one no almost one to zero then we add

172
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
one no almost one to zero then we add
 

173
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,430
one no almost one to zero then we add
one

174
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
one
 

175
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,869
one
and we move it at another one

176
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
and we move it at another one
 

177
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,470
and we move it at another one
and remove this at the number yeah

178
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
and remove this at the number yeah
 

179
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,110
and remove this at the number yeah
okay so how can we do how can we remove

180
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
okay so how can we do how can we remove
 

181
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,750
okay so how can we do how can we remove
the

182
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
the
 

183
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,429
the
the rightmost one what's the right most

184
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
the rightmost one what's the right most
 

185
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,110
the rightmost one what's the right most
how we do move this one

186
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
how we do move this one
 

187
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,910
how we do move this one
minus one and we do what this is n and

188
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
minus one and we do what this is n and
 

189
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,110
minus one and we do what this is n and
then how can we make it

190
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
then how can we make it
 

191
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,309
then how can we make it
as eric how can we make it as one zero

192
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
as eric how can we make it as one zero
 

193
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:20,789
as eric how can we make it as one zero
zero zero

194
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799

 

195
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,430

right yeah n minus one is this one right

196
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
right yeah n minus one is this one right
 

197
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,310
right yeah n minus one is this one right
and n is this one so what operation i

198
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
and n is this one so what operation i
 

199
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,749
and n is this one so what operation i
need to do to make it

200
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
need to do to make it
 

201
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,150
need to do to make it
this one come on

202
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160

 

203
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,590

[Music]

204
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
[Music]
 

205
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,469
[Music]
n and then there's n minus one so what

206
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
n and then there's n minus one so what
 

207
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,830
n and then there's n minus one so what
operation i need

208
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
operation i need
 

209
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,749
operation i need
is

210
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759

 

211
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,830

look minus one that would be one zero

212
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
look minus one that would be one zero
 

213
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,950
look minus one that would be one zero
one one one right

214
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
one one one right
 

215
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,510
one one one right
right this is binary yeah one zero one

216
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
right this is binary yeah one zero one
 

217
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,350
right this is binary yeah one zero one
one one zero and minus one that would be

218
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
one one zero and minus one that would be
 

219
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,230
one one zero and minus one that would be
one

220
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
one
 

221
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,550
one
zero one one one so what operation i

222
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
zero one one one so what operation i
 

223
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,150
zero one one one so what operation i
need to get a one zero

224
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
need to get a one zero
 

225
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,909
need to get a one zero
zero zero zero oh i think if that

226
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
zero zero zero oh i think if that
 

227
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,749
zero zero zero oh i think if that
x excuse me

228
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
x excuse me
 

229
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,950
x excuse me
how many of binary operation no if it's

230
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
how many of binary operation no if it's
 

231
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,990
how many of binary operation no if it's
all there's one right

232
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
all there's one right
 

233
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,550
all there's one right
you know all one is one right what's the

234
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
you know all one is one right what's the
 

235
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,150
you know all one is one right what's the
other one

236
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
other one
 

237
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,909
other one
what was it o

238
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
what was it o
 

239
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,950
what was it o
and and yeah and and exclusive oh

240
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
and and yeah and and exclusive oh
 

241
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,629
and and yeah and and exclusive oh
there's three kinds yeah

242
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
there's three kinds yeah
 

243
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,909
there's three kinds yeah
or is one of them is one come on

244
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
or is one of them is one come on
 

245
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,270
or is one of them is one come on
i just come and one all is one

246
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
i just come and one all is one
 

247
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,310
i just come and one all is one
see one of them is one is one right

248
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
see one of them is one is one right
 

249
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,430
see one of them is one is one right
n is both one needs to be one right

250
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
n is both one needs to be one right
 

251
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,230
n is both one needs to be one right
both needs to be one to be one right

252
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
both needs to be one to be one right
 

253
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,950
both needs to be one to be one right
correct

254
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
correct
 

255
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,870
correct
exclusive always they are different

256
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
exclusive always they are different
 

257
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,310
exclusive always they are different
right because they one

258
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
right because they one
 

259
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,350
right because they one
all exclusive zero is one zero exclusive

260
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
all exclusive zero is one zero exclusive
 

261
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,310
all exclusive zero is one zero exclusive
one is one

262
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
one is one
 

263
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,230
one is one
zero exclusive zero is zero one

264
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
zero exclusive zero is zero one
 

265
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,189
zero exclusive zero is zero one
exclusive one is zero okay

266
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
exclusive one is zero okay
 

267
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,070
exclusive one is zero okay
right so in this case what what is it

268
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
right so in this case what what is it
 

269
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,870
right so in this case what what is it
and so it's

270
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
and so it's
 

271
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,350
and so it's
n yeah and okay so we can do this

272
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
n yeah and okay so we can do this
 

273
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,510
n yeah and okay so we can do this
so another operation another one yeah

274
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
so another operation another one yeah
 

275
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,710
so another operation another one yeah
another one

276
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
another one
 

277
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,430
another one
defined let's do it another one f f n

278
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
defined let's do it another one f f n
 

279
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,070
defined let's do it another one f f n
okay

280
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080

 

281
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,870

now let's say answer equals number one

282
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
now let's say answer equals number one
 

283
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,830
now let's say answer equals number one
yeah the second one

284
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
yeah the second one
 

285
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,110
yeah the second one
implementation y y or y of n

286
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
implementation y y or y of n
 

287
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,790
implementation y y or y of n
right now together

288
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
right now together
 

289
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,430
right now together
no no no no i'm just implementing the

290
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
no no no no i'm just implementing the
 

291
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,710
no no no no i'm just implementing the
same idea twice

292
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
same idea twice
 

293
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,070
same idea twice
answer plus equals one and what we

294
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
answer plus equals one and what we
 

295
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,350
answer plus equals one and what we
want to remove the rightmost one yes n

296
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
want to remove the rightmost one yes n
 

297
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,550
want to remove the rightmost one yes n
and what equal n

298
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
and what equal n
 

299
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,390
and what equal n
minus one

300
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400

 

301
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,430

so this one complexity is

302
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
so this one complexity is
 

303
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,110
so this one complexity is
all log n right it's better than the

304
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
all log n right it's better than the
 

305
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,390
all log n right it's better than the
previous one this one is

306
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400

 

307
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,070

because first of all you want to convert

308
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
because first of all you want to convert
 

309
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,909
because first of all you want to convert
this to binary yeah

310
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
this to binary yeah
 

311
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,830
this to binary yeah
we are looking for the binary so how

312
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
we are looking for the binary so how
 

313
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,950
we are looking for the binary so how
many how many

314
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
many how many
 

315
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,749
many how many
digits we're going to if it's 1 1 1 1

316
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
digits we're going to if it's 1 1 1 1
 

317
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,990
digits we're going to if it's 1 1 1 1
then you need to

318
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
then you need to
 

319
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,150
then you need to
that's log n right in binary yeah okay

320
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
that's log n right in binary yeah okay
 

321
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,909
that's log n right in binary yeah okay
that makes sense okay so this is one way

322
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
that makes sense okay so this is one way
 

323
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,710
that makes sense okay so this is one way
this is another way actually if we can

324
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
this is another way actually if we can
 

325
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,790
this is another way actually if we can
also do this we can also

326
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
also do this we can also
 

327
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,589
also do this we can also
go into each each digit so instead of

328
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
go into each each digit so instead of
 

329
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,469
go into each each digit so instead of
look

330
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
look
 

331
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,909
look
we can do this answer plus equals

332
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
we can do this answer plus equals
 

333
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,189
we can do this answer plus equals
n and one right the rightmost bit

334
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
n and one right the rightmost bit
 

335
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,350
n and one right the rightmost bit
and then we can we can shift one

336
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
and then we can we can shift one
 

337
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,189
and then we can we can shift one
position to the right so that will be

338
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
position to the right so that will be
 

339
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,230
position to the right so that will be
n shift shift array

340
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
n shift shift array
 

341
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,749
n shift shift array
and shift shift equals one

342
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759

 

343
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,950

okay and one yeah one because look

344
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
okay and one yeah one because look
 

345
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,150
okay and one yeah one because look
we're looking at the rimer's digit and n

346
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
we're looking at the rimer's digit and n
 

347
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,390
we're looking at the rimer's digit and n
if it's zero it's zero if it's one one

348
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
if it's zero it's zero if it's one one
 

349
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,469
if it's zero it's zero if it's one one
and one is one right then we remove it

350
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
and one is one right then we remove it
 

351
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,629
and one is one right then we remove it
we shift it one that's another way but

352
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
we shift it one that's another way but
 

353
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,950
we shift it one that's another way but
this one is not as efficient as

354
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
this one is not as efficient as
 

355
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,950
this one is not as efficient as
as the previous one because the previous

356
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
as the previous one because the previous
 

357
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,950
as the previous one because the previous
one we are removing the one only we

358
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
one we are removing the one only we
 

359
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,830
one we are removing the one only we
speak

360
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
speak
 

361
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,629
speak
we are especially looking at ones right

362
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:56,639
we are especially looking at ones right
 

363
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,029
we are especially looking at ones right
if there are lots of zeros

364
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
if there are lots of zeros
 

365
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,510
if there are lots of zeros
this one will go through each bit by bit

366
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
this one will go through each bit by bit
 

367
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,150
this one will go through each bit by bit
but this

368
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
but this
 

369
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,469
but this
the previous one it will just remove one

370
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
the previous one it will just remove one
 

371
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,550
the previous one it will just remove one
so it's a little bit faster

372
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
so it's a little bit faster
 

373
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,670
so it's a little bit faster
all right correct okay if n

374
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
all right correct okay if n
 

375
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,869
all right correct okay if n
is a 32-bit it uh you know

376
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
is a 32-bit it uh you know
 

377
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,990
is a 32-bit it uh you know
integer then this takes almost 32 times

378
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
integer then this takes almost 32 times
 

379
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,309
integer then this takes almost 32 times
to

380
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
to
 

381
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,150
to
finish that in this case we are not

382
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
finish that in this case we are not
 

383
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,749
finish that in this case we are not
talking about overload and we are

384
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759
talking about overload and we are
 

385
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,189
talking about overload and we are
talking about one right because

386
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
talking about one right because
 

387
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,230
talking about one right because
it takes at most 32 iteration if the end

388
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
it takes at most 32 iteration if the end
 

389
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,110
it takes at most 32 iteration if the end
is

390
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
is
 

391
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,869
is
we know is you know

392
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:28,879

 

393
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,070

yeah okay so now so given that uh

394
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
yeah okay so now so given that uh
 

395
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,110
yeah okay so now so given that uh
given uh so as given a number

396
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
given uh so as given a number
 

397
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,149
given uh so as given a number
uh a list of numbers like 1 15

398
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
uh a list of numbers like 1 15
 

399
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,269
uh a list of numbers like 1 15
2 3 we want to we want to solve these

400
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
2 3 we want to we want to solve these
 

401
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:41,909
2 3 we want to we want to solve these
numbers

402
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
numbers
 

403
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,269
numbers
so the numbers by humming weight okay so

404
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
so the numbers by humming weight okay so
 

405
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,870
so the numbers by humming weight okay so
the more hemingway that you'll be

406
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880

 

407
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,430

you know you right the more hemingway

408
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
you know you right the more hemingway
 

409
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,310
you know you right the more hemingway
will be the

410
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
will be the
 

411
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,550
will be the
in ascending order right and if there is

412
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
in ascending order right and if there is
 

413
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,670
in ascending order right and if there is
a tire

414
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
a tire
 

415
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,389
a tire
there's a type let's say if we finally

416
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
there's a type let's say if we finally
 

417
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,030
there's a type let's say if we finally
is one one one zero zero or

418
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
is one one one zero zero or
 

419
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,070
is one one one zero zero or
or what one zero right

420
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
or what one zero right
 

421
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,630
or what one zero right
if look the coming wave of both numbers

422
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
if look the coming wave of both numbers
 

423
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,430
if look the coming wave of both numbers
is one

424
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
is one
 

425
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,550
is one
and we need to put these numbers first

426
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
and we need to put these numbers first
 

427
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,910
and we need to put these numbers first
because this one is bigger so we already

428
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
because this one is bigger so we already
 

429
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,870
because this one is bigger so we already
know that

430
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
know that
 

431
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,430
know that
this the function the saw yeah so we

432
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
this the function the saw yeah so we
 

433
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,470
this the function the saw yeah so we
just have to

434
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
just have to
 

435
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,990
just have to
put a key right define let's say

436
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
put a key right define let's say
 

437
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,150
put a key right define let's say
f lumps yeah

438
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160

 

439
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,509

we just need to do list return

440
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
we just need to do list return
 

441
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,030
we just need to do list return
soft sorted okay sorted and nums

442
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
soft sorted okay sorted and nums
 

443
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,230
soft sorted okay sorted and nums
right look usually we do this and we can

444
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
right look usually we do this and we can
 

445
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,870
right look usually we do this and we can
put

446
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
put
 

447
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,590
put
provide a key we want to sort it by the

448
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
provide a key we want to sort it by the
 

449
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,150
provide a key we want to sort it by the
key which

450
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
key which
 

451
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,150
key which
is what we can call this number

452
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
is what we can call this number
 

453
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,829
is what we can call this number
number

454
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839

 

455
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,509

x f x or r g

456
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
x f x or r g
 

457
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,509
x f x or r g
x this is the humming way the hemming

458
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
x this is the humming way the hemming
 

459
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,990
x this is the humming way the hemming
weight

460
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000

 

461
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,070

um but that second time second parameter

462
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
um but that second time second parameter
 

463
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,190
um but that second time second parameter
will be x right

464
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
will be x right
 

465
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,389
will be x right
that's it so that will look

466
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
that's it so that will look
 

467
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,790
that's it so that will look
we're passing this this as a new

468
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
we're passing this this as a new
 

469
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,110
we're passing this this as a new
parameter key equals

470
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
parameter key equals
 

471
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,550
parameter key equals
key equals key equals number x

472
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
key equals key equals number x
 

473
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,590
key equals key equals number x
yeah that's the point of x i like your

474
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
yeah that's the point of x i like your
 

475
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,030
yeah that's the point of x i like your
return of two parts

476
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
return of two parts
 

477
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,790
return of two parts
look at this will return the two parts

478
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
look at this will return the two parts
 

479
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,710
look at this will return the two parts
the first one is hemingway so basically

480
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
the first one is hemingway so basically
 

481
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,509
the first one is hemingway so basically
you will saw

482
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
you will saw
 

483
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,790
you will saw
you will saw the numbers by two things

484
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
you will saw the numbers by two things
 

485
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,829
you will saw the numbers by two things
one the first thing is the hemingway if

486
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
one the first thing is the hemingway if
 

487
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,550
one the first thing is the hemingway if
the hemingway

488
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
the hemingway
 

489
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,790
the hemingway
is the same then you look at the actual

490
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:28,800
is the same then you look at the actual
 

491
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,990
is the same then you look at the actual
value okay so

492
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
value okay so
 

493
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,030
value okay so
that's what it means yeah okay

494
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
that's what it means yeah okay
 

495
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,110
that's what it means yeah okay
okay so actually you can do this as well

496
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
okay so actually you can do this as well
 

497
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,230
okay so actually you can do this as well
you can so

498
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
you can so
 

499
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,069
you can so
num dot sort yeah soft and then you can

500
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
num dot sort yeah soft and then you can
 

501
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,829
num dot sort yeah soft and then you can
do this key

502
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
do this key
 

503
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,150
do this key
equals this is the same thing here right

504
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
equals this is the same thing here right
 

505
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,910
equals this is the same thing here right
and then return num this is the same

506
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
and then return num this is the same
 

507
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,470
and then return num this is the same
thing

508
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480

 

509
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,949

okay written so and actually you can do

510
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
okay written so and actually you can do
 

511
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,509
okay written so and actually you can do
this

512
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
this
 

513
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,230
this
reverse if you want to start it from the

514
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
reverse if you want to start it from the
 

515
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,310
reverse if you want to start it from the
largest to the smallest you can do this

516
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
largest to the smallest you can do this
 

517
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,829
largest to the smallest you can do this
reverse

518
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
reverse
 

519
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,710
reverse
reverse equal reverse equals two right

520
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
reverse equal reverse equals two right
 

521
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,230
reverse equal reverse equals two right
by default is false right

522
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:02,240
by default is false right
 

523
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,790
by default is false right
so this is something uh you can do this

524
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
so this is something uh you can do this
 

525
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,150
so this is something uh you can do this
passing the parameter

526
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
passing the parameter
 

527
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,910
passing the parameter
reverse or key right key equals

528
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
reverse or key right key equals
 

529
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,069
reverse or key right key equals
number x x so let's take an x

530
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
number x x so let's take an x
 

531
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,230
number x x so let's take an x
and return a tuple which is the first of

532
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
and return a tuple which is the first of
 

533
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,230
and return a tuple which is the first of
all is the harming weight

534
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
all is the harming weight
 

535
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,870
all is the harming weight
and the second value is the value itself

536
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
and the second value is the value itself
 

537
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,550
and the second value is the value itself
so when we pass this

538
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
so when we pass this
 

539
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,190
so when we pass this
lambda key lambda is a short function

540
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
lambda key lambda is a short function
 

541
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,269
lambda key lambda is a short function
that takes the parameter x

542
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
that takes the parameter x
 

543
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,870
that takes the parameter x
you we are based on the hemingway first

544
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
you we are based on the hemingway first
 

545
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,350
you we are based on the hemingway first
you have your sort solar numbers sorting

546
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
you have your sort solar numbers sorting
 

547
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,110
you have your sort solar numbers sorting
the numbers based on the hemingway

548
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
the numbers based on the hemingway
 

549
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,790
the numbers based on the hemingway
and if you laser tie if there are two

550
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
and if you laser tie if there are two
 

551
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,870
and if you laser tie if there are two
numbers the hemingway is the same yeah

552
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
numbers the hemingway is the same yeah
 

553
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,470
numbers the hemingway is the same yeah
can you give me an example of two

554
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
can you give me an example of two
 

555
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,630
can you give me an example of two
hemingway is the same two numbers

556
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
hemingway is the same two numbers
 

557
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,310
hemingway is the same two numbers
which has the same hemingway just any

558
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
which has the same hemingway just any
 

559
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,829
which has the same hemingway just any
example

560
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
example
 

561
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,670
example
come on the number ones are the same so

562
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680
come on the number ones are the same so
 

563
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,269
come on the number ones are the same so
what are those there are a lot of

564
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
what are those there are a lot of
 

565
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,110
what are those there are a lot of
examples

566
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
examples
 

567
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,190
examples
hello it should be quick

568
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200

 

569
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,230

what

570
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240

 

571
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,670

come on two what any any example

572
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
come on two what any any example
 

573
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,430
come on two what any any example
think in binary hemingway

574
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440

 

575
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,509

number one says the same so can you give

576
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
number one says the same so can you give
 

577
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,670
number one says the same so can you give
me a talk

578
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
me a talk
 

579
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,949
me a talk
in what in a num in an integer a

580
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:16,959
in what in a num in an integer a
 

581
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,670
in what in a num in an integer a
and b if they are say i say f a equals f

582
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
and b if they are say i say f a equals f
 

583
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,269
and b if they are say i say f a equals f
equals f b

584
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
equals f b
 

585
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,750
equals f b
so what are a and b give me example lots

586
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
so what are a and b give me example lots
 

587
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,470
so what are a and b give me example lots
of examples

588
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
of examples
 

589
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,030
of examples
hemingway's the number of ones in binary

590
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
hemingway's the number of ones in binary
 

591
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,990
hemingway's the number of ones in binary
is the same like 15 is one one one one

592
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
is the same like 15 is one one one one
 

593
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,590
is the same like 15 is one one one one
okay so can you think about another

594
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
okay so can you think about another
 

595
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,910
okay so can you think about another
number which has four

596
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
number which has four
 

597
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,829
number which has four
you know for what four ones but

598
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
you know for what four ones but
 

599
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,470
you know for what four ones but
different wait wait

600
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
different wait wait
 

601
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,310
different wait wait
it's quite easy yeah you put a zero at

602
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
it's quite easy yeah you put a zero at
 

603
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,590
it's quite easy yeah you put a zero at
the end what happened if you put the

604
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
the end what happened if you put the
 

605
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,310
the end what happened if you put the
zero

606
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
zero
 

607
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,629
zero
right what happened if you put a zero at

608
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
right what happened if you put a zero at
 

609
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,949
right what happened if you put a zero at
a binary

610
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
a binary
 

611
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,550
a binary
what make what does it mean

612
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
what make what does it mean
 

613
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,509
what make what does it mean
what does it mean if if one is one one

614
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
what does it mean if if one is one one
 

615
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,269
what does it mean if if one is one one
zero is one

616
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279

 

617
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,910

two yeah so one zero zero is one

618
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920

 

619
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,910

two yeah so you put a zero at the end

620
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
two yeah so you put a zero at the end
 

621
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,790
two yeah so you put a zero at the end
what happened

622
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
what happened
 

623
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,140
what happened
in binary

624
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,150
in binary
 

625
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,829
in binary
[Music]

626
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
[Music]
 

627
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,990
[Music]
double it yeah you double it so you give

628
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
double it yeah you double it so you give
 

629
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,310
double it yeah you double it so you give
me any number and then you double it it

630
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
me any number and then you double it it
 

631
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,310
me any number and then you double it it
has the same timing where

632
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
has the same timing where
 

633
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,389
has the same timing where
100 and double it two hundred they have

634
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
100 and double it two hundred they have
 

635
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,829
100 and double it two hundred they have
percent hemingway all right

636
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
percent hemingway all right
 

637
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,870
percent hemingway all right
okay fifteen and thirty right

638
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
okay fifteen and thirty right
 

639
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,110
okay fifteen and thirty right
fifteen thirty

640
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120

 

641
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,829

sometiming way right four do you get it

642
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839
sometiming way right four do you get it
 

643
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,150
sometiming way right four do you get it
yeah two four

644
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
yeah two four
 

645
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,230
yeah two four
eight sixteen they're all seven coming

646
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
eight sixteen they're all seven coming
 

647
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,870
eight sixteen they're all seven coming
away only one okay

648
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
away only one okay
 

649
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,069
away only one okay
yeah does it make sense yeah

650
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079
yeah does it make sense yeah
 

651
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,310
yeah does it make sense yeah
okay so uh if each layer have some

652
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
okay so uh if each layer have some
 

653
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,389
okay so uh if each layer have some
hemingway this the first parameter is

654
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
hemingway this the first parameter is
 

655
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,230
hemingway this the first parameter is
the same and then we'll look at actual

656
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
the same and then we'll look at actual
 

657
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,790
the same and then we'll look at actual
value

658
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
value
 

659
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,870
value
right look at the actual value so your

660
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:54,880
right look at the actual value so your
 

661
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,470
right look at the actual value so your
thoughts based on the actual value

662
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480

thoughts based on the actual value
what's the time complexity if you have a

664
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
what's the time complexity if you have a
 

665
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,829
what's the time complexity if you have a
thought

666
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839

 

667
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,210

um

okay that's it for today that's it for

672
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
okay that's it for today that's it for

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,150
okay that's it for today that's it for
today

674

675
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,269

okay can you write a hemingway function

676
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:13,279
okay can you write a hemingway function
 

677
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:28,829
okay can you write a hemingway function
come on

678
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839

 

679
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,509

what

680
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519

 

681
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,990

we convert it to binary string

682
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000

 

683
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,069

how do you convert it to binary string

684
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
how do you convert it to binary string
 

685
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:53,030
how do you convert it to binary string
the function start with start with b

686
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040

 

687
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:08,710

yeah being b i n star so for binary

688
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720

 

689
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,670

okay and what do we do with that

690
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
okay and what do we do with that
 

691
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,870
okay and what do we do with that
we are on the count right

692
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
we are on the count right
 

693
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,910
we are on the count right
count yeah dot count

694
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920

 

695

kawa f kawa
 

697
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,629
kawa f kawa
what are we doing here binary come what

698
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
what are we doing here binary come what
 

699
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,550
what are we doing here binary come what
we turn it into binary string we want to

700
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
we turn it into binary string we want to
 

701
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,710
we turn it into binary string we want to
count how many of what

702
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
count how many of what
 

703
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,749
count how many of what
um

704
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:35,759

 

705
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,829

how many words one there are how many

706
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
how many words one there are how many
 

707
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,670
how many words one there are how many
card ones

708
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680

 

709
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,110

bracket come on i just

710

bracket come on i just
 

711
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,189
bracket come on i just
have one you want color function call

712
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
have one you want color function call
 

713
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,350
have one you want color function call
one you need a bracket come on

714
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
one you need a bracket come on
 

715
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,790
one you need a bracket come on
yeah yeah i know what needs to be

716
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
yeah yeah i know what needs to be
 

717
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,030
yeah yeah i know what needs to be
quoted because it's a string right oh

718
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
quoted because it's a string right oh
 

719
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,990
quoted because it's a string right oh
okay

720
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
okay
 

721
