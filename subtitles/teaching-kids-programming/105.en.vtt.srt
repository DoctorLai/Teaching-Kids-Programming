go hello hello hello miss mary mr ryan

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
go hello hello hello miss mary mr ryan
 

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,470
go hello hello hello miss mary mr ryan
how are you today

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,480
how are you today
 

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,629
how are you today
good okay so today we're gonna talk

6
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
good okay so today we're gonna talk
 

7
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,709
good okay so today we're gonna talk
about today we're gonna talk about

8
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:10,719
about today we're gonna talk about
 

9
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,750
about today we're gonna talk about
uh subsequence so what's the subsequence

10
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:17,760
uh subsequence so what's the subsequence
 

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,230
uh subsequence so what's the subsequence
uh right

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240

 

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,750

what sequence it's a subsequence for

14
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
what sequence it's a subsequence for
 

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,029
what sequence it's a subsequence for
example like

16
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
example like
 

17
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,000
example like
a b c

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,010

 

19
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,470

[Music]

20
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480

 

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,470

yes yes so basically this is the

22
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
yes yes so basically this is the
 

23
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,389
yes yes so basically this is the
original string you can

24
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
original string you can
 

25
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,830
original string you can
dedic nothing or you can did it one or

26
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
dedic nothing or you can did it one or
 

27
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,229
dedic nothing or you can did it one or
more

28
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
more
 

29
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,670
more
characters look if i did release did it

30
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
characters look if i did release did it
 

31
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,310
characters look if i did release did it
please list then it becomes left so abc

32
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
please list then it becomes left so abc
 

33
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,869
please list then it becomes left so abc
is the

34
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:52,879
is the
 

35
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,830
is the
subsequent zone and here right right abc

36
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840
subsequent zone and here right right abc
 

37
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,990
subsequent zone and here right right abc
is

38
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
is
 

39
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,110
is
a b c s sub sequence of abc

40
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
a b c s sub sequence of abc
 

41
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,270
a b c s sub sequence of abc
of course i said did it now or okay

42
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,280
of course i said did it now or okay
 

43
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,910
of course i said did it now or okay
but okay so how about if a string like a

44
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
but okay so how about if a string like a
 

45
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,390
but okay so how about if a string like a
b c

46
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
b c
 

47
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,390
b c
d e and then i give you a string which

48
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,400
d e and then i give you a string which
 

49
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,870
d e and then i give you a string which
is shorter is it a subsequence

50
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
is shorter is it a subsequence
 

51
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,149
is shorter is it a subsequence
no no right because this is this is

52
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
no no right because this is this is
 

53
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,230
no no right because this is this is
this is longer than the target like an

54
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
this is longer than the target like an
 

55
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,670
this is longer than the target like an
original string so

56
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:19,680
original string so
 

57
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,149
original string so
it can't be possible we can't possibly

58
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
it can't be possible we can't possibly
 

59
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,710
it can't be possible we can't possibly
delete any now if we didn't numb

60
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
delete any now if we didn't numb
 

61
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,429
delete any now if we didn't numb
it doesn't match right yeah okay so

62
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
it doesn't match right yeah okay so
 

63
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,710
it doesn't match right yeah okay so
today

64
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
today
 

65
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,670
today
we're going to talk about an algorithm

66
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
we're going to talk about an algorithm
 

67
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,310
we're going to talk about an algorithm
to

68
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
to
 

69
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,350
to
find out to check if your string s

70
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
find out to check if your string s
 

71
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,630
find out to check if your string s
is a subsequence of t r r i

72
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
is a subsequence of t r r i
 

73
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:49,420
is a subsequence of t r r i
i

74
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:49,430

 

75
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,710

[Music]

76
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720

 

77
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,190

so look this is the starting point so

78
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,200
so look this is the starting point so
 

79
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,910
so look this is the starting point so
how can we

80
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
how can we
 

81
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,670
how can we
check how can we check it with the

82
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
check how can we check it with the
 

83
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,950
check how can we check it with the
subsequence if

84
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
subsequence if
 

85
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,670
subsequence if
this first string is acceptable

86
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680

 

87
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,789

okay so yeah and then you check these if

88
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
okay so yeah and then you check these if
 

89
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,550
okay so yeah and then you check these if
it's in it then what

90
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
it's in it then what
 

91
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,190
it's in it then what
you can you get the next one but this

92
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
you can you get the next one but this
 

93
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,070
you can you get the next one but this
may not work

94
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
may not work
 

95
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,630
may not work
look if you have if you have if you have

96
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
look if you have if you have if you have
 

97
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,910
look if you have if you have if you have
this eic

98
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:15,920
this eic
 

99
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,190
this eic
and and r

100
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
and and r
 

101
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,710
and and r
r e e i c look

102
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
r e e i c look
 

103
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,990
r e e i c look
you check e in the subsequence but ah

104
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
you check e in the subsequence but ah
 

105
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,309
you check e in the subsequence but ah
also in the subsequence on the second

106
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
also in the subsequence on the second
 

107
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,670
also in the subsequence on the second
string

108
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
string
 

109
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,309
string
do you get it these needs to be ordered

110
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
do you get it these needs to be ordered
 

111
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,869
do you get it these needs to be ordered
so this is not a subsequence of that

112
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
so this is not a subsequence of that
 

113
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,710
so this is not a subsequence of that
yeah this is not a subsequence of that

114
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
yeah this is not a subsequence of that
 

115
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,550
yeah this is not a subsequence of that
all right all right

116
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
all right all right
 

117
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,470
all right all right
does it make sense so your approach may

118
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
does it make sense so your approach may
 

119
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,589
does it make sense so your approach may
not work right

120
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
not work right
 

121
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,430
not work right
yeah so how can we fix this

122
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
yeah so how can we fix this
 

123
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,110
yeah so how can we fix this
it

124
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120

 

125
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,550

the is of it so this

126
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
the is of it so this
 

127
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,430
the is of it so this
is no subsequence of it because e must

128
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
is no subsequence of it because e must
 

129
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,030
is no subsequence of it because e must
come before r but this one

130
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
come before r but this one
 

131
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,750
come before r but this one
is come after r right yeah so it's not

132
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
is come after r right yeah so it's not
 

133
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,430
is come after r right yeah so it's not
subsequence yeah

134
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
subsequence yeah
 

135
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,390
subsequence yeah
so how can we fix your algorithm so

136
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
so how can we fix your algorithm so
 

137
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,509
so how can we fix your algorithm so
you're saying that e

138
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
you're saying that e
 

139
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,990
you're saying that e
you check in between that okay it's and

140
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
you check in between that okay it's and
 

141
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,710
you check in between that okay it's and
then you check

142
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
then you check
 

143
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,949
then you check
the next one yeah

144
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959

 

145
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,070

you check it danny

146
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080

 

147
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,630

oh that's a good approach yeah yeah that

148
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
oh that's a good approach yeah yeah that
 

149
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,910
oh that's a good approach yeah yeah that
was all thinking though

150
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
was all thinking though
 

151
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,670
was all thinking though
yeah yeah that's a very good approach so

152
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
yeah yeah that's a very good approach so
 

153
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,430
yeah yeah that's a very good approach so
you eat you find it

154
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
you eat you find it
 

155
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,630
you eat you find it
and you wrap it up yeah right but

156
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640
and you wrap it up yeah right but
 

157
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,190
and you wrap it up yeah right but
but again i can wrap it up e okay so

158
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
but again i can wrap it up e okay so
 

159
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,830
but again i can wrap it up e okay so
which e you want to wrap it up

160
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
which e you want to wrap it up
 

161
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,509
which e you want to wrap it up
i want to roll out the second

162
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
i want to roll out the second
 

163
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,149
i want to roll out the second
section it doesn't matter you drop it or

164
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
section it doesn't matter you drop it or
 

165
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,190
section it doesn't matter you drop it or
oh or even

166
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
oh or even
 

167
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,190
oh or even
one one so

168
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200

 

169
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,350

look this approach still doesn't solve

170
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
look this approach still doesn't solve
 

171
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,869
look this approach still doesn't solve
the it has to be all

172
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
the it has to be all
 

173
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,750
the it has to be all
in order you find this e the next one

174
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
in order you find this e the next one
 

175
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,190
in order you find this e the next one
you find is e the next

176
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
you find is e the next
 

177
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,030
you find is e the next
r should be on the right hand side not

178
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
r should be on the right hand side not
 

179
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,710
r should be on the right hand side not
the left hand side do you get it

180
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720

 

181
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,990

he finds e

182
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000

 

183
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,110

he find r yeah

184
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
he find r yeah
 

185
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,149
he find r yeah
wait wait wait you find e and if i you

186
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
wait wait wait you find e and if i you
 

187
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,509
wait wait wait you find e and if i you
check if his eyes come

188
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
check if his eyes come
 

189
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,400
check if his eyes come
before after e yeah

190
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:17,410

 

191
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,469

[Music]

192
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
[Music]
 

193
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,830
[Music]
so sorry no idea wait wait

194
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840
so sorry no idea wait wait
 

195
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,390
so sorry no idea wait wait
wait okay that's fine look

196
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
wait okay that's fine look
 

197
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,310
wait okay that's fine look
how about you will you use two pointers

198
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
how about you will you use two pointers
 

199
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,150
how about you will you use two pointers
pointing to look yeah

200
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
pointing to look yeah
 

201
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,430
pointing to look yeah
yeah okay let it equal yeah then i can

202
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
yeah okay let it equal yeah then i can
 

203
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,469
yeah okay let it equal yeah then i can
move both sides

204
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
move both sides
 

205
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:48,150
move both sides
there no they're not easier not equal

206
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160

 

207
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,990

can we move this one and we know this

208
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
can we move this one and we know this
 

209
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,310
can we move this one and we know this
one because this is we haven't found it

210
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
one because this is we haven't found it
 

211
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,950
one because this is we haven't found it
yet so here ah okay now

212
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960

 

213
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,590

both of them why can we move both of

214
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
both of them why can we move both of
 

215
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,310
both of them why can we move both of
them

216
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
them
 

217
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,830
them
because at least we have more match we

218
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
because at least we have more match we
 

219
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,830
because at least we have more match we
need to find next one and this okay

220
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840

 

221
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:21,670

move

222
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680

 

223
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,830

and then okay we reached the end and

224
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
and then okay we reached the end and
 

225
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,510
and then okay we reached the end and
then now we just need to check

226
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
then now we just need to check
 

227
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,270
then now we just need to check
if the point of love s is the end of the

228
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
if the point of love s is the end of the
 

229
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,950
if the point of love s is the end of the
yeah 30. yeah does it make sense

230
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
yeah 30. yeah does it make sense
 

231
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,870
yeah 30. yeah does it make sense
so two pointers yeah yeah okay

232
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
so two pointers yeah yeah okay
 

233
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,870
so two pointers yeah yeah okay
so let's let's learn radical

234
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
so let's let's learn radical
 

235
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,790
so let's let's learn radical
define is subsequence

236
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
define is subsequence
 

237
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,909
define is subsequence
as we want to check as if it's the

238
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
as we want to check as if it's the
 

239
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,189
as we want to check as if it's the
subsequent of t what's

240
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
subsequent of t what's
 

241
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,029
subsequent of t what's
missing here how yeah always

242
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
missing here how yeah always
 

243
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,390
missing here how yeah always
okay let's do the s a l

244
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
okay let's do the s a l
 

245
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,790
okay let's do the s a l
s l t is the length of both strings so

246
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
s l t is the length of both strings so
 

247
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,670
s l t is the length of both strings so
let's do it

248
00:05:59,670 --> 00:05:59,680
let's do it
 

249
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,710
let's do it
a l and s a and

250
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
a l and s a and
 

251
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,469
a l and s a and
t yeah and

252
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
t yeah and
 

253
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,590
t yeah and
yeah if air s is bigger than lt

254
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
yeah if air s is bigger than lt
 

255
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,950
yeah if air s is bigger than lt
what does it mean if the first string is

256
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
what does it mean if the first string is
 

257
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,550
what does it mean if the first string is
the bigger than the

258
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
the bigger than the
 

259
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,270
the bigger than the
next string what does it mean the first

260
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
next string what does it mean the first
 

261
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,070
next string what does it mean the first
string is

262
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
string is
 

263
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,469
string is
false return first because in this case

264
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
false return first because in this case
 

265
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,189
false return first because in this case
it's not

266
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
it's not
 

267
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,469
it's not
not a subsequent as it's not subsequent

268
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
not a subsequent as it's not subsequent
 

269
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,749
not a subsequent as it's not subsequent
now we have two points okay i see

270
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
now we have two points okay i see
 

271
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,950
now we have two points okay i see
i equals j equals zero that means what

272
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
i equals j equals zero that means what
 

273
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:44,710
i equals j equals zero that means what
means i and j both are equal to zero

274
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720

 

275
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,029

so both points are not reaching the end

276
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
so both points are not reaching the end
 

277
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,950
so both points are not reaching the end
okay and

278
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
okay and
 

279
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,309
okay and
one hand and j

280
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
one hand and j
 

281
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,830
one hand and j
is smaller is lt okay look

282
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
is smaller is lt okay look
 

283
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,830
is smaller is lt okay look
if s i equals

284
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
if s i equals
 

285
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,950
if s i equals
as f i equals t t j what

286
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
as f i equals t t j what
 

287
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,230
as f i equals t t j what
what do we do if s i equals t

288
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
what do we do if s i equals t
 

289
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,990
what do we do if s i equals t
j what should we do 3

290
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
j what should we do 3
 

291
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,749
j what should we do 3
no true if the two pointers the same

292
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
no true if the two pointers the same
 

293
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,110
no true if the two pointers the same
the character what should we do

294
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
the character what should we do
 

295
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,670
the character what should we do
both move one okay i plus equals one and

296
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
both move one okay i plus equals one and
 

297
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,550
both move one okay i plus equals one and
else

298
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
else
 

299
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,909
else
three plus equals one a is one

300
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
three plus equals one a is one
 

301
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,390
three plus equals one a is one
as if it's not equal we only move the

302
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
as if it's not equal we only move the
 

303
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,430
as if it's not equal we only move the
which one

304
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
which one
 

305
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,629
which one
t t one so two plus equals one look if i

306
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
t t one so two plus equals one look if i
 

307
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,350
t t one so two plus equals one look if i
look look this is duplicate yeah you see

308
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
look look this is duplicate yeah you see
 

309
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,909
look look this is duplicate yeah you see
two so what can we do is we erase at

310
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
two so what can we do is we erase at
 

311
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,909
two so what can we do is we erase at
least equates at least

312
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
least equates at least
 

313
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,589
least equates at least
but no no it is a ring and i'm putting

314
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
but no no it is a ring and i'm putting
 

315
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,350
but no no it is a ring and i'm putting
three outside okay so j

316
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
three outside okay so j
 

317
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,309
three outside okay so j
plus equals one all right okay when we

318
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
plus equals one all right okay when we
 

319
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:46,710
plus equals one all right okay when we
turn

320
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
turn
 

321
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,390
turn
at the end we need to check which one

322
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
at the end we need to check which one
 

323
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,629
at the end we need to check which one
which front pointer

324
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
which front pointer
 

325
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,710
which front pointer
which which hand at the end we want to

326
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
which which hand at the end we want to
 

327
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,749
which which hand at the end we want to
check which hand

328
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
check which hand
 

329
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,510
check which hand
reaches the end

330
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520

 

331
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,110

where's your hand which hand the top one

332
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
where's your hand which hand the top one
 

333
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,629
where's your hand which hand the top one
yeah the top one the shorter one which

334
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
yeah the top one the shorter one which
 

335
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,150
yeah the top one the shorter one which
is sorting

336
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160

 

337
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,830

and the pointer of s is which which

338
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840
and the pointer of s is which which
 

339
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,670
and the pointer of s is which which
value

340
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
value
 

341
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,309
value
uh i or j

342
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
uh i or j
 

343
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,670
uh i or j
i or j which one is the i which one is

344
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
i or j which one is the i which one is
 

345
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,950
i or j which one is the i which one is
the z

346
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
the z
 

347
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,950
the z
come on you can read the code look ls

348
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
come on you can read the code look ls
 

349
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,510
come on you can read the code look ls
equals length as lt equals length

350
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
equals length as lt equals length
 

351
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,589
equals length as lt equals length
i equals j equals 0 1 i smaller than ls

352
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
i equals j equals 0 1 i smaller than ls
 

353
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,110
i equals j equals 0 1 i smaller than ls
t i equals a sorry

354
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
t i equals a sorry
 

355
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,509
t i equals a sorry
j is lt the second point so i want to

356
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
j is lt the second point so i want to
 

357
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:47,190
j is lt the second point so i want to
check which pointer i

358
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200

 

359
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,910

what is the value of the i when it's

360
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
what is the value of the i when it's
 

361
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,829
what is the value of the i when it's
reaching the end

362
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839

 

363
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,550

lsrt

364
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560

 

365
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,269

lengthy yes

366
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
lengthy yes
 

367
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,110
lengthy yes
what's the term complexity

368
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120

 

369
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,870

what's this n can you explain to me

370
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
what's this n can you explain to me
 

371
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,190
what's this n can you explain to me
what's this n

372
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
what's this n
 

373
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,040
what's this n
it's

374
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,050
it's
 

375
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,870
it's
[Music]

376
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
[Music]
 

377
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,389
[Music]
the name

378
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399

 

379
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:26,230

it's the length of s or and length of t

380
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240

 

381
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,870

because in the worst case the tea worse

382
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
because in the worst case the tea worse
 

383
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,949
because in the worst case the tea worse
yeah it goes through the tea

384
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
yeah it goes through the tea
 

385
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,949
yeah it goes through the tea
the longer one yeah it goes to the

386
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
the longer one yeah it goes to the
 

387
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,110
the longer one yeah it goes to the
longer one what's the space complexity

388
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120

 

389
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,070

one yeah but you say all in first

390
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
one yeah but you say all in first
 

391
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,990
one yeah but you say all in first
okay okay i got you yeah you both are

correct okay
 

395
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,630
correct okay
okay have a look i'm going to erase it

396
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
okay have a look i'm going to erase it
 

397
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,670
okay have a look i'm going to erase it
okay

401
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,870

wait where's the eraser where's the

402
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
wait where's the eraser where's the
 

403
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,790
wait where's the eraser where's the
eraser nowhere

404
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
eraser nowhere
 

405
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:10,700
eraser nowhere
where's the invader can i have it

406
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:10,710

 

407
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:29,190
