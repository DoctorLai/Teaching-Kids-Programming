1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,080
hello

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,080
hello mr eric mr mommy miss mommy

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,240
uh today we talk about

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,240
intervals okay intervals

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,600
so we want to find out we're given a

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,320
list of intervals we want to find out

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,320
the most uh frequent numbers in the

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
range and if there's a tie we need to

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,279
return the smallest number let's give an

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,239
example okay like one to two

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,559
okay let's draw

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,559
draw

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,960
draw a line okay this is x so let's say

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
one to two okay

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,320
this one this is the square bracket

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,840
means

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,960
inclusive right

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
and what's this mean

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,840
what's this

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,600
parentheses

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,760
exclusive remember yeah cheaper yeah

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,840
cheaper you do it like that but what i'm

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,159
talking about is

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,119
well yeah exclusive right

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,560
yeah

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,560
okay so

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,960
we only find uh

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,600
in this giveaway intervals there's only

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,600
one uh integers right we want uh it only

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,200
contains the integer so one two so we

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,479
put it one here two three ah right one

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,600
two so two numbers one two okay and

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,920
okay if this is one three

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,920
three

35
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,360
okay one three

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,560
okay so what's the most frequent number

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,960
in this range one three

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,280
one and two and then as

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,360
we said we want to return the smallest

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,960
number if that's the red time so we

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,399
return one

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,079
got it do you understand this problem

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,560
yeah

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,119
how are we doing this the same thing as

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,520
you did so what i'm doing here good job

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,920
what i'm doing here

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,079
setting on the numbers right and we mark

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,000
we need to mark the counter so look it's

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,479
one two

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,360
so what happened if we want to one two i

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,959
plus one here right right

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
and then i need to plus one here but i

53
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,280
need to minus one uh i i need to restore

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,599
the previous one right

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,200
and then look at one three plus one

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,959
plus one

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,280
plus one okay

58
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,840
so if we use the dictionary right if we

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,319
use the dictionary to remember that

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,319
intervals so what i mean the in

61
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,480
remembering interface is that given the

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,680
start point we said this uh if you

63
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,519
traditionally speak we set a star

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,200
plus equal one

65
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,720
and the end

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,280
and the n plus one look if it's d

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,640
n plus one the endpoint look if it's one

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,040
two and i need to drop to the previous

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,720
previous level we have previous counter

70
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,720
at a three because it doesn't that

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,800
interval does not continue at three we

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,440
need to minus equals one right

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,599
so then if we have uh counters scanning

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,800
if you if we have a line just imagine if

75
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,480
this line

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,519
right sweeping from the left to the

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,480
right and every time we meet

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,519
we increment we accumulate the counter

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,560
right and at this point then we can

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,040
we know

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,319
the number of times that number appears

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,440
ln

83
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,200
number right yeah

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,799
get it do you want me to explain it more

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,080
one more time look

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
so

87
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,319
given this one two one three okay i have

88
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,599
a decision right d1 plus equals one so d

89
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,599
t is a dictionary okay

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
d1

91
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,680
plus equals 1 so 1

92
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,239
1 right

93
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:49,360
t 1 the n is 2 2 plus 1 is three so d3

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,799
minus equals one so three will be minus

95
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,439
equals one right

96
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,159
correct okay one

97
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,239
d1 plus equals one

98
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:03,599
two here right

99
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,840
and d4 right before minus equals one

100
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
right that's the data that's the data

101
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,200
structure and now we go through from the

102
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,760
left to right look and we have a counter

103
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
like c

104
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,400
c added equals two we add the values

105
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,519
here equals two now so you become two

106
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,759
and then

107
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,479
minus one it'll become one

108
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,400
and minus one you'll become one right

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,320
okay so

110
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,479
minus one

111
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,280
oh yeah minus one equals zero okay so

112
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,440
look

113
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,080
here

114
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,080
there are two

115
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,520
what does it mean by two two is the

116
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,360
number of is the numbers that appear on

117
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880
that vertical line right

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,199
right

119
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,240
right so at the beginning is zero so one

120
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,840
would mean two two is the most frequent

121
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,840
most frequent numbers right

122
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,280
so there are numbers appearing

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
twice

124
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,520
so it's one and two here right

125
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,120
and here

126
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,160
if one minus one will be one one here

127
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,320
it means that uh as not as three number

128
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,400
three it only appears once

129
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,800
there's only one number on whatever ones

130
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,960
am right okay

131
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,520
so so we are looking for the maximum

132
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,639
when we when we only see

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,880
so this is turned on offset yeah so

134
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,919
we go through the left to the right we

135
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,000
add it to

136
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,160
we minus one we minus one for the c so c

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,199
will be the

138
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,960
value of the numbers that appear on that

139
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,520
moment okay

140
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,440
so we're looking for the maximum

141
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,080
right if we we meet the maximum we

142
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,360
remember the number at the point and

143
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,199
that would be

144
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,240
the most frequent

145
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,319
number most frequent

146
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,639
and smallest number okay if there's a

147
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,639
type

148
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,120
is it a bit tricky to understand

149
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,360
don't worry i can explain more if you

150
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,000
don't understand

151
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,120
a little bit more right yeah okay that's

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,560
fine look

153
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,560
uh i'm going to

154
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,800
do this again okay look

155
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,319
so

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,759
so let's let's do this here look okay

157
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,440
interval one two another interval one

158
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,360
three

159
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,000
all right

160
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,000
zero here

161
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,400
one

162
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,360
two

163
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
three

164
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,560
four

165
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,120
okay so now

166
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:43,600
d1 this is style i i'm processing this

167
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,160
interval d1 plus equals one

168
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,400
what does that mean if i put the d1 plus

169
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,720
equals one what does it mean plus equals

170
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,759
one it means that at the point at number

171
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,560
one

172
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,039
yeah

173
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,199
we are having a one integer right one

174
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,880
more integer at that interval right

175
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,479
because let's that's what the interval

176
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,840
covers here

177
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,720
right

178
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,120
all right so d1 plus equals one it means

179
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,599
that okay at this point i would go up

180
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,000
the number will go up by one

181
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,680
right and d e plus one look at the

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,960
endpoint plus one it means that d3

183
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,880
at the number three the level will be

184
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,080
restored to the previous so it will be

185
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,240
minus one

186
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,720
right d3

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,680
minus one so let's have this d

188
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,400
subdictionary default dictionary in type

189
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
so

190
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,440
one

191
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,599
the number one

192
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,160
plus equals one will be one

193
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,039
and then d3 will be

194
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,800
three

195
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,599
will be minus one at the beginning is

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,039
zero minus one and then look another

197
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,599
interval d1 plus equals one

198
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,919
yeah so another interval covers this

199
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,360
interval right so d1 plus equal one but

200
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,840
now d3

201
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,000
d4 right three plus equal uh

202
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,319
three actually for these four e plus one

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,680
minus equals one

204
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,560
okay

205
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,680
so and

206
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,360
is here f3 okay so it's d

207
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,840
e one plus equals one that will be

208
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,039
becoming two

209
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,680
and then t3 minus equals one

210
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,960
uh d4 minus equal one four will be minus

211
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,199
one

212
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,479
so this is kind of a change the value is

213
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,479
the change

214
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,599
the key

215
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,840
the key would be the num num number

216
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:33,760
numbers on this assets

217
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,399
and the value will be the change

218
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,120
okay my chain so if i put this change it

219
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,000
will be uneasy to understand right so

220
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,599
so if i have a line sweeping line

221
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,880
sweeping

222
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,880
line sweeping

223
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
if you have a line sweeping from the

224
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,680
left the smallest to the right just

225
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,399
imagine a line sweeping yeah

226
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,440
when we have we we add the change here

227
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,440
at one we change two right

228
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
all right at the beginning is zero and

229
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
at one we change it to two so what does

230
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,320
it mean at this moment

231
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,399
there are two numbers

232
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,399
at least nine moment okay

233
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,640
okay and then i go to three

234
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,600
minus one

235
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,600
so the value will be

236
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,760
one right so what does it mean so at

237
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,360
this point there are only one number

238
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,800
covered

239
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,200
right

240
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,120
which is one one two three display look

241
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,360
at the previous interval one two is gone

242
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,720
it's finished here right

243
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,880
and then i go to four another length

244
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,560
another minus one

245
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,000
what does it mean it becomes zero again

246
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,600
right it means

247
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,399
no numbers

248
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,680
being

249
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,480
covered

250
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,000
being found in the interval

251
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
make sense

252
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,880
now it makes sense yeah okay let's write

253
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,720
the code

254
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,240
so we use the default dictionary

255
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,480
remember what's the

256
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,000
uh what's the

257
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,160
what's the difference between default

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,160
dictionary and an easy dictionary

259
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,040
what's the difference

260
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,320
it has this key thing yeah

261
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,440
this is the key thing so

262
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,760
if the key is not existent in the

263
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,839
default station that's okay the computer

264
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,320
won't screen won't complain you will

265
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,640
just give a default value if the integer

266
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,480
will be zero but if this if this d is

267
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,279
declared like that if there is nothing

268
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,480
here and you say d

269
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,800
one plus equals one

270
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,360
that's a problem because t one

271
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,399
the computer can find d one in the

272
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,480
dictionary right your screen but it's

273
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,880
okay if you if you define additionally

274
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,040
as the default additional integer the

275
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,800
key is not existing at the beginning but

276
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,120
the computer will treat it as zero

277
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,600
before that's what default com comes

278
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,880
into play okay

279
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,880
okay let's do it

280
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,200
define

281
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:14,079
most frequent number yeah most frequent

282
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,519
in the interval let's say interval let's

283
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,000
say

284
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,040
i because i okay

285
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,959
d

286
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,720
equals default

287
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,839
decimal default d right

288
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,320
in

289
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,640
because the value is the change and it's

290
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,640
the integer type

291
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,600
okay then we go through the numbers

292
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880
right

293
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,320
four

294
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,519
star

295
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,079
and

296
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,640
in i okay can you tell me what to do i

297
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,720
write one and you tell me okay d

298
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,680
s

299
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,920
what

300
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,240
d s one

301
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,399
remember the change at this installer

302
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,240
interval we need to go out right

303
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,000
so what what is that

304
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,959
um

305
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,040
go up by one plus equals one where that

306
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,920
plus equals one and then one to the top

307
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,240
t

308
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,600
what minor is equals one t what

309
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,600
um

310
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,399
e

311
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,600
is it dropping an e or the next one

312
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,279
remember look one to two

313
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,800
two still has is the same right but when

314
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:26,079
the three

315
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,079
you'll drop right so it should be d e y

316
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,360
plus plus one yeah next one plus okay

317
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,440
now we have a counter we need to have a

318
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,160
counter which is the

319
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,399
uh we set the most most counter yeah

320
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,600
equals zero at the beginning is zero

321
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,360
yeah

322
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,200
and now we need to go uh have this

323
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,000
answer

324
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,839
answer at the beginning is number right

325
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and then we go to the

326
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,920
sorry it doesn't matter it's numb

327
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,920
because at the beginning yeah

328
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,800
or you can put it as

329
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,200
zero it doesn't matter

330
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,440
okay good job c equals here this is

331
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,680
accumulate right remember we have nine

332
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,440
sweeping from left to right we use the c

333
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,399
to accumulate the answer right now we

334
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,399
need to go through that

335
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,320
go through our conditional so for

336
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,639
what i

337
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,760
in

338
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,200
salted

339
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,680
right we need to salt it sauteed

340
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,279
remember sausage is the key

341
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,519
keys

342
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:34,560
d dot keys right keys

343
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,120
and then i i have to to accumulate c

344
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,560
plus equal

345
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,040
d

346
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,000
i right right

347
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,959
yeah

348
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,519
so this is the number this is the value

349
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,040
the numbers that appearing on that

350
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,040
vertical line right

351
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,279
so now look if

352
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,680
c bigger than most right

353
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,000
what does this mean if we are founding

354
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,079
if we're finding a number which appears

355
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,720
more than the current one right so we

356
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,320
set it most equals to c

357
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,320
i know we need because the first time

358
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,440
from left to right we first time we find

359
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,240
the bigger

360
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,800
uh

361
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,360
more appearing numbers that could be the

362
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,920
answer then we need to update the answer

363
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,839
answer equal

364
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,959
equal one

365
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,680
what what's the number at the time

366
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,680
and then return

367
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,240
what's the time complexity for this one

368
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,120
what's the times on xt

369
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,920
[Music]

370
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,920
what's the something like

371
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,600
what's n

372
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,650
[Music]

373
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,720
yeah the number of intervals the number

374
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,720
of intervals what's the stakes from

375
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,720
christie

376
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,639
make sense

377
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,000
um well

378
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,600
a little bit

379
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,519
yeah so which part you'll not

380
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,920
particularly understand

381
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,040
you do not particularly understand i can

382
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,399
explain

383
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,519
a little bit more

384
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,079
well

385
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,079
i'm fine that's fine so you sure

386
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,120
yeah yeah yeah

387
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,600
i'm going to test you if you're

388
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,600
confident

389
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,320
yeah

390
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,959
that's okay come on okay

391
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,199
okay so look i'm going to

392
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,880
i'm going to do what i'm going to erase

393
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,680
this bit

394
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,120
let's do what should we do here

395
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,639
and

396
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,600
what should we do here

397
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,880
okay so there are two parts

398
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,040
here

399
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,600
and here okay do you want to come over

400
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,600
and write it up

401
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,519
okay

402
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,800
remember remember i have a

403
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,959
interval here right zero one two three

404
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,560
so what happens if we have a line

405
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,800
sweeping from the left to the right um

406
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,800
yeah

407
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,040
plus equal one

408
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,880
and then one two yeah star for example

409
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,639
is here and what happens when we need to

410
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,199
go back to

411
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,199
the ui

412
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
yeah

413
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,880
what

414
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,880
one

415
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,279
and then we need to accumulate have a

416
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,360
line sweeping i'm here have a line

417
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,959
sweeping from left to right and every

418
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,639
time

419
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,920
we

420
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,240
stall the chance so we have a c which is

421
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,480
like represent the current yeah yeah c

422
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,040
1. um we need to add a change right

423
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,480
at equal

424
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,880
at equal

425
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,839
which is the change i is the numbers i

426
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,520
know what change is available and what

427
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,880
what are you doing here you stole the

428
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,240
change here

429
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,880
so what

430
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,480
d b

431
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,640
what yeah yeah

432
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,640
yeah

433
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,959
i

434
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,559
okay that's it good job today good job

435
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,559
good job bye
