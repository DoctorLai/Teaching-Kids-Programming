1
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,699
[Music]

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,260
so we are given a list of the integers

3
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:38,719
uh a list of single digits like one two

4
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:42,800
you know we could have a duplication

5
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:46,680
so our task is to find all okay

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,440
or three digit number

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,600
which is also even right and it does not

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,820
have relieving zeros okay I do not have

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,039
a living kilos for example

10
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,840
one two two three zero

11
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:04,260
so what we can have is one two two

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,960
zero right and one three one two one

13
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,780
zero three one two three yeah yeah so

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,880
all these three digit even numbers do

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,119
not have leading zeros and has to be

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,159
sorted in the uh distance in a returned

17
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,380
array okay yes and then we talk about

18
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,380
two masters one method is to

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:28,799
basically this is just to permutate

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:33,240
three digits out of this end we

21
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,759
permutate this pn3 picking three out of

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,460
n digits and then once we have this

23
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,320
commutation we need to check if the even

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,900
number it does not have a leading zero

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,900
and then we need to add it to the set

26
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,640
right

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,540
okay so why do we need the set do you

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,640
remember

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,740
so you don't want the duplicate right so

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,299
that's why we use the set okay so why

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,860
are you using set because we don't want

32
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,659
to install the duplicates uh we only

33
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,579
want that you need the numbers and then

34
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,680
before we return we need to sort it

35
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,600
right the time connects to your sorting

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,659
is over and again and that permutation

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,459
is pn3 this is the time complexity and

38
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,959
the space and complexity obviously if

39
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:15,000
all the numbers if all the numbers are

40
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:19,020
unique and even digits for example if we

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,440
have an array of 2 4 6A right

42
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,319
and then the full permutation every

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,959
possibility every commutation of three

44
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:33,060
digits is a good answer and we need to

45
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,680
add it to the results and that takes pm3

46
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,660
space

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,060
but this is not efficient right one

48
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,180
efficient way the more efficient way is

49
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,500
to get to iterate cancer

50
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,959
yeah

51
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,480
so we want to prove us because they are

52
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:53,220
limited number of three digits right so

53
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:56,040
we proof of we try each even number we

54
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,879
seen this ring we try basically we are

55
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,879
saying that we try every three digit

56
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,879
even number and to see if it can be made

57
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,220
from the given digits right and how do

58
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,560
we determine if it can be made out of

59
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,080
this given array of digits we just use

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,480
the counter we count the number of the

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,760
appearance for each digit and then we

62
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,000
compare two counters

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,920
if the counter of these digits the even

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,459
number three digit even number is

65
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,040
smaller than the given counter then we

66
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,500
say it's possible to make these three

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,780
digit even number using those digits

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,000
right and this is more efficient because

69
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,879
look this is a constant Loop we just

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,459
have to iterate how many times you know

71
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,459
how many even numbers of three digits

72
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,420
minus 100 divided by two

73
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,879
I need to plus one this is the number of

74
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,739
the three digit even numbers this is a

75
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,580
constant number so this is a constant

76
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,459
Loop

77
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,200
constant time complexity if this is not

78
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,640
considered okay if we are not

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,159
considering the

80
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,200
time complexity of turning the digit

81
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,360
into account least bit we're just

82
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,640
talking about this this bit as this

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,640
constant of we talk about this we don't

84
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,019
use this from ether tools import

85
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,400
permutation right and at least gives us

86
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,960
a nice uh easy to use tool to to do this

87
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,479
permutation

88
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,639
of three digit and this is the iterated

89
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,880
but basically we're saying that

90
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,180
we want to find a permutation of three

91
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,040
digits based on these digits given right

92
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,440
and then we check if it doesn't have a

93
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,979
leading zero if it's an even number last

94
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,520
digit is the even number then we add it

95
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:50,040
a this is 100 P this is the 10 see this

96
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,740
is once I learned

97
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,720
answer is a set this is to prevent the

98
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,580
duplicate numbers and then at the end we

99
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,479
need to sort it all right sorry this is

100
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:04,500
om log m n is pn3 so okay so the time

101
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,880
for next is pn3 this bit

102
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:12,380
plus right plus plus

103
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:16,620
p uh N3 Times log p and z Oh this is the

104
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:19,440
n log n right and as I said n equals p

105
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,479
and three I mentioned the paper search

106
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,340
prefer search we can solve this using

107
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,320
type of search and in the next lesson we

108
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,180
are solving this using professors okay

109
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,240
what's the difference between defenses

110
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,919
and Professor anybody

111
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,199
searching good level by level but

112
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,300
deficit you go deep as you can that's

113
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,259
right and how do we get there

114
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,139
uses stack and breakfast at Jesus key

115
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,880
good man okay so

116
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,400
what are we trying to do with the

117
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,199
deficit here right we are trying to

118
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,660
implement this communication right we

119
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,060
want three digits even number and this

120
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,320
is from the mathematics perspective we

121
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,419
want to find out the three digit

122
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,639
communication using the deficit

123
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,160
suppose we have this digit right how do

124
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,280
we do this switch patient anybody what

125
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:10,139
are those possible Communications

126
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:13,199
um one two one two two and one two three

127
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,699
one two three no no no yeah yeah one two

128
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,199
three yeah that's okay forget about it

129
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,000
even number I'm just saying the three

130
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,880
digit permutation how to do it one two

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,699
three okay it's enough one two zero here

132
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,460
right so that long right we want to find

133
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,560
out a three-digit permutation using the

134
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,360
number of digits given right so we can

135
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,280
do this step as such and how do we use

136
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,780
the default search let's do this deficit

137
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,520
first of all we need to counter I

138
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,220
counted the digits right we need to

139
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,300
obviously notice the frequency C equals

140
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,699
counter

141
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,060
counter digit

142
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:49,139
okay and then Define self massage let's

143
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:52,500
say the current number is X right and if

144
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:55,259
X is bigger than 99 or bigger or equal

145
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,160
than 100 it means that it's a three

146
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:01,620
digit number right if x and y equal

147
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,740
equal if it's an even number right

148
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,139
answer equals that we just put it in a

149
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,780
set answer dot add X

150
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,940
right and then we ten if we have already

151
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,340
three digits if it's an even number we

152
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:19,380
add it to the answer if not we'll do 10

153
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:22,199
okay and then for I in range

154
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,500
10 right we're going through each digit

155
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,060
0 1 2 3 4 5 up to nine and then we check

156
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,139
if

157
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,419
this c c i if we have enough digit of I

158
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,699
this is the counting how many digits of

159
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,160
the features we are given right if it's

160
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,300
bigger than zero let me do this step

161
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,000
massage

162
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,180
okay so I'm gonna put it here and then

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,060
if it's bigger than Seattle

164
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,620
but I have to c i minus equals one and

165
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,680
then c i

166
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,900
plus equal one right and then here this

167
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,020
is the sun return sorting

168
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,880
sorted answer one thing is missing here

169
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,620
this one

170
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,319
that's a search

171
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,720
we have this x this is the traveling

172
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,060
number right it could be one it could be

173
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,860
two at the beginning is zero okay we

174
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,680
don't have enough digits here so we go

175
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,979
to here and we try each

176
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,160
digits from 0 to 9.

177
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:22,740
look if c i is bigger than zero it means

178
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,080
that original number we have enough

179
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,340
digit from zero to nine right zero to

180
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,220
nine times zero

181
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,640
so zero this is turning it into counter

182
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:36,000
is zero one time one one time two two

183
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,099
times three one time right okay so zero

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,140
we have one time that's good

185
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:43,260
it's bigger than zero we're using this

186
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,480
ZL right so we take it we take it take

187
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,920
this material and we turn it into zero

188
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,519
right and then with that first search

189
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,680
current number X so x times ten

190
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,260
class I

191
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,300
so what does it mean means that look if

192
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,399
his current number is one two right and

193
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,519
I'm taking another three right one two

194
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:04,860
so I'm taking the digit three I equals

195
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,519
three so what's X

196
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:11,940
one two times ten plus three it becomes

197
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,920
one two three okay yeah and after we do

198
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,140
this recursion we have to

199
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,480
give it back give the teacher back I get

200
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,420
back right make sense do we talk about

201
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,580
the maze problem remember we mark it and

202
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:27,600
we need to unmark it

203
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:30,060
okay we follow the digit I here look at

204
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,220
we are checking the digit from zero zero

205
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,740
one two three two up to nine then we say

206
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,160
okay if we have enough digit C remember

207
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,200
C is the counter of original if we have

208
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,380
enough digit of I

209
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,060
then we follow it c i minus equal one we

210
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,519
follow it and we do the test as such

211
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,220
after we do the research we do we turn

212
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,260
it we give it back right so how do we do

213
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,600
the deficiency this is the location

214
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,000
current number is X Y for example is X

215
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,180
is 12. and we want to

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,660
follow the digit three right so what

217
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,360
happened to the number I have 12. and I

218
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,300
want to put a three on the right what

219
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,459
happened to this x so now X is 12 right

220
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,500
I've tried two digits now I need one

221
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:16,500
more digit the three I have enough three

222
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,120
so I can put a three on the right hand

223
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,519
side of the one two so what happened to

224
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,800
this x it becomes old

225
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,959
yeah I know but you know when the X

226
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,660
passing here if you go to real because

227
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,800
it's bigger than 99 it's 36 right so

228
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:34,800
here so what happened if x equals 12

229
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,200
and then I borrow a number three digit

230
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,000
three put it put it on on the right so

231
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,760
what happened to this X

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,620
it's very obvious one two and what

233
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,519
happened

234
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,920
um if it gets free it becomes 120 yeah

235
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,459
so it means that look at 12 times 10

236
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,040
here right times that means 12 times 10

237
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:58,200
it means that I I put I want to put one

238
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,160
digit on the right and then plus three

239
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,160
okay

240
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,160
search

241
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,480
make sense yep

242
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,640
so we need to give you back right if we

243
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,079
don't give it back then the digital will

244
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,560
be running out and then there's some

245
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:17,399
solution will be missing okay yeah which

246
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,959
line of code says is commutation of

247
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,060
three digits

248
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,850
from where you can see it's a three

249
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,960
digit permutation

250
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,960
[Music]

251
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:34,140
99 means the the only is three digits

252
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,380
and it's three digit here there will be

253
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,380
a return

254
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,800
so that maximum digit is three digit

255
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,540
it's not possible to get four digits

256
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,000
using this right because after three

257
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,740
digits we do ten we don't do the

258
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,899
recursion anymore right this is the

259
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,820
terminal case right and at the beginning

260
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,620
we call that first search you know at

261
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,019
the beginning we have nothing and then

262
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,260
you will try each digit okay

263
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,680
and which part of code says that it's an

264
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,680
even number

265
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,240
um

266
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,399
if x is

267
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,060
which part of code says uh is less

268
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,060
notification

269
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,260
is accepted yeah okay

270
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,440
okay unique digit for example a equals

271
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,959
set

272
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:34,019
by a DOT add one okay so a DOT at

273
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,120
two a DOT add

274
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,360
three okay one

275
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,320
a is one right contains one a DOT add

276
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,360
two so one two so a DOT S three one two

277
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,300
three okay so how about eight dot add

278
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,600
three what happens a is a set of one two

279
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:54,060
three right one two three I want to add

280
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,200
one more three into the set what

281
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,260
happened

282
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,779
set Only Stores unique numbers and if I

283
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,519
have one two three already in a set and

284
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,920
I want to add one more three to the set

285
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,500
nothing will happen you can add as many

286
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,079
numbers in it but you only stores one

287
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,680
two three and that's it right okay this

288
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,420
is the one that set is okay

289
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,760
and which part of curve guarantees the

290
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,820
answer is sorted

291
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,680
um yeah that's an easy one right okay so

292
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,920
what have you learned today about the

293
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,740
same as yesterday fighting finding three

294
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,800
digit even numbers what what's the new

295
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:35,700
today we use that for such yes what's

296
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,700
the time complexity uh

297
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,300
yeah this is the permutation this means

298
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,880
picking three digits out of entity

299
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,579
what's the difference between pm3 and

300
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,820
cn3 okay one last question anybody pm3

301
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:53,040
is like it's like picking three apples

302
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,500
out and apples and what's the difference

303
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,440
between p and C and C and C okay let's

304
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,000
say p three two and C32 what's the

305
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,800
difference right so yeah plus one two

306
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,800
three okay one two three

307
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:11,239
is one of them kind of like

308
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,239
[Music]

309
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:23,660
give us

310
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,660
so yeah for picking two what are those

311
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,180
what are those

312
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,339
see the way you see is um

313
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:45,720
whatever is a bacteria and C is she is

314
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:49,320
like how much possibilities he can pick

315
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,220
from the bottom one and and the third

316
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,880
one is how much okay

317
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:59,360
you can pick and and you just need to um

318
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,160
see how much possibilities

319
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,079
I'm trying to understand what it says

320
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,279
[Music]

321
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,279
it got me confused

322
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,860
is

323
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,180
like

324
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:17,699
instead of like the picking it is

325
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,920
putting the numbers like

326
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:21,199
but I didn't remember like one two one

327
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,880
three

328
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,940
Okay so

329
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,940
yeah

330
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:35,160
and obviously obviously one is how much

331
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,839
how much is the popularity and and two

332
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,899
is it how much you have

333
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:42,060
I have to pick basically they're pretty

334
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,339
similar instead of seeds doesn't really

335
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,740
care about the numbers and and you can

336
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:53,399
use anything like apples or apples or

337
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:56,160
bananas and yum no PNG numbers

338
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,579
it says like one three one two one

339
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,579
million

340
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:08,220
okay see see combination for picking two

341
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,820
apples how many ways how many ways yeah

342
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,820
how many ways

343
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,440
c one two is the same as two one right

344
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,380
but P one two is different than two one

345
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,100
okay that's what's the difference C is

346
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,779
this speed p is both ended up together

347
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,920
okay

348
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:47,100
there was a p32 is one two two one one

349
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,079
three three one two three three two c is

350
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,600
one two one three two three right

351
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:55,019
combination without considering the

352
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,259
order all the order doesn't matter P

353
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:00,000
commutation full permutation yeah one

354
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:02,339
two three one three two this is

355
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,559
permutation right two one three two

356
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:06,780
three one three one two three two one

357
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,179
look full formulation and exact earlier

358
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,040
yeah we talk about that okay yep

359
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,600
everyone you talk about it too that I

360
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,059
would say listen to you for like five

361
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,860
minutes before I figure out your kind of

362
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:19,860
like jumping right good job okay see you

363
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:22,520
later bye bye bye

364
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,520
