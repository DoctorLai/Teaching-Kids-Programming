yeah it's like a is a and b are the size
 

75
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,270
yeah it's like a is a and b are the size
of the right triangle and the c is the

76
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
of the right triangle and the c is the
 

77
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,550
of the right triangle and the c is the
big largest side yeah look at it

78
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
big largest side yeah look at it
 

79
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,749

yeah this is the slow uh

80
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
yeah this is the slow uh
 

81
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,310
yeah this is the slow uh
slope okay so you need you know in the

82

34 is not a square so

178
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
34 is not a square so
 

179
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,390
34 is not a square so
you go do the next one so you approve

180
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
you go do the next one so you approve
 

181
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,430
you go do the next one so you approve
four things yeah you're

182
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
four things yeah you're
 

183
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,909
four things yeah you're
searching every three numbers yeah yes

184
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
searching every three numbers yeah yes
 

185
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,749
searching every three numbers yeah yes
okay so one way

186
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
okay so one way
 

187
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,670
okay so one way
is that yeah you can certainly do it you

188
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
is that yeah you can certainly do it you
 

189
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,790
is that yeah you can certainly do it you
pick the first number

190
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
pick the first number
 

191
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,909
pick the first number
yeah and then you pick the second number

192
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
yeah and then you pick the second number
 

193
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,629
yeah and then you pick the second number
yeah and you try the third number if

194
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
yeah and you try the third number if
 

195
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,390
yeah and you try the third number if
it's equal right

196
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
it's equal right
 

197
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,909
it's equal right
if it's so you can simply do this look

198
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
if it's so you can simply do this look
 

199
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,110
if it's so you can simply do this look
all right look

200
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
all right look
 

201
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,629
all right look
for i in

202
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
for i in
 

203
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,950
for i in
suppose n is the length of numbers yeah

204
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
suppose n is the length of numbers yeah
 

205
00:04:50,960 --> 00:05:01,189
suppose n is the length of numbers yeah
am i range lamp

206
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199

 

207
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,070

now we determine the first number yeah

208
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
now we determine the first number yeah
 

209
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,350
now we determine the first number yeah
look now we can see

210
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
look now we can see
 

211
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,189
look now we can see
the second number j e range

212
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
the second number j e range
 

213
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,230
the second number j e range
we we only need to try after i yeah

214
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
we we only need to try after i yeah
 

215
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,350
we we only need to try after i yeah
yes

219
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,310

to j right and now we just need to check

220
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
to j right and now we just need to check
 

221
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,270

number which they are not equal and what

246
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
number which they are not equal and what
 

247
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,870
number which they are not equal and what
i can say

248
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:50,880
i can say
 

249
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,029
i can say
loves i squared plus num j squared

can we do better how about look
 

307
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,589
can we do better how about look
i give her nothing how about look look

308
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
i give her nothing how about look look

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
we just interested in
 

311
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,749
we just interested in
first two numbers and then we can find

312
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
first two numbers and then we can find
 

313
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,909
first two numbers and then we can find
out if the

314
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
out if the
 

315
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,350
out if the
i squared plus j square the first two

316
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360

that's something how about we

320
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
that's something how about we
 

321
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,629
that's something how about we
we put these something c-square in

322
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
we put these something c-square in
 

323
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,029
we put these something c-square in
a notebook so then we can look it up

324
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
a notebook so then we can look it up
 

325
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,070
a notebook so then we can look it up
with constant time

326
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
with constant time
 

327
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,270
with constant time
do you get it look we can do this we can

328
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
do you get it look we can do this we can
 

329
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,950
do you get it look we can do this we can
do this

look we can do this look uh
 

333
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,430
look we can do this look uh
alright let's do it d equals a set

334
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
alright let's do it d equals a set
 

335
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,710
alright let's do it d equals a set
yeah what's that yeah a notebook

yeah what's that yeah a notebook
 

337
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,830
yeah what's that yeah a notebook
okay let's put it in notebook like

338
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
okay let's put it in notebook like
 

339
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,070
okay let's put it in notebook like

first yeah fine
 

445
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,590
first yeah fine
now reverse equals true

446
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
now reverse equals true

yeah i saw the number in reverse order
 

455
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,590
yeah i saw the number in reverse order
so i saw the number in from the largest

456
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
so i saw the number in from the largest
 

457
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,350
so i saw the number in from the largest

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,030

now if i make sure the j

488
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
now if i make sure the j
 

489
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,350
now if i make sure the j
will be i plus one okay if i i if i

490
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
will be i plus one okay if i i if i
 

491
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,230
will be i plus one okay if i i if i
i check this is the first number okay if

492
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:00,240
i check this is the first number okay if
 

493
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,590
i check this is the first number okay if
this is a

494
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
this is a
 

495
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,030
this is a
column yeah look if this is a

496
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
column yeah look if this is a
 

497
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,829
column yeah look if this is a
and i start from here this is b okay and

498
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
and i start from here this is b okay and
 

499
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,710
and i start from here this is b okay and
then

500
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
then
 

501
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,750
then
look every time i make sure this is a

502
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
look every time i make sure this is a
 

503
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,590
look every time i make sure this is a
and then b will be a plus one

504
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
and then b will be a plus one
 

505
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,870
and then b will be a plus one
c will from this side okay

506
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
c will from this side okay
 

507
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,550
c will from this side okay
so i check if a square equals b squared

508
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
so i check if a square equals b squared
 

509
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,069
so i check if a square equals b squared
plus c square if it is

510
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
plus c square if it is
 

511
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,910
plus c square if it is
that's great we find this number okay

512
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
that's great we find this number okay
 

513
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,430
that's great we find this number okay
right if b

514
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
right if b
 

515
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,629
right if b
squared plus c squared is smaller than

516
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
squared plus c squared is smaller than
 

517
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,629
squared plus c squared is smaller than
a square so

518
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
a square so
 

519
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,949
a square so
what should we move we should move c

520
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
what should we move we should move c
 

521
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,069
what should we move we should move c
here or move b

522
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
here or move b
 

523
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,949
here or move b
here because they're sorted here do you

524
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
here because they're sorted here do you
 

525
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,030
here because they're sorted here do you
get it

526
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
get it
 

527
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,269
get it
i i tried to explain one more time okay

528
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
i i tried to explain one more time okay
 

529
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,710
i i tried to explain one more time okay
this is the tricky

530
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
this is the tricky
 

531
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,550
this is the tricky
now a i'm i i make an assumption that

532
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
now a i'm i i make an assumption that
 

533
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,990
now a i'm i i make an assumption that
a is seven yeah yeah okay now b

534
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
a is seven yeah yeah okay now b
 

535
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,829
a is seven yeah yeah okay now b
is next to a c is at the end

536
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
is next to a c is at the end
 

537
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,350
is next to a c is at the end
right so now i check b square is 25

538
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:01,360
right so now i check b square is 25
 

539
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,550
right so now i check b square is 25
plus c squared is six so that's 20

540
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
plus c squared is six so that's 20
 

541
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,990
plus c squared is six so that's 20
uh 25 plus 1 is 26

542
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
uh 25 plus 1 is 26
 

543
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,470
uh 25 plus 1 is 26
7 square is 49 26 is smaller than 20

544
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
7 square is 49 26 is smaller than 20
 

545
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,110
7 square is 49 26 is smaller than 20
49 right yes yes

546
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
49 right yes yes
 

547
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,990
49 right yes yes
so should i move here see see because if

548
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
so should i move here see see because if
 

549
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,990
so should i move here see see because if
i move here that will be smaller right

550
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
i move here that will be smaller right
 

551
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,949
i move here that will be smaller right
you'll keep smaller so i move here okay

552
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
you'll keep smaller so i move here okay
 

553
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,069
you'll keep smaller so i move here okay
great

554
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
great
 

555
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,430
great
c square 9 plus 25

556
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
c square 9 plus 25
 

557
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,190
c square 9 plus 25
9 plus 25 34 it's still smaller then i

558
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
9 plus 25 34 it's still smaller then i
 

559
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,350
9 plus 25 34 it's still smaller then i
keep moving until i meet yeah let's see

560
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360

answer okay
now we can't find this answer then we

572
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
now we can't find this answer then we
 

573
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,509
now we can't find this answer then we
move a here

574
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
move a here
 

575
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,710
move a here
okay and then b will be here right yeah

576
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
okay and then b will be here right yeah
 

577
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,590
okay and then b will be here right yeah
c will be here at the end yeah

578
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600

i know uh c

586
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,560
i know uh c
 

587
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,949
i know uh c
yes i move here and i check okay when we

588
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
yes i move here and i check okay when we
 

589
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,310
yes i move here and i check okay when we
got it do you get it

590
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
got it do you get it
 

591
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,110
got it do you get it
if it's bigger then we move the b right

592
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120
if it's bigger then we move the b right
 

593
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,750
if it's bigger then we move the b right
because b

594
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,760
because b
 

595
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,670
because b
one b moving to the right will be

596
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
one b moving to the right will be
 

597
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,870
one b moving to the right will be
smaller b

598
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880

squared plus c square will be smaller do

600
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040

that so we need to move the
k right right k y

676
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
k right right k y
 

677
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,509
k right right k y
okay minus one minus equals one okay

678
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
okay minus one minus equals one okay
 

679
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:43,030
okay minus one minus equals one okay
that's what else we're

680
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,040

 

681
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,710

okay so where do you put the return

682
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
okay so where do you put the return
 

683
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,230
okay so where do you put the return
first where do you put the little phone

684
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
first where do you put the little phone
 

685
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,110
first where do you put the little phone
here

686
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
here
 

687
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,829
here
i would say okay oh wait

688
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839

 

689
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,749

remember where's four you need to write

690
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
remember where's four you need to write
 

691
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,310
remember where's four you need to write
where

692
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,320

 

693
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,030

here here yeah outside that's what i am

694
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040
here here yeah outside that's what i am
 

695
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,069
here here yeah outside that's what i am
yeah return first

696
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
yeah return first
 

697
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,269
yeah return first
yeah that's why i do it really without

698
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
yeah that's why i do it really without
 

699
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:03,590
yeah that's why i do it really without
that

700
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
that
 

701
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,870
that
give you the hint can you do it return

702
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
give you the hint can you do it return
 

703
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,110
give you the hint can you do it return
first

704
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
first
 

705
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,789
first
okay like lie down like

706
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
okay like lie down like
 

707
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,990
okay like lie down like
daddy okay okay

708
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
daddy okay okay
 

709
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,470
daddy okay okay
you need the caterpillar

710
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480

 

711
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,549

okay that's it okay good job okay what's

712
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
okay that's it okay good job okay what's
 

713
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,829
okay that's it okay good job okay what's
the time complexity

714
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
the time complexity
 

715
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,549
the time complexity
i i i i i i i

716
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
i i i i i i i
 

717
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,310
i i i i i i i
this is for n right and here

718
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
this is for n right and here
 

719
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,669
this is for n right and here
is another n right and the n

720
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
is another n right and the n
 

721
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,310
is another n right and the n
yeah how about this here sorting

722
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
yeah how about this here sorting
 

723
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,590
yeah how about this here sorting
remember we talked about

724
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
remember we talked about
 

725
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,230
remember we talked about
wait wait no yes we talk about the

726
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
wait wait no yes we talk about the
 

727
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,470
wait wait no yes we talk about the
salting this one

728
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:48,480
salting this one
 

729
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,470
salting this one
this is outside so these complexities

730
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
this is outside so these complexities
 

731
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,909
this is outside so these complexities
should be this one plus this one yeah

732
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
should be this one plus this one yeah
 

733
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,110
should be this one plus this one yeah
yeah look at it so we can you know make

734
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
yeah look at it so we can you know make
 

735
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,990
yeah look at it so we can you know make
a mess here

736
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
a mess here
 

737
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,029
a mess here
so this one is all and log

738
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
so this one is all and log
 

739
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,150
so this one is all and log
n okay yeah okay

740
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
n okay yeah okay
 

741
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,110
n okay yeah okay
yeah sorting l and l so the overall

742
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
yeah sorting l and l so the overall
 

743
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,870
yeah sorting l and l so the overall
complexity look at that two parts

744
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
complexity look at that two parts
 

745
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,390
complexity look at that two parts
this one is o and not n

746
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400

 

747
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,350

and this bit is all n square so which

748
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
and this bit is all n square so which
 

749
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,470
and this bit is all n square so which
one you think is

750
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
one you think is
 

751
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,070
one you think is
bigger it's dominating

752
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
bigger it's dominating
 

753
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,190
bigger it's dominating
this is n times n and this is n times

754
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
this is n times n and this is n times
 

755
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,909
this is n times n and this is n times
log n

756
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
log n
 

757
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,870
log n
so which one you think is dominating n

758
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
so which one you think is dominating n
 

759
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,270
so which one you think is dominating n
times

760
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
times
 

761
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,590
times
n yeah n times n log n is smaller than n

762
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
n yeah n times n log n is smaller than n
 

763
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,630
n yeah n times n log n is smaller than n
right yeah so this one is documenting so

764
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:36,640
right yeah so this one is documenting so
 

765
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,110
right yeah so this one is documenting so

the most dominant part we are not saying
the complexities

774
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
the complexities
 

775
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,029
the complexities
of and log n plus n plus n times

776
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
of and log n plus n plus n times
 

777
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,510
of and log n plus n plus n times
we only say okay this overall complexity

778
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
we only say okay this overall complexity
 

779
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,870
we only say okay this overall complexity
is o n square

780
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
is o n square
 

781
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,190
is o n square
even there's a small bit sorting here is

782
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
even there's a small bit sorting here is
 

783
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,310
even there's a small bit sorting here is
o and log n

784
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320
o and log n
 

785
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,430
o and log n
we ignore it because this one dominating

786
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
we ignore it because this one dominating
 

787
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,470
we ignore it because this one dominating
do you get it

788
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
do you get it
 

789
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,029
do you get it
this one takes most of the time and this

790
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
this one takes most of the time and this
 

791
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,950
this one takes most of the time and this
one can be ignored

792
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
one can be ignored
 

793
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,070
one can be ignored
compared to this look at it yeah

794
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
compared to this look at it yeah
 

795
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,990
compared to this look at it yeah
so the complexity is this one what's the

796
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
so the complexity is this one what's the
 

797
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,240
so the complexity is this one what's the
space complexity
