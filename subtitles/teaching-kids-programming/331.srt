1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
hello mr are you all right

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,160
yes

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,919
okay so we talk about the golden ratio

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,720
golden ratio

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,519
gold

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,480
and ratio

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:19,439
and it's represented by a greek letter

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,320
which is uh like that yeah five

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,560
d

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,400
yeah five okay five something like that

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,519
five

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,000
so it is defined as look if we have a

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,920
line segment and the bigger one is a the

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
smaller one is b

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,800
right and the sum is a plus b the ratio

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,399
between the big the sum to the bigger

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,320
one

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,800
is equals the bigger one

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,520
divided by the smaller one right

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,520
right this is generation if we if we set

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,800
p equals 1 and a is the goal generation

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,879
okay

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,239
so let's try to solve this then we can

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,360
multiply this yeah so a square

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,480
a square

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,199
equals

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,399
a plus b times b

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,680
right and this is what a b plus b

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,799
squared right

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,439
because we said b equals one so a square

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,560
equals a plus one right

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,360
if we move these two to the other side

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,119
so what a square minus a minus one

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,360
equals zero

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,200
quadratic function we know there are

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,920
there are two roots right two roots for

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,640
each cognitive function

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,159
equation and look if so the quadratic

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,079
function is what

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,159
if uh for ax squared plus bx plus c

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,840
equals zero we have two roots which is

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,280
two times a

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
minus b

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,399
plus minus

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
b square minus 4ac

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,520
okay

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
yeah

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,880
okay so look if we substitute look at

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:55,680
this a is 1 right if a is what so that's

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:59,520
2 times minus d which is 1

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,280
plus minus b square which is 1 minus

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,399
from negative 4 which is 5.

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,240
right and then

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,360
because we want the positive we are

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,920
positive the value so we could just plug

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,280
in these values that would be

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
this is the

58
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,120
golden ratio which is approximately this

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,120
one this value again 1.618

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,360
yeah that's

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,360
this one uh

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,319
so last time we talked about fibonacci

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,800
number yeah

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,840
the first two numbers zero one and the

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,920
next few numbers is

66
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,440
what is the sum of the previous two

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,760
terms

68
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,760
right

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,640
35

70
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,560
56 91

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,040
and what's that 147

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,040
okay and then we add one more which is

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,040
238

74
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,080
okay

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,560
so look if this one is b this is a and

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,120
this is what b plus a

77
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,879
right if this is b this is a this is b

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,280
plus a right

79
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,400
so if because this fibonacci number goes

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,959
infinity right so when this goes

81
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,519
forever forever forever the ratio

82
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,040
between two terms consecutive two terms

83
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,000
right is a

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,560
a divided by b would be y

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,799
a plus b divided by a okay look what's

86
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,799
there

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,599
golden ratio yeah we just define it

88
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,640
so let us try to just try a few terms

89
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,599
okay let's try to calculate this number

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,440
okay and then this number

91
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,040
okay i'm going to use the calculator

92
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,760
okay

93
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,280
let me use the calculator

94
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,080
147

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,920
divided by 91

96
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,120
is

97
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,640
1.615 okay

98
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,680
1.615 and then this one

99
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,799
238 divided by

100
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,519
147 is

101
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,799
1.618 okay it's very close to 1.618

102
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,519
right

103
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:18,720
remember this golden ratio is 1.618

104
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,840
it's a irrational number equation

105
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
the

106
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,479
rational number

107
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,560
a relation amount is a fraction that

108
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,440
cannot be represented by

109
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,639
by p divided by q where p and q are

110
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,759
integer right

111
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,880
like this square root of 2

112
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,880
pi this is all these are all irrational

113
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,400
numbers but like

114
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,160
20 divided by 3 this is a

115
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,800
rational number right because these two

116
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,800
are integer

117
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,840
so we can write the

118
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,919
we can introduce another mathematics

119
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
way to write the limit

120
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,919
to to calculate

121
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,360
the number which has uh you know

122
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,240
infinitive

123
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,680
right

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,039
uh look we can do this limit

125
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,400
when n

126
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,800
approach

127
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,840
how do you write the infinity

128
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
write down

129
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,800
lie down a okay

130
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,240
by the way another facebook yeah

131
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,479
facebook changed the logo to meta you

132
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,520
know facebook yeah

133
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,880
the change is located to this

134
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,400
yeah

135
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,759
so look we can say f n plus 1 divided by

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,199
f n

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,600
all right because this is important

138
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,600
number the next term n plus n plus one

139
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,199
and

140
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,560
a fibonacci number divided by its

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,120
previous term this will be equal to 5

142
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,479
equals to 5

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,800
and which is approximately

144
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,800
1.618 okay

145
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,039
make sense

146
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,479
okay and then we we also talked about uh

147
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,240
different ways of calculating the

148
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,440
fibonacci number right at least you know

149
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,800
two right one is using the recursion

150
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,280
if if n equals zero return one

151
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
and return zero if n equals one return

152
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,759
one

153
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,680
else return f n minus one plus f n minus

154
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,960
two right and we are using the cache

155
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,280
function

156
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,600
to avoid repeating calculating the

157
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,720
intermediate numbers and we can also use

158
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,479
it using iterative number right for i

159
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,400
uh we can just for

160
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,199
for i in range

161
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,520
n

162
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,880
a b equals b

163
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,880
a plus b okay

164
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,199
so this golden ratio we just talked

165
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,600
about because look is is x square minus

166
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,680
is basically the root of x s square

167
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,080
minus x plus uh minus one equals zero

168
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,240
okay it's the least and how about if i

169
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,639
say if okay if i put a two here

170
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,120
okay so we're going to introduce a new

171
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,880
sequence which is is called another

172
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,440
golden golden

173
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,400
golden and what's next to golden

174
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,919
the matter the matter here

175
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,319
method what's matter

176
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,080
yeah we're done good and silver

177
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,080
so today siwa ratio

178
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,400
so mata yeah and golden shiva what's

179
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,560
next

180
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,360
bones or copper yeah sometimes copper

181
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
you know the copper

182
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,680
yeah so that's silver silver so when

183
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,199
this is two

184
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,199
and copper are grounds

185
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,440
when this is three so look s square

186
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:48,639
minus n x minus one equals zero

187
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:51,440
this is called meta meta ratio equation

188
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:56,160
method ratio equation so when n equals

189
00:07:51,440 --> 00:08:00,319
one then let's do it will be golden

190
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,199
when n is two that will be c one

191
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,919
when n equals three i don't know cooper

192
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,520
or bronze okay

193
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,919
yeah

194
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,840
yeah we already start a lot right or is

195
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,840
it golden this is fibonacci number

196
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,039
yeah so look it's very beautiful right

197
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,800
because fibonacci number contains the

198
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,319
golden ratio right

199
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,560
make sense

200
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,520
how about this receiver if we if we have

201
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,960
these two so

202
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,560
so look

203
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,360
f square

204
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,479
minus 2 x minus 1 so what's the root of

205
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,159
it

206
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,360
2 times a

207
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,640
which is 1 2 2 minus b

208
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,880
which is what

209
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,080
okay maybe we can just solve this look

210
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,040
if x squared minus n x minus one equals

211
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,040
zero what's the root

212
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,399
what's the root two times a what's a

213
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,279
what's the height yeah

214
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,880
is

215
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,560
one right one

216
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,160
two times a

217
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,279
minus b minus b which is n right

218
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,480
plus

219
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,920
minus

220
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,839
one

221
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,839
b squared b squared is n squared

222
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,360
minus 4 times a so plus 1 y

223
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,880
right this is a so basically for this

224
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,560
equation

225
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,760
a is 1

226
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,120
b is

227
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,279
minus and

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
c is minus one okay

229
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,120
and now we can just substitute remember

230
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,680
that the formula two times

231
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,920
a minus b plus minus

232
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,480
b squared minus four ac okay this is

233
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,880
very important to the quadratic equation

234
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,440
right we have to lose what's this

235
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,200
this is the root two roots two roots two

236
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,399
roots

237
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,399
to this equation

238
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,120
yeah quadratic equation a b c are

239
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,519
constant and we want to find the value

240
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,959
of x and this is the formula yeah there

241
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,839
are two roots

242
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,399
okay

243
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,399
make sense

244
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,640
okay so this okay so look we're coming

245
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,560
back to this

246
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,480
so when n is one

247
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,320
n is one so is when n is one is one plus

248
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,240
five right this is golden ratio already

249
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,920
and when n is two

250
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,720
one nine is two two times uh two

251
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,959
fraction two uh two over

252
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,760
two plus equal

253
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,880
e minus 2 square

254
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,640
4 plus 4 a yeah so plus 4.

255
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,079
okay so we can substitute we can do this

256
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,680
a little bit so

257
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,519
2

258
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,880
plus minus

259
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,360
four

260
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,560
two right four times two divided by two

261
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,040
so that's one plus

262
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,720
minus

263
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,600
what's that well if i take these four

264
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,519
outside that would be two right yeah

265
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,839
so i turn to all right cancel all these

266
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,680
two those will be like that okay if then

267
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,800
we keep the positive one because this

268
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,800
one

269
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,519
uh is bigger than one so we keep it

270
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,560
perfect so simulation is this one

271
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,440
one plus two squared

272
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,079
2 squared so squared so what's this

273
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,959
value we don't know yeah yeah what's

274
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,360
one point something one point

275
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,680
do you still remember

276
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,240
so okay first of all how do we how do we

277
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,440
estimate this square root of 2 what's

278
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,959
this value how do we estimate it

279
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,959
remember how do we estimate it

280
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,800
[Music]

281
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,880
how do we estimate it there are a few

282
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,440
ways we can estimate it

283
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,200
so look the integer bar is between 1 to

284
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,320
2 right right

285
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,399
yeah

286
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,519
because 1 squared is 1 2 square is 4

287
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,839
right

288
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,480
all

289
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,680
right so is it um

290
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,680
it's

291
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,639
so this square this square is two right

292
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,800
so it's less than two all right

293
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,399
yeah

294
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,320
do you get it

295
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,399
so look let's assume it's one yeah

296
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,440
because the integer pi is one so one

297
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,959
plus something the fraction number x

298
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,079
square equals

299
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,440
two right

300
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,399
all right

301
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,600
this is at one point x this is square

302
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,839
root of two right if i square it

303
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,639
okay so this becomes two on the right

304
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,639
hand side right

305
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,480
x x is a number x is number between zero

306
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,160
to one right

307
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,160
it's a fraction number

308
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,440
it's like 0.5

309
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,079
0.2 right so look

310
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,480
remember a plus b

311
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,920
square what's this how do i roll this

312
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,639
this is a square plus b square

313
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,639
plus what

314
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,040
this is the number

315
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,880
two times a times b yeah

316
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,519
okay so but look

317
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,000
this this one because x is so small yeah

318
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,399
it's a small number it's a small number

319
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,839
so let's just do this look

320
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:05,360
then this is one square plus s square

321
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,720
plus two times one times x right two x

322
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,160
equals 2. okay look x is a number b

323
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,200
smaller than one

324
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,600
all right

325
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,639
so let's just consider it at the moment

326
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,519
so look at x 1 plus 2 x equals 2 what's

327
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,360
x

328
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,279
1 plus 2 x equals 2 so 2x equals i move

329
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,399
these two

330
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,399
so x equals 1.

331
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,000
okay so now we have a good estimation

332
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,079
0.5 okay so x is 0.5 i think it's

333
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,600
something like zero point

334
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,720
okay okay look look now it is not 1.5

335
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,760
right because look 1.5 squared

336
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,839
square is 2.25 it's not too right so we

337
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,440
can keep doing this look 1.5 plus x

338
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,720
yeah one point thirty three no no one

339
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,959
point five x

340
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,480
let's do it square equals two and then

341
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,320
we can keep doing this

342
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,839
look

343
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,360
2.25 plus

344
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,399
s square plus two times two times a

345
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,240
x that will be 3x equals 2 right

346
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,720
all right so we abandon this for a

347
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,240
moment because it's too small okay so 3

348
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,639
times x equals minus 0.25

349
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,480
so x is what

350
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,399
x equals x is 1

351
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,160
minus

352
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,040
1 over 12 right

353
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,920
this is a quarter divided by 3

354
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
is

355
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,240
12.

356
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,440
okay so look we have this is x basically

357
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,120
x is the

358
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,519
adjustment term

359
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,160
adjustment term okay so we keep keep

360
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,279
amending the result so the previously is

361
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,240
1.5 right and then i can just minus what

362
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,720
1 over 12. so what's this number

363
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,720
1 over 12.

364
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,720
1 over 12

365
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,240
is

366
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:57,650
0.083 okay if we use 1.5 to to subtract

367
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,079
that will be what 1.41

368
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,279
[Music]

369
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,639
seven yeah

370
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,880
all right

371
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,480
so look this number if we square this

372
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,560
number what happened one point

373
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,600
four one seven times one point four one

374
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,880
seven

375
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,600
is two point zero zero seven eight eight

376
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,519
nine you see very close right so we can

377
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,399
keep doing this look we already know

378
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,720
this number and we can plus x and then

379
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,880
square equals 2. and then we can keep

380
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,880
doing it by appending the x squared

381
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,959
because it's so small right and then we

382
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,440
can solve this linear equation and get

383
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,240
the x term next adjustment and put it

384
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,240
back

385
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,600
together this is the way to estimate it

386
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,600
properly

387
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,040
make sense

388
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,320
yeah okay

389
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,480
so uh okay where are we

390
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,800
well we talked about a lot and forgot

391
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,320
the original topic

392
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,959
so

393
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,519
yeah this is the civilization like civil

394
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,720
rights so how is that useful right how

395
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,600
is the user

396
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,920
remember uh so look the first first few

397
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,279
terms the first two term yeah

398
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,320
b a

399
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,320
okay

400
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,360
how about look how about if i say the

401
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,440
next term is what two times a plus b

402
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,959
yeah remember

403
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,720
all right the fibonacci number is what

404
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,600
fibonacci number let's say fibonacci

405
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,880
number we can do this if the first one

406
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,160
zero if n equals zero

407
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,880
is one

408
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,279
if n equals one and then what

409
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:36,480
if n is bigger than two is f i b

410
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,160
n minus one plus f i b

411
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,680
n minus two right

412
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,440
yeah

413
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,759
equation yeah

414
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,440
left how about if i say okay if i times

415
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,440
n here if i times two here

416
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:55,279
so look if i i have a function that f n

417
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:00,800
equals what and then i can say

418
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:04,880
2 times f n minus 1 plus f n minus 2

419
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,760
if n bigger equal than 2. okay

420
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,520
so what's this look all right

421
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,880
if look what what's the difference

422
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,520
between this one and the fibonacci

423
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,120
number look at this

424
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,199
there's only one difference here which

425
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,600
is what

426
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,640
if and

427
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,799
bigger

428
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,720
or you wouldn't so what's the difference

429
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,959
what's it what is how is the difference

430
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,959
between this one and fibonacci number

431
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,120
because because in fibonacci number is

432
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,080
there is no two right i put the two so

433
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,840
okay so let's try this and

434
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,039
so look okay

435
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,679
zero one okay so what's next term

436
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,679
what's my next term

437
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,000
no no not the fibonacci number the one

438
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,559
like times two two times two

439
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,280
two okay what's the next one six

440
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,280
huh two times plus one oh two times

441
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,960
look

442
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,360
f n equals 2 times f n minus 1 plus f n

443
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,120
minus 2 okay

444
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,880
you said this is the difference between

445
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,200
fibonacci numbers with all these two now

446
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,200
i have these two so the next one is two

447
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,400
times f two times y plus two

448
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,799
twelve

449
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,000
two times twelve plus five

450
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,280
is nine

451
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,280
two times this plus this

452
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:50,480
70 70 okay this keep going right yeah

453
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:53,679
you see you'll see 169.

454
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,600
yeah 169. okay and keep going okay

455
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,440
so we call this this

456
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,880
remember this is the name we call it

457
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,039
pair number

458
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,280
pair number

459
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,919
pair numbers okay this is the term for

460
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,760
the 10 numbers so each one is the two

461
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,039
times the previous one plus the one

462
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,000
before

463
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,960
right this is complete numbers

464
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,960
yeah

465
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,640
so we can also use it using uh it's

466
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,400
quite similar to the fibonacci number we

467
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,679
can just do this define

468
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,960
pair

469
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,840
n okay

470
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,039
and if n equal equals zero return

471
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,600
zero

472
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,960
if n equal equal one

473
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,080
return

474
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,880
one

475
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,840
else return one return

476
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,240
two times

477
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,799
air n minus 1

478
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,039
plus pair

479
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,880
minus 2 okay

480
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,880
and what's the one we're missing

481
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,120
cash right because we don't want yeah

482
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000
yeah

483
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,480
yeah

484
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
okay so another iterative method okay

485
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,240
it's a rating number

486
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,240
it's a rating number define

487
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,919
pair

488
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,240
and yeah we can say okay a b equals zero

489
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,960
one and then four

490
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,640
in branch

491
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,840
and i know can say two a and

492
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,480
a b

493
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,559
equals one a will become the new b right

494
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,919
and then b will become

495
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,840
the two times uh

496
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,919
two times b

497
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,720
cosine b plus a right two times the

498
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,039
previous one plus a right

499
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,520
okay let's let's walk b and a okay so

500
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,799
make it better b and a

501
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,720
so b

502
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,880
a

503
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,159
b will become the new a

504
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,240
right and then that would be two times a

505
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,559
plus b

506
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,760
okay and then we can just return return

507
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,760
b okay

508
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,760
whatever this is the paired number

509
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,520
okay so c variation is related to pair

510
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,440
number

511
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,600
and golden ratio is to relate it to

512
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,559
fibonacci number okay just to make it

513
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,440
clear

514
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,360
so

515
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,360
so why is it useful how do we use the

516
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,600
silver ratio

517
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,760
remember that the civil rights is 1 plus

518
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,080
square root of 2 right if we're not sure

519
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,320
what's the value of leave yeah we can

520
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,000
calculate the parallel uh the the one

521
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,440
stupid way would be to calculate this

522
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,080
zero one

523
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,440
x zero one

524
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,039
what

525
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,400
two times this plus two 5

526
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,480
12

527
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,720
24

528
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:41,120
70 116 24

529
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,679
29 yeah 29 and then

530
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,760
70 yeah okay i know this keeps going

531
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,120
wrong right because what because look

532
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,520
this is b this is a this is 2 times a

533
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,840
plus b right so the similar ratio will

534
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,880
be 2 times a plus b

535
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,320
divided by 1 divided by a equals a

536
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,400
divided by b yeah if we if we look

537
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,960
if we said that b equals one

538
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,039
right if b said set it to one and this

539
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,679
is zero ratio and we use this greek

540
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,520
letter which is what data i don't know

541
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,600
how to write the data

542
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,280
data s

543
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:20,159
data s to to represent the zero ratio

544
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,679
okay p equals one then we can say two a

545
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,720
plus one

546
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,600
times one equals a square

547
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,520
a square minus two a minus one equals

548
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,720
zero remember yeah you see

549
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,960
this we

550
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,400
just changing from the golden ratio

551
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,520
where this is one to two

552
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,679
right

553
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,640
so let's solve this equation let's look

554
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,240
at this

555
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,000
so 2a

556
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,280
minus b look it's the same we have the

557
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,320
humanity plus minus square root of a

558
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,679
right

559
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,799
okay so this is 1 plus minus square root

560
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,880
of 2.

561
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,960
okay so the last way we could get this

562
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,840
the silver ratio is

563
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,159
where where the c one is from okay

564
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,159
um

565
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,840
okay look let's write look

566
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,919
look

567
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,480
remember the consumer concentration uh

568
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:23,760
consumed can continue fraction

569
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,440
a plus b divided by a equals a divided

570
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,000
by b right

571
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,120
look at this then we can we can unknow

572
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,480
this look

573
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,840
that will become what

574
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,280
1 plus b divided by a equals a divided

575
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,760
by b

576
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,400
right this is the golden ratio which is

577
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,279
uh five right

578
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
five

579
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,880
yeah

580
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,320
a divided by b equals gold generation

581
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,960
what's the b divided by a

582
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,640
what's b divided by a a

583
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,320
is the golden ratio

584
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,159
one over golden ratio

585
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,320
yeah so we can say one plus one over

586
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,520
golden ratio equals gold generation

587
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,679
right

588
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,840
yeah

589
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,960
all right this is how we can get it from

590
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,520
here

591
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,679
and and the same as look two a plus b

592
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,159
receiver ratio

593
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,600
c one ratio right and that'll be two

594
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,039
times two

595
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,840
plus

596
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:22,720
2 plus 1

597
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,600
2 plus b divided by a equals a divided

598
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,279
by b this is the delta s theta s i don't

599
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,960
know how to write it

600
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,440
delta s

601
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,400
so look this is theta as this is 1 over

602
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,039
delta s so 2 times 2 plus

603
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,400
1 over

604
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,720
delta s

605
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,760
equals delta s

606
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,880
okay so this is a serial ratio

607
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,480
okay

608
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,400
so look let's take this golden ratio for

609
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,400
example right so this one

610
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,200
golden ratio equals this one okay how

611
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:01,039
about if i replace these with the

612
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,000
definition of golden ratio

613
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,679
so you'll be 1 plus 1 over this equal

614
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,320
generation is this every question is

615
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,000
that's only 1 plus 1 over

616
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,720
this right look

617
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,720
what just happened

618
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,880
yeah does it make sense

619
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,919
[Music]

620
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,840
yeah

621
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,600
what did i just do

622
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,080
you just

623
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,320
go the right side okay so i can keep

624
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,200
doing this yeah

625
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,799
so i can keep doing this yeah so one

626
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,679
plus one plus one plus one plus

627
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,080
yeah

628
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,760
this is the continue this is another way

629
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,000
of writing the code generation and

630
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,240
similarly we can do this with the

631
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,400
uh with this watch which is the silver

632
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,000
ratio okay so let's say

633
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,440
2 plus 1 over look this

634
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,880
this is what

635
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,480
this is what 2 plus this 2 plus 1 over 2

636
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,640
plus 1 over 2 plus 1 over two plus

637
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,440
right zero ratio

638
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,000
and as you can imagine if we want to

639
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,159
change this evaluation to bronze

640
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,279
and we just change this number to n to

641
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,799
three yeah

642
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,880
three three zero

643
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,679
and

644
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,600
basic container uh continuation fraction

645
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,240
so if these

646
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,320
uh let's wait to read yeah there's a way

647
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:27,679
to write it look if a 0 plus 1 over a 1

648
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:30,960
plus 1 over a 2 plus 1 over a3 plus

649
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,400
and we can write it as a list so a0

650
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,880
semicolon

651
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,320
a1 a2

652
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,279
a3

653
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,400
okay so for golden ratio the value is

654
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,440
one

655
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,320
one one one

656
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,080
for the silver ratio is two

657
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,840
two two

658
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,159
and for the bronze is three

659
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,840
three okay

660
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,000
makes sense

661
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,720
so

662
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,720
so um

663
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,400
so what's the silver ratio one one plus

664
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,400
square root of two that's equals to two

665
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,919
point four one four right something like

666
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,679
that and how about

667
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:19,039
this if this blue rules will be what

668
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,760
remember that equation two two uh x

669
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,679
square minus n x minus one equals zero

670
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,919
when n is three two

671
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,399
two a

672
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,919
minus three with b three

673
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,679
yeah come on look at me

674
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,240
plus

675
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,600
b squared

676
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,039
nine minus four plus four right so this

677
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,200
is two

678
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,279
this is the bones

679
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,799
okay so this is the value for the bronze

680
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,799
bronze ratio

681
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,559
when n is three okay

682
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,679
when n is three this is the rule

683
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
remember

684
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,760
remember this

685
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,600
yeah i keep i keep talking about this

686
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,159
yeah this is very important equation

687
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,120
okay can you remember this

688
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,039
you can

689
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,200
okay so what what's the

690
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,679
how do we can you write the conjugated

691
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,679
equation

692
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,399
what's quadratic equation

693
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,720
a x squared

694
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,159
plus b x

695
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,880
plus

696
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,880
c

697
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,919
equals zero right

698
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,559
okay so look a b c are known constant

699
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,360
are the values so we can plug in here

700
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,080
right

701
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,559
and this gives the solution

702
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,039
so the x equals this two we have plus

703
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,440
equal so there are two

704
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,640
to this equation so quadratic equation

705
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,880
yeah remember we talked about this

706
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,520
there are two roots

707
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,000
this is one this is one right

708
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,000
max's

709
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,399
f

710
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,480
there are two roots

711
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,159
quadratic equation these are these yeah

712
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,320
it could be something like that when a

713
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,480
is smaller than zero it's pointing down

714
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,600
one a is bigger than zero is turning up

715
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,080
okay

716
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,080
make sense

717
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,640
yeah

718
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,960
okay so to sum up what have we learned

719
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,960
today

720
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,760
silver ratio and then

721
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,080
how can we estimate the civil ratio

722
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,720
how can we estimate the signal ratio

723
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,720
remember the pair number right yes

724
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,919
so look the pair number if is p so limit

725
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,919
when n

726
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,279
approximately to

727
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,880
infinity

728
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,799
look

729
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:36,399
p n plus 1 divided by p n

730
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,559
that would be silver ratio which is

731
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,799
that data how do you write the data i

732
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,799
can

733
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,000
delta s which is

734
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,200
equals one plus square root of two

735
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,279
right

736
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,000
and this is approximately

737
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,399
two point four one four i we spent some

738
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,679
time to estimate this value

739
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,440
okay and then

740
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,679
the fibonacci number let's do generation

741
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,760
similarly limit

742
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,039
and approximately

743
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,039
infinity

744
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:09,600
yeah when n

745
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,399
approximately approach infinity right

746
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,520
f

747
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,960
n plus one divided by f n the ratio

748
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,640
between the

749
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,039
consecutive two terms is equal to

750
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,760
five right

751
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:27,279
and which is equal to what

752
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,279
which is equal to one come on

753
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,799
[Music]

754
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,799
what is equal to

755
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,799
zero one one two three

756
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,000
the next term divided by the previous

757
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,240
time leave as well

758
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,720
[Music]

759
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,640
golden ratio which is

760
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,679
this yeah

761
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,039
1.618 okay

762
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,039
yeah

763
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,880
and how about

764
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,840
limit

765
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,559
when n over approximately

766
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,159
to infinity right and then we want to

767
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,519
calculate this value

768
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,200
1 over n

769
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,159
so what was this

770
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,600
come on

771
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:17,360
think about it just simple example

772
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:21,279
when n goes very large what's 100

773
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,279
what's the value of it one way

774
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,360
[Music]

775
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,039
small and which is what if

776
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,600
really really small small

777
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,159
too close to one

778
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,320
when n goes to infinite infinity 1 over

779
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,000
it you say it's very small i know what's

780
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,799
the value

781
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,399
what's

782
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,039
what's the value

783
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,960
zero yeah yeah you see a median one over

784
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,679
a minute very very small very close to

785
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,200
zero okay so that's what it means when n

786
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,600
goes infinity

787
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,640
this value becomes zero right but in

788
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,799
fact you can't find a value very

789
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,559
there's no such thing as infinity right

790
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,519
so this the

791
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,159
this my next equation name name stands

792
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,159
for limit

793
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,440
okay so let me

794
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,440
think about any other things

795
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,440
so

796
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,399
um we talk about a pair number yeah okay

797
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,240
so let's one last thing okay you can you

798
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,240
don't need to remember okay so look the

799
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,760
pair number the first two items is zero

800
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,799
one right

801
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,960
okay if we can change this to two two

802
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,480
if the first two number is two two is

803
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,159
called pair

804
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,600
pair lucas number okay how long

805
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,399
okay

806
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,600
just

807
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,240
and then

808
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,080
the pair locus number is all uh

809
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,159
except the first two numbers are

810
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,480
different the next term is always two

811
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,399
times the previous term and plus the one

812
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,320
before right it's the same

813
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:59,039
okay so this is another small thing okay

814
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,039
okay so that's it for today good job

815
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,039
bye
