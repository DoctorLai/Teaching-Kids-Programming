upbeat okay so remember we talk about
 

11
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,430
upbeat okay so remember we talk about
we talk about the happy numbers yeah can

12
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
we talk about the happy numbers yeah can
 

13
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,910
we talk about the happy numbers yeah can
you remind me what's happened numbers

14
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
you remind me what's happened numbers
 

15
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,470
you remind me what's happened numbers
uh you just square out the digits and

16
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
uh you just square out the digits and
 

17
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,750
uh you just square out the digits and
then until you get one

18
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
then until you get one
 

19
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,070
then until you get one
i need to go if it's okay one it's a

20
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080
i need to go if it's okay one it's a
 

21
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,189
i need to go if it's okay one it's a
happy number yeah yeah

22
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
happy number yeah yeah
 

23
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,029
happy number yeah yeah
okay so today we're going to talk about

24
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
okay so today we're going to talk about
 

25
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:41,910
okay so today we're going to talk about
another number called ugly number

26
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920

 

27
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,270

if a number has prime factors of two

28
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
if a number has prime factors of two
 

29
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,029
if a number has prime factors of two
three and five only they're actually for

30
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
three and five only they're actually for
 

31
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,950
three and five only they're actually for
example like

32
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
example like
 

33
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,709
example like
two three five four yeah yeah a

34
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
two three five four yeah yeah a
 

35
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,750
two three five four yeah yeah a
sixteen it has only two then it's

36
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
sixteen it has only two then it's
 

37
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,950
sixteen it has only two then it's
ugly 3

38
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
ugly 3
 

39
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,950
ugly 3
9 27 yeah i mean these are ugly

40
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
9 27 yeah i mean these are ugly
 

41
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,230
9 27 yeah i mean these are ugly
oh 5 25 125

42
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
oh 5 25 125
 

43
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,429
oh 5 25 125
but you also 6 is also ugly right

44
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
but you also 6 is also ugly right
 

45
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,630
but you also 6 is also ugly right
because 6

46
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
because 6
 

47
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,670
because 6
equals 2 times 3 and it's ugly

48
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
equals 2 times 3 and it's ugly
 

49
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,070
equals 2 times 3 and it's ugly
yeah only has 2 3 or 5 also so for

50
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
yeah only has 2 3 or 5 also so for
 

51
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,350
yeah only has 2 3 or 5 also so for
example like 30

52
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
example like 30
 

53
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,390
example like 30
30 equals 2 times 3 times 5

54
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:20,400
30 equals 2 times 3 times 5
 

55
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,510
30 equals 2 times 3 times 5
okay ugly yeah but if if

56
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
okay ugly yeah but if if
 

57
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,109
okay ugly yeah but if if
if that is like

58
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
if that is like
 

59
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,230
if that is like
so look if 210 is not big why

60
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
so look if 210 is not big why
 

61
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,429
so look if 210 is not big why
because 2 times 3 times 5 times 7

62
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:33,439
because 2 times 3 times 5 times 7
 

63
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,630
because 2 times 3 times 5 times 7
it has 7 which is

64
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
it has 7 which is
 

65
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,910
it has 7 which is
which is not included in the list right

66
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:39,920
which is not included in the list right
 

67
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,749
which is not included in the list right
so it's not ugly okay

68
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
so it's not ugly okay
 

69
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,870
so it's not ugly okay
so if a number is prime factors

70
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
so if a number is prime factors
 

71
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,990
so if a number is prime factors
it factors if you can express an integer

72
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
it factors if you can express an integer
 

73
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,749
it factors if you can express an integer
as 2 times a times 3 times b

74
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
as 2 times a times 3 times b
 

75
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,870
as 2 times a times 3 times b
times 5 times c yeah

76
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
times 5 times c yeah
 

77
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,950
times 5 times c yeah
if it is in this format it's an ugly

78
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
if it is in this format it's an ugly
 

79
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,630
if it is in this format it's an ugly
number a could be

80
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
number a could be
 

81
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,749
number a could be
bigger or zero equal to zero and b

82
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
bigger or zero equal to zero and b
 

83
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,190
bigger or zero equal to zero and b
also

84
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200

 

85
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,150

yeah for example like um 20 is that the

86
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
yeah for example like um 20 is that the
 

87
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,949
yeah for example like um 20 is that the
other number

88
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959

 

89
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,150

it's 2 to the power of 2 2 times 2

90
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
it's 2 to the power of 2 2 times 2
 

91
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,110
it's 2 to the power of 2 2 times 2
times 5 yes because it only has 2 and 5

92
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
times 5 yes because it only has 2 and 5
 

93
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,070
times 5 yes because it only has 2 and 5
right

94
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
right
 

95
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,750
right
okay let's see 36 is the

96
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
okay let's see 36 is the
 

97
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,910
okay let's see 36 is the
ugly number

98
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920

 

99
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,390

look we can try with the smallest two

100
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
look we can try with the smallest two
 

101
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,190
look we can try with the smallest two
right two

102
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
right two
 

103
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,390
right two
times two times

104
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
times two times
 

105
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,229
times two times
three times three yeah it has only two

106
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
three times three yeah it has only two
 

107
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,190
three times three yeah it has only two
and three right

108
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
and three right
 

109
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,630
and three right
so it's ugly okay let's see another one

110
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
so it's ugly okay let's see another one
 

111
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,030
so it's ugly okay let's see another one
uh 49 uh

112
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
uh 49 uh
 

113
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,150
uh 49 uh
yes no because seven have seven

114
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
yes no because seven have seven
 

115
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,070
yes no because seven have seven
it's not right yeah yes

116
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
it's not right yeah yes
 

117
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,350
it's not right yeah yes
yes you do you have to decide is it just

118
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
yes you do you have to decide is it just
 

119
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,309
yes you do you have to decide is it just
using the same number yeah so if you're

120
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
using the same number yeah so if you're
 

121
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,509
using the same number yeah so if you're
finding the factors

122
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
finding the factors
 

123
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,750
finding the factors
you can actually any num any integer you

124
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
you can actually any num any integer you
 

125
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,750
you can actually any num any integer you
can express as these kind of

126
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
can express as these kind of
 

127
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,550
can express as these kind of
uh expressed as the prime these are

128
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
uh expressed as the prime these are
 

129
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,990
uh expressed as the prime these are
prime numbers yes

130
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
prime numbers yes
 

131
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,630
prime numbers yes
yeah any integer you can express as

132
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
yeah any integer you can express as
 

133
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,309
yeah any integer you can express as
prime numbers

134
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
prime numbers
 

135
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,149
prime numbers
uh you know 7d and the next prime number

136
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
uh you know 7d and the next prime number
 

137
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,190
uh you know 7d and the next prime number
is 11

138
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
is 11
 

139
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,309
is 11
e right yeah so it could be

140
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
e right yeah so it could be
 

141
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,030
e right yeah so it could be
this is multiplier it could be x any

142
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
this is multiplier it could be x any
 

143
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,710
this is multiplier it could be x any
integer could be expressed as

144
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
integer could be expressed as
 

145
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,430
integer could be expressed as
the prime numbers powers comes together

146
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
the prime numbers powers comes together
 

147
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,990
the prime numbers powers comes together
right

148
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
right
 

149
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,070
right
for example given a number like uh

150
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
for example given a number like uh
 

151
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,430
for example given a number like uh
you you say remember

152
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440

 

153
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,630

what any number

154
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
what any number
 

155
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,990
what any number
why just pick a number come on

156
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
why just pick a number come on
 

157
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,550
why just pick a number come on
ryan um

158
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:47,560
ryan um
 

159
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,869
ryan um
109. 109. okay is that prime number

160
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879

 

161
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,509

oh this number is too difficult right

162
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
oh this number is too difficult right
 

163
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,470
oh this number is too difficult right
pick another one

164
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
pick another one
 

165
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,990
pick another one
i don't know if it's a point number if

166
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
i don't know if it's a point number if
 

167
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,470
i don't know if it's a point number if
it's a point number then it's 109

168
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
it's a point number then it's 109
 

169
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,550
it's a point number then it's 109
to the power of one right obviously

170
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
to the power of one right obviously
 

171
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,509
to the power of one right obviously
right yes

172
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
right yes
 

173
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,710
right yes
okay ugly it's not

174
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
okay ugly it's not
 

175
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,910
okay ugly it's not
because because it's it doesn't have

176
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
because because it's it doesn't have
 

177
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,910
because because it's it doesn't have
two three five only if it's two three

178
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
two three five only if it's two three
 

179
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,990
two three five only if it's two three
five then it's an ugly number okay

180
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
five then it's an ugly number okay
 

181
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,270
five then it's an ugly number okay
it has one of those or mixed

182
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
it has one of those or mixed
 

183
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,509
it has one of those or mixed
you know it doesn't have anything else

184
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
you know it doesn't have anything else
 

185
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,710
you know it doesn't have anything else
right

186
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
right
 

187
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,629
right
okay so any number pick a smaller number

188
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
okay so any number pick a smaller number
 

189
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,710
okay so any number pick a smaller number
right

190
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
right
 

191
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,469
right
are you smaller number 25 25

192
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
are you smaller number 25 25
 

193
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,870
are you smaller number 25 25
5 times 5 okay so it's 5 to the power of

194
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
5 times 5 okay so it's 5 to the power of
 

195
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,830
5 times 5 okay so it's 5 to the power of
2 right look

196
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
2 right look
 

197
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,150
2 right look
this is the point number yeah oh any

198
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
this is the point number yeah oh any
 

199
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,150
this is the point number yeah oh any
number again

200
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
number again
 

201
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,430
number again
7 7 is a prime number yeah 7.

202
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
7 7 is a prime number yeah 7.
 

203
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,670
7 7 is a prime number yeah 7.
like another one 28 okay 28

204
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
like another one 28 okay 28
 

205
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,390
like another one 28 okay 28
28 is 2 to the power of 2 yeah this is a

206
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
28 is 2 to the power of 2 yeah this is a
 

207
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,550
28 is 2 to the power of 2 yeah this is a
good example times 7 to the power of 1

208
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
good example times 7 to the power of 1
 

209
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,710
good example times 7 to the power of 1
right this is point number this is my

210
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
right this is point number this is my
 

211
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,629
right this is point number this is my
number you see you can express as the

212
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
number you see you can express as the
 

213
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,990
number you see you can express as the
point numbers to the power terms

214
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
point numbers to the power terms
 

215
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,790
point numbers to the power terms
together

216
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
together
 

217
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,670
together
and this has factored two and seven so

218
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
and this has factored two and seven so
 

219
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,430
and this has factored two and seven so
this is not an argument because it has

220
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
this is not an argument because it has
 

221
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,390
this is not an argument because it has
seven

222
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
seven
 

223
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,550
seven
okay yes got it

224
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
okay yes got it
 

225
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,950
okay yes got it
so how can we check if the number is the

226
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
so how can we check if the number is the
 

227
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,469
so how can we check if the number is the
point number

228
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
point number
 

229
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,749
point number
uh what's the strategy what's the

230
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
uh what's the strategy what's the
 

231
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,710
uh what's the strategy what's the
statute

232
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
statute
 

233
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,629
statute
any strategies how we check if the

234
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
any strategies how we check if the
 

235
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,950
any strategies how we check if the
paranormal is wow

236
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:20,960
paranormal is wow
 

237
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,710
paranormal is wow
it has to be old

238
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
it has to be old
 

239
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,909
it has to be old
it has to be odd or

240
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
it has to be odd or
 

241
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,029
it has to be odd or
finally or the cell phone too

242
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039

 

243
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,150

okay but and then what

244
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
okay but and then what
 

245
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,830
okay but and then what
wait uh no that's anything

246
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
wait uh no that's anything
 

247
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,749
wait uh no that's anything
and i don't know how to explain

248
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
and i don't know how to explain
 

249
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,110
and i don't know how to explain
okay that's fine so how about we we try

250
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
okay that's fine so how about we we try
 

251
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,029
okay that's fine so how about we we try
to divide the two three and five

252
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
to divide the two three and five
 

253
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,550
to divide the two three and five
right yeah as much as we can

254
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
right yeah as much as we can
 

255
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,430
right yeah as much as we can
until we can't and then if the remaining

256
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
until we can't and then if the remaining
 

257
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,950
until we can't and then if the remaining
integer

258
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
integer
 

259
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,230
integer
is one it's a algorithm right

260
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
is one it's a algorithm right
 

261
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,830
is one it's a algorithm right
if it's not one it's not arguable all

262
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840
if it's not one it's not arguable all
 

263
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,950
if it's not one it's not arguable all
right

264
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
right
 

265
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,070
right
yes look for example 28

266
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
yes look for example 28
 

267
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,590
yes look for example 28
we divided by 2 14 divided by 2

268
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
we divided by 2 14 divided by 2
 

269
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,189
we divided by 2 14 divided by 2
7. can we divide by 3 now can we divide

270
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
7. can we divide by 3 now can we divide
 

271
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,469
7. can we divide by 3 now can we divide
by 5 no

272
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
by 5 no
 

273
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,909
by 5 no
and then the remaining is not a one then

274
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
and then the remaining is not a one then
 

275
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,550
and then the remaining is not a one then
it's not our

276
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
it's not our
 

277
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,990
it's not our
number how about 25 divide count divided

278
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
number how about 25 divide count divided
 

279
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,309
number how about 25 divide count divided
by two convergence

280
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
by two convergence
 

281
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,029
by two convergence
can i divide by five yes and connect

282
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
can i divide by five yes and connect
 

283
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,710
can i divide by five yes and connect
again divided by five yeah

284
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
again divided by five yeah
 

285
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,710
again divided by five yeah
and then it's one it's for every number

286
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
and then it's one it's for every number
 

287
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,230
and then it's one it's for every number
yeah

288
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
yeah
 

289
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,150
yeah
yeah you see this one sorry

290
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
yeah you see this one sorry
 

291
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,629
yeah you see this one sorry
so because we are checking if the number

292
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
so because we are checking if the number
 

293
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,590
so because we are checking if the number
has the only

294
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
has the only
 

295
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,510
has the only
two three five these three prime

296
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
two three five these three prime
 

297
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,150
two three five these three prime
factors so we can divide keep dividing

298
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
factors so we can divide keep dividing
 

299
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,710
factors so we can divide keep dividing
it

300
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
it
 

301
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,350
it
right yes because we are looking for

302
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
right yes because we are looking for
 

303
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,749
right yes because we are looking for
this

304
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
this
 

305
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,390
this
2 to the power of a times 3 to the power

306
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
2 to the power of a times 3 to the power
 

307
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,110
2 to the power of a times 3 to the power
of b

308
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
of b
 

309
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,390
of b
times c 5 to the power c yeah if it's a

310
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
times c 5 to the power c yeah if it's a
 

311
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,230
times c 5 to the power c yeah if it's a
point if it's a ugly number

312
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
point if it's a ugly number
 

313
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,350
point if it's a ugly number
it should be least yeah n equals that

314
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
it should be least yeah n equals that
 

315
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,550
it should be least yeah n equals that
so look look

316
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
so look look
 

317
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,550
so look look
and we can times something else

318
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
and we can times something else
 

319
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,830
and we can times something else
something like a

320
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
something like a
 

321
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,950
something like a
big a right so look

322
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
big a right so look
 

323
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,230
big a right so look
look because look if we divide keep

324
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
look because look if we divide keep
 

325
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,430
look because look if we divide keep
dividing by two

326
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
dividing by two
 

327
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,749
dividing by two
by dividing by three by dividing five

328
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
by dividing by three by dividing five
 

329
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,150
by dividing by three by dividing five
and if the remaining is one it's a prime

330
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
and if the remaining is one it's a prime
 

331
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,350
and if the remaining is one it's a prime
it's a ugly number if it's not right if

332
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
it's a ugly number if it's not right if
 

333
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,550
it's a ugly number if it's not right if
this is seven

334
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
this is seven
 

335
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,589
this is seven
or eleven it's not a

336
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
or eleven it's not a
 

337
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,710
or eleven it's not a
argument i'm right do you get it

338
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
argument i'm right do you get it
 

339
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,629
argument i'm right do you get it
oh yeah yeah yeah okay so

340
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
oh yeah yeah yeah okay so
 

341
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,230
oh yeah yeah yeah okay so
you tell me what to do okay if i agree

342
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
you tell me what to do okay if i agree
 

343
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,589
you tell me what to do okay if i agree
i'll go so look if

344
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
i'll go so look if
 

345
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,150
i'll go so look if
n is smaller or equal to zero would

346
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
n is smaller or equal to zero would
 

347
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,790
n is smaller or equal to zero would
return one

348
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
return one
 

349
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,469
return one
return false right because it's not uh

350
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
return false right because it's not uh
 

351
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,110
return false right because it's not uh
number yeah zero is not right my

352
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
number yeah zero is not right my
 

353
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,990
number yeah zero is not right my
negative is not

354
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
negative is not
 

355
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,589
negative is not
okay so look we can do this wire

356
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
okay so look we can do this wire
 

357
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,710
okay so look we can do this wire
n can be divided by 2 yeah 10

358
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
n can be divided by 2 yeah 10
 

359
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,749
n can be divided by 2 yeah 10
divided by 2 this is n can be divided by

360
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
divided by 2 this is n can be divided by
 

361
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,309
divided by 2 this is n can be divided by
2.

362
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
2.
 

363
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,469
2.
then we what do what do we do we keep

364
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
then we what do what do we do we keep
 

365
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,230
then we what do what do we do we keep
dividing by two right yeah

366
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
dividing by two right yeah
 

367
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,589
dividing by two right yeah
so and what are we

368
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
so and what are we
 

369
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,710
so and what are we
and dividing by two

370
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
and dividing by two
 

371
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,270
and dividing by two
equal one two okay and then wire

372
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
equal one two okay and then wire
 

373
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,060
equal one two okay and then wire
and three

374
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,070
and three
 

375
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:36,380
and three

[Music]
is

380
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880

 

381
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,030

we can't divide it then we need to check

382
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
we can't divide it then we need to check
 

383
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,990
we can't divide it then we need to check
if n equals

384
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
if n equals
 

385
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,110
if n equals
to what length is rv number one

386
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
to what length is rv number one
 

387
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,710
to what length is rv number one
yeah return n equal equal one yeah

388
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
yeah return n equal equal one yeah
 

389
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,790
yeah return n equal equal one yeah
yeah so look this is the kind of

390
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
yeah so look this is the kind of
 

391
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,470
yeah so look this is the kind of
duplicate we can do this

392
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
duplicate we can do this
 

393
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,590
duplicate we can do this
in one a much simpler way so

394
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
in one a much simpler way so
 

395
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,710
in one a much simpler way so
four you have to say look looks p

396
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
four you have to say look looks p
 

397
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,389
four you have to say look looks p
in in what in two three five yeah

398
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
in in what in two three five yeah
 

399
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,829
in in what in two three five yeah
this is at least yes yes yes

400
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
this is at least yes yes yes
 

401
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,110
this is at least yes yes yes
yeah where's people

402
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
yeah where's people
 

403
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,070
yeah where's people
p will be two three five so this is the

404
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
p will be two three five so this is the
 

405
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,030
p will be two three five so this is the
iterative yeah

406
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
iterative yeah
 

407
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,829
iterative yeah
because this is a list for p in this

408
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
because this is a list for p in this
 

409
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,790
because this is a list for p in this
this it means the p

410
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
this it means the p
 

411
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,430
this it means the p
will be equal to two to this p will be

412
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
will be equal to two to this p will be
 

413
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,310
will be equal to two to this p will be
equal to three

414
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
equal to three
 

415
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,790
equal to three
do this p will be equal to five to this

416
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
do this p will be equal to five to this
 

417
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,710
do this p will be equal to five to this
yeah this is the loop okay

418
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
yeah this is the loop okay
 

419
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,070
yeah this is the loop okay
yeah n bigger than one

420
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
yeah n bigger than one
 

421
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,509
yeah n bigger than one
and n

422
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
and n
 

423
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,110
and n
can be divided by p yeah and then

424
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
can be divided by p yeah and then
 

425
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,350
can be divided by p yeah and then
can you tell me what should i do here

426
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
can you tell me what should i do here
 

427
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,030
can you tell me what should i do here
and what

428
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
and what
 

429
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,949
and what
if it can be divided by p and what

430
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
if it can be divided by p and what
 

431
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,070
if it can be divided by p and what
should i do

432
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
should i do
 

433
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,389
should i do
i divided by t and divide it equals

434
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
i divided by t and divide it equals
 

435
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,550
i divided by t and divide it equals
p yeah and then that's it and then

436
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
p yeah and then that's it and then
 

437
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,750
p yeah and then that's it and then
return and

438
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
return and
 

439
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,150
return and
equals one yeah got it okay so

440
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
equals one yeah got it okay so
 

441
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,710
equals one yeah got it okay so
that's it today will be just a simple

442
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
that's it today will be just a simple
 

443
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,910
that's it today will be just a simple
mess okay so

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
okay something yeah why or something
 

457
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,430
okay something yeah why or something
here come on

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
probably why yes okay
 

463
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,430
probably why yes okay
why why or what why we need to check if

464
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
why why or what why we need to check if
 

465
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,310
why why or what why we need to check if
why we can divide it by p y p will be

466
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
why we can divide it by p y p will be
 

467
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,630
why we can divide it by p y p will be
two

468
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
two
 

469
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,670
two
three and five p no

470
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
three and five p no
 

471
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,430
three and five p no
no why uh n will be equal to

472
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
no why uh n will be equal to
 

473
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,829
no why uh n will be equal to
bigger than one one bigger than one

474
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
bigger than one one bigger than one
 

475
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,030
bigger than one one bigger than one
because if it's one

476
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
because if it's one
 

477
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,190
because if it's one
if it's less than one we don't need to

478
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
if it's less than one we don't need to
 

479
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,150
if it's less than one we don't need to
continue to check

480
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
continue to check
 

481
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,670
continue to check
right n bigger than one

482
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
right n bigger than one
 

483
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,150
right n bigger than one
and

484
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,160

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,590
[Music]
and what we're checking if this number n

488
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
and what we're checking if this number n
 

489
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,949
and what we're checking if this number n
can be divided by p

490
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
can be divided by p
 

491
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,150
can be divided by p
right so how do we do if

492
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
right so how do we do if
 

493
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,509
right so how do we do if
n can be divided by p if

494
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
n can be divided by p if
 

495
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,630
n can be divided by p if
y no no no no if

496
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
y no no no no if
 

497
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,230
y no no no no if
and why n equals one and one

498
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
and why n equals one and one
 

499
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,550
and why n equals one and one
y n can be divided by p well how do you

500
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
y n can be divided by p well how do you
 

501
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,110
y n can be divided by p well how do you
check if it can be divided by p

502
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
check if it can be divided by p
 

503
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,150
check if it can be divided by p
how do you check the remainders

504
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
how do you check the remainders
 

505
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,150
how do you check the remainders
now this is to divide it but what we

506
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
now this is to divide it but what we
 

507
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,430
now this is to divide it but what we
want to check if we can

508
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
want to check if we can
 

509
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,030
want to check if we can
wonder modulus yes

510
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
wonder modulus yes
 

511
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:54,949
wonder modulus yes
yes we are done

512
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959

 

513
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,430

it that's that's it that's it for today

514
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:57,440
it that's that's it that's it for today
 

515
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,550
it that's that's it that's it for today
so good job today

516
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
so good job today
 

517
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,590
so good job today
can you see say bye to people bye

518
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
can you see say bye to people bye
 

519
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,959
can you see say bye to people bye
