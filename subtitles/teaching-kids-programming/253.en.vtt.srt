00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,390
hello today we'll be talking about three
divisors

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
divisors
 

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,309
divisors
okay three divisors thank you three

6
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
okay three divisors thank you three
 

7
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,589
okay three divisors thank you three
divisors

8
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599

 

9
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,150

okay so number two how many devices one

10
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
okay so number two how many devices one
 

11
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,950
okay so number two how many devices one
and two

12
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
and two
 

13
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,590
and two
one and two so we only have two right

14
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
one and two so we only have two right
 

15
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,230
one and two so we only have two right
there

16
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
there
 

17
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,429
there
four okay four how many devices

18
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:23,439
four okay four how many devices
 

19
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,630
four okay four how many devices
three which are those one

20
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
three which are those one
 

21
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,550
three which are those one
four so

22
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
four so
 

23
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,510
four so
if i give you a number bigger than two

24
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
if i give you a number bigger than two
 

25
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,549
if i give you a number bigger than two
can you tell me

26
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
can you tell me
 

27
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,590
can you tell me
how how many two

28
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
how how many two
 

29
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,510
how how many two
devices you can be sure there

30
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
devices you can be sure there
 

31
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,549
devices you can be sure there
how many so

32
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
how many so
 

33
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,549
how many so
so any number yeah five let's say nine

34
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
so any number yeah five let's say nine
 

35
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,910
so any number yeah five let's say nine
nine how many divided one three nine one

36
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
nine how many divided one three nine one
 

37
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,869
nine how many divided one three nine one
three nine zero it always has one and an

38
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
three nine zero it always has one and an
 

39
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,150
three nine zero it always has one and an
excel yeah

40
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
excel yeah
 

41
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,950
excel yeah
okay so if it's nine you also need to

42
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
okay so if it's nine you also need to
 

43
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,950
okay so if it's nine you also need to
tell me it's

44
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
tell me it's
 

45
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,509
tell me it's
two right right yes i have six

46
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
two right right yes i have six
 

47
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,710
two right right yes i have six
four one two three four

48
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:08,720
four one two three four
 

49
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,630
four one two three four
then one two three six yeah so that's

50
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
then one two three six yeah so that's
 

51
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,990
then one two three six yeah so that's
four divisors so

52
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
four divisors so
 

53
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,590
four divisors so
which is not okay so if it's

54
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
which is not okay so if it's
 

55
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,749
which is not okay so if it's
if the input is four nine you tell me

56
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
if the input is four nine you tell me
 

57
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,270
if the input is four nine you tell me
yes two

58
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
yes two
 

59
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,030
yes two
otherwise it's false easy yeah it's busy

60
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
otherwise it's false easy yeah it's busy
 

61
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,830
otherwise it's false easy yeah it's busy
how can we do it

62
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:25,840

 

63
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:39,190

[Music]

64
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200

 

65
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,190

what do you think i'm gonna check it

66
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
what do you think i'm gonna check it
 

67
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,590
what do you think i'm gonna check it
remember this is kind of

68
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
remember this is kind of
 

69
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,069
remember this is kind of
we talk about how quite the same

70
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
we talk about how quite the same
 

71
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,069
we talk about how quite the same
similar approach when we check about a

72
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
similar approach when we check about a
 

73
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,550
similar approach when we check about a
number if it's a prime number remember

74
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
number if it's a prime number remember
 

75
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,749
number if it's a prime number remember
yeah yeah we always check the do we need

76
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
yeah yeah we always check the do we need
 

77
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,630
yeah yeah we always check the do we need
to check the

78
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
to check the
 

79
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,069
to check the
prime factor the factors up up to

80
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
prime factor the factors up up to
 

81
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,350
prime factor the factors up up to
n do we need to check

82
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
n do we need to check
 

83
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,350
n do we need to check
look if this number is and we need to

84
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
look if this number is and we need to
 

85
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,789
look if this number is and we need to
check the factors

86
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
check the factors
 

87
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,550
check the factors
up to n now the dive axis

88
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
up to n now the dive axis
 

89
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,309
up to n now the dive axis
after n no no why is it yeah

90
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
after n no no why is it yeah
 

91
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,949
after n no no why is it yeah
because because you need to go halfway

92
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
because because you need to go halfway
 

93
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,830
because because you need to go halfway
through

94
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
through
 

95
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,790
through
how only halfway through we can do all

96
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
how only halfway through we can do all
 

97
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,070
how only halfway through we can do all
better than half right

98
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
better than half right
 

99
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,229
better than half right
yeah for example six we don't need to go

100
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
yeah for example six we don't need to go
 

101
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,350
yeah for example six we don't need to go
over

102
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
over
 

103
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,710
over
six yeah yeah but can we do better you

104
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
six yeah yeah but can we do better you
 

105
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,030
six yeah yeah but can we do better you
can

106
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,040
can
 

107
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,229
can
only get up to three we get

108
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
only get up to three we get
 

109
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,710
only get up to three we get
three halfway yeah yeah yeah yeah

110
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
three halfway yeah yeah yeah yeah
 

111
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,150
three halfway yeah yeah yeah yeah
hallway i know i know

112
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
hallway i know i know
 

113
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,670

10 10 20 you see so what what's that

154
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
10 10 20 you see so what what's that
 

155
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,630
10 10 20 you see so what what's that
every time you find the director

156
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
every time you find the director
 

157
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,630
every time you find the director
n divided by the diversity is the

158
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
n divided by the diversity is the
 

159
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,390
n divided by the diversity is the
diversity right

160
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
diversity right
 

161
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,430
diversity right
correct let's say i i already found

162
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
correct let's say i i already found
 

163
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,869
correct let's say i i already found
four what does it mean four is one of

164
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
four what does it mean four is one of
 

165
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,229
four what does it mean four is one of
the

166
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
the
 

167
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,190
the
diverses so what does it mean for a

168
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
diverses so what does it mean for a
 

169
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,309
diverses so what does it mean for a
hundred

170

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,589
hundred
twenty five is also one overtime version

172
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
twenty five is also one overtime version
 

173
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,789
twenty five is also one overtime version
yeah yeah okay so is it half

174
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
yeah yeah okay so is it half
 

175
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,309
yeah yeah okay so is it half
no for this one is what square root

176
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
no for this one is what square root
 

177
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,470
no for this one is what square root
100 yeah got it yeah f ten

178
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
100 yeah got it yeah f ten
 

179
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,949
100 yeah got it yeah f ten
that's already comes from so it's up to

180
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
that's already comes from so it's up to
 

181
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,310
that's already comes from so it's up to
up to

182
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
up to
 

183
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,310
up to
square root yeah for example here as

184
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
square root yeah for example here as
 

185
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,670
square root yeah for example here as
well right

186
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
well right
 

187
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,629
well right
but this one why is this three because

188
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
but this one why is this three because
 

189
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,150
but this one why is this three because
your square root of six

190
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
your square root of six
 

191
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,950
your square root of six
is two point something and it's up to

192
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
is two point something and it's up to
 

193
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,350
is two point something and it's up to
three

194
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
three
 

195
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,310
three
okay so it's all it's close to half

196
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
okay so it's all it's close to half
 

197
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,270
okay so it's all it's close to half
that's what they

198
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
that's what they
 

199
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,150
that's what they
that's a very special case here okay

200
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
that's a very special case here okay
 

201
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,870
that's a very special case here okay
nine

202
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
nine
 

203
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,150
nine
square root of nine is three so we only

204
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
square root of nine is three so we only
 

205
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,749
square root of nine is three so we only
check up to three we don't need to check

206
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
check up to three we don't need to check
 

207
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,950
check up to three we don't need to check
above

208
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
above
 

209
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,950
above
okay because look i have three the other

210
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
okay because look i have three the other
 

211
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,990
okay because look i have three the other
half is one

212
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
half is one
 

213
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,110
half is one
also three okay and this is the special

214
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
also three okay and this is the special
 

215
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,469
also three okay and this is the special
case when

216
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
case when
 

217
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,310
case when
when the number times itself

218
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
when the number times itself
 

219
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,749
when the number times itself
is n these two dimensions collapse they

220
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
is n these two dimensions collapse they
 

221
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,550
is n these two dimensions collapse they
are the same

222
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
are the same
 

223
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,029
are the same
class so we just need to check the

224
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
class so we just need to check the
 

225
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:01,990
class so we just need to check the
diversity

226
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
diversity
 

227
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,830
diversity
and let's say easy-peasy

228
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840

 

229
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,469

defined

230
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479

 

231
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,070

let's say three

232
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080

 

233
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,629

three zeros okay

234
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639

 

235
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,830

and okay let's say if

236
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
and okay let's say if
 

237
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,749
and okay let's say if
and equal equal 1

238
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
and equal equal 1
 

239
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,510
and equal equal 1
even positive if it equals 1 return

240
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520

 

241
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,430

return 4 right yeah

242
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
return 4 right yeah
 

243
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,510
return 4 right yeah
if n equals one or n equals two

244
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
if n equals one or n equals two
 

245
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,350
if n equals one or n equals two
right okay

246
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
right okay
 

247
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,110
right okay
now we have a diver we have counter

248
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
now we have a diver we have counter
 

249
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,550
now we have a diver we have counter
c equals three and we have i

250
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
c equals three and we have i
 

251
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,469
c equals three and we have i
also start from two okay

252
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
also start from two okay
 

253
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,990
also start from two okay
uh c equals two okay because the two c

254
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
uh c equals two okay because the two c
 

255
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,430
uh c equals two okay because the two c
one and excel okay c equals one

256
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
one and excel okay c equals one
 

257
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,390
one and excel okay c equals one
2 because we counted 1 and excel and

258
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
2 because we counted 1 and excel and
 

259
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,469
2 because we counted 1 and excel and
then we start with a 2.

260
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
then we start with a 2.
 

261
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,909
then we start with a 2.
okay then look why

262
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
okay then look why
 

263
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,070
okay then look why
i times i smaller than 1.

264
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
i times i smaller than 1.
 

265
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,390
i times i smaller than 1.
if this this direction we are trying to

266
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
if this this direction we are trying to
 

267
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,189
if this this direction we are trying to
check

268
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
check
 

269
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,110
check
if i times is smaller than one

270
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
if i times is smaller than one
 

271
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,550
if i times is smaller than one
smaller than n

272
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
smaller than n
 

273
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,189
smaller than n
yeah and right and then we have to check

274
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
yeah and right and then we have to check
 

275
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,830
yeah and right and then we have to check
e

276
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:32,840
e
 

277
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,189
e
and can be divided by i

278
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
and can be divided by i
 

279
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,870
and can be divided by i
right if n can be divided by i

280
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
right if n can be divided by i
 

281
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,029
right if n can be divided by i
what does it mean

282
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039

 

283
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,469

if i is one of a divisor right so i have

284
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
if i is one of a divisor right so i have
 

285
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:48,950
if i is one of a divisor right so i have
the c

286
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
the c
 

287
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,150
the c
plus equal one right but

288
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
plus equal one right but
 

289
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,110
plus equal one right but
also here if i times i

290
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
also here if i times i
 

291
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,749
also here if i times i
not equals

292
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759

 

293
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,790

if i times uh if i times i

294
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
if i times uh if i times i
 

295
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,790
if i times uh if i times i
not equals

296
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800

 

297
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,670

i n what does it mean

298
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
i n what does it mean
 

299
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,309
i n what does it mean
if i times i not equals n means that

300
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
if i times i not equals n means that
 

301
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,510
if i times i not equals n means that
because you look

302
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
because you look
 

303
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,550
because you look
look we have n divided by we have

304
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
look we have n divided by we have
 

305
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,589
look we have n divided by we have
i we have i director so the other half

306
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
i we have i director so the other half
 

307
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,710
i we have i director so the other half
is what

308
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
is what
 

309
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,909
is what
n divided by i right

310
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
n divided by i right
 

311
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,950
n divided by i right
yeah and then

312
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
yeah and then
 

313
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,629
yeah and then
i and i when these two are equal

314
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
i and i when these two are equal
 

315
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,749
i and i when these two are equal
when i is equals n divided i

316
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
when i is equals n divided i
 

317
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,950
when i is equals n divided i
like three right look if n equals nine

318
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
like three right look if n equals nine
 

319
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,390
like three right look if n equals nine
when i is three so

320
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
when i is three so
 

321
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,990
when i is three so
we need to add one right but three times

322
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000

 

323
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,270

equals one thing yeah here again c plus

324
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
equals one thing yeah here again c plus
 

325
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:05,589
equals one thing yeah here again c plus
equals one right doesn't make sense

326
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599

 

327
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,150

because look let's take about this 100 f

328
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
because look let's take about this 100 f
 

329
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,110
because look let's take about this 100 f
if we found

330
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
if we found
 

331
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,029
if we found
out 20 if i found out the five

332
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
out 20 if i found out the five
 

333
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,430
out 20 if i found out the five
four the five plus one yeah at least

334
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
four the five plus one yeah at least
 

335
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,670
four the five plus one yeah at least
this is means that i found another one

336
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
this is means that i found another one
 

337
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,070
this is means that i found another one
because i thought every time i found two

338
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
because i thought every time i found two
 

339
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,270
because i thought every time i found two
right except if i found the ten i found

340
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
right except if i found the ten i found
 

341
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,510
right except if i found the ten i found
the other one is ten i only can

342
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
the other one is ten i only can
 

343
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,270
the other one is ten i only can
calculate one because these two are the

344
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
calculate one because these two are the
 

345
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,469
calculate one because these two are the
same right okay

346
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
same right okay
 

347
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,949
same right okay
yeah it makes sense

348
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
yeah it makes sense
 

349
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,230
yeah it makes sense
yeah does it make sense yeah okay

350
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
yeah does it make sense yeah okay
 

351
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,829
yeah does it make sense yeah okay
i'm going to ask you this later okay

352
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
i'm going to ask you this later okay
 

353
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,389
i'm going to ask you this later okay
think about it okay and then now

354
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
think about it okay and then now
 

355
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,430
think about it okay and then now
after this we just need to return

356
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
after this we just need to return
 

357
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,710
after this we just need to return
we can what c

358
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720

 

359
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,389

equals three yeah this is the number of

360
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
equals three yeah this is the number of
 

361
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,630
equals three yeah this is the number of
two what are these two means what was

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,870
what's these two mean why why
is set to two at the beginning it means

370
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
is set to two at the beginning it means
 

371
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,829
is set to two at the beginning it means
generally or because you do the

372
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
generally or because you do the
 

373
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:07,829

376
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
end yeah the beginning end so let's see
 

377
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,990
end yeah the beginning end so let's see
let's one and end okay

378
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
let's one and end okay
 

379
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,750
let's one and end okay
two one and factors

380
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760

 

381
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:31,509

and why here has a plus one here

382
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519

 

383
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,470

like um he found the five and then

384
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
like um he found the five and then
 

385
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,030
like um he found the five and then
and then you yeah because they divided

386
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
and then you yeah because they divided
 

387
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,750
and then you yeah because they divided
it by the

388
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
it by the
 

389
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,750
it by the
end and then and then you find 20

390
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
end and then and then you find 20
 

391
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,550
end and then and then you find 20
is also divided okay and if it's the

392
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
is also divided okay and if it's the
 

393
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,030
is also divided okay and if it's the
same

394
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
same
 

395
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,070
same
if i times i equals n and you know

396
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
if i times i equals n and you know
 

397
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,829
if i times i equals n and you know
don't add it yeah you don't understand

398
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
don't add it yeah you don't understand
 

399
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,269
don't add it yeah you don't understand
number twice right

400
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
number twice right
 

401
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,870
number twice right
some diverse twice yeah for example if n

402
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
some diverse twice yeah for example if n
 

403
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,230
some diverse twice yeah for example if n
if n is 25 n is 25 and an i

404
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
if n is 25 n is 25 and an i
 

405
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,389
if n is 25 n is 25 and an i
is five right you find the five

406
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
is five right you find the five
 

407
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,670
is five right you find the five
five times five h h really

408
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
five times five h h really
 

409
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,710
five times five h h really
yeah so you only add one here right all

410
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
yeah so you only add one here right all
 

411
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,110
yeah so you only add one here right all
right

up to afterwards 10
 

449
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,190
up to afterwards 10
and look this is i times i

450

and look this is i times i
 

451
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,790
and look this is i times i
i so a number squares itself until you

452

00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
here we can put an e here
 

475
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,870
here we can put an e here
if c is already bigger than three

476
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
if c is already bigger than three
 

477
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,150
if c is already bigger than three
is there a way we can just return first

478
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
is there a way we can just return first
 

479
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,430
is there a way we can just return first
immediately right we don't need to

480
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
immediately right we don't need to
 

481
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,710
immediately right we don't need to
continue right

482
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
continue right
 

483
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,750
continue right
even at this point see if we increment

484
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
even at this point see if we increment
 

485
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,030
even at this point see if we increment
c is more than three here all right

486
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
c is more than three here all right
 

487
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,310
c is more than three here all right
so what should we do here c

488
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
so what should we do here c
 

489
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,310
so what should we do here c
bigger than three returns

490
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
bigger than three returns
 

491
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,190
bigger than three returns
we're down let's speed up yeah that's

492
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
we're down let's speed up yeah that's
 

493
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,790
we're down let's speed up yeah that's
the optimization

494
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
the optimization
 

495
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,110
the optimization
yeah okay what's optimization

496
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
yeah okay what's optimization
 

497
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,150
yeah okay what's optimization
to make it better to improve it to make

498
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
to make it better to improve it to make
 

499
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,310

501
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,150

because look if this is going to take a

502
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
because look if this is going to take a
 

503
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,550
because look if this is going to take a
few

504
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
few
 

505
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,790
