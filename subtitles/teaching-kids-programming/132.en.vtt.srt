1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,189

hey today we're outside

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:03,199
hey today we're outside
 

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,070
hey today we're outside
hello mr ryan how are you today good

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,080
hello mr ryan how are you today good
 

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,150
hello mr ryan how are you today good
good okay so come on

6
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
good okay so come on
 

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,549
good okay so come on
come here come here okay so today we

8
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
come here come here okay so today we
 

9
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,350
come here come here okay so today we
talk about

10
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,360
talk about
 

11
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,789
talk about
um consecutive ones in binaries

12
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:14,799
um consecutive ones in binaries
 

13
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,390
um consecutive ones in binaries
so do you still remember what's binary k

14
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
so do you still remember what's binary k
 

15
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,750
so do you still remember what's binary k
two means okay so what's 15 in binary

16
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:21,760
two means okay so what's 15 in binary
 

17
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,349
two means okay so what's 15 in binary
one one one five one one yeah because

18
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:25,359
one one one five one one yeah because
 

19
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,230
one one one five one one yeah because
look

20
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
look
 

21
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,910
look
this is eric come here yeah

22
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:29,920
this is eric come here yeah
 

23
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,750
this is eric come here yeah
this is 2 oh no this is 2 to the power 0

24
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:33,760
this is 2 oh no this is 2 to the power 0
 

25
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,910
this is 2 oh no this is 2 to the power 0
this is 2 to the power 1 this is 2 to

26
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,920
this is 2 to the power 1 this is 2 to
 

27
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,510
this is 2 to the power 1 this is 2 to
the power 2 and this is 1 2

28
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
the power 2 and this is 1 2
 

29
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,549
the power 2 and this is 1 2
4 8. yeah so that's 8 plus 4

30
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
4 8. yeah so that's 8 plus 4
 

31
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,709
4 8. yeah so that's 8 plus 4
plus 2 plus 1 it's 15 yeah

32
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
plus 2 plus 1 it's 15 yeah
 

33
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,310
plus 2 plus 1 it's 15 yeah
okay so given the number our task today

34
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
okay so given the number our task today
 

35
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,630
okay so given the number our task today
is to find the longest consecutive ones

36
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
is to find the longest consecutive ones
 

37
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,510
is to find the longest consecutive ones
in binary so

38
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
in binary so
 

39
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,150
in binary so
how many ones four four okay so how

40
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,160
how many ones four four okay so how
 

41
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,950
how many ones four four okay so how
about a binary like uh

42
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
about a binary like uh
 

43
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,470
about a binary like uh
let's say one one one zero one how many

44
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
let's say one one one zero one how many
 

45
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,750
let's say one one one zero one how many
consecutive ones here

46
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
consecutive ones here
 

47
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,390
consecutive ones here
no consecutive three the longest one is

48
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
no consecutive three the longest one is
 

49
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,510
no consecutive three the longest one is
three yeah

50
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
three yeah
 

51
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,830
three yeah
okay so any idea if given 15 you need to

52
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
okay so any idea if given 15 you need to
 

53
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,870
okay so any idea if given 15 you need to
tell me it's four

54
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
tell me it's four
 

55
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,910
tell me it's four
given this what's what's this number 2

56
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
given this what's what's this number 2
 

57
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,550
given this what's what's this number 2
to the power

58
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
to the power
 

59
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,870
to the power
0 2 to the power 1 2 to the power 2 and

60
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
0 2 to the power 1 2 to the power 2 and
 

61
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,030
0 2 to the power 1 2 to the power 2 and
2 to the power 3 2 to the power 4

62
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
2 to the power 3 2 to the power 4
 

63
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,230
2 to the power 3 2 to the power 4
so 2 to the power 4 is plus 2 to the

64
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
so 2 to the power 4 is plus 2 to the
 

65
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,109
so 2 to the power 4 is plus 2 to the
power 2

66
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,119
power 2
 

67
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,950
power 2
plus 2 to the power 1 plus 2 to the

68
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
plus 2 to the power 1 plus 2 to the
 

69
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,590
plus 2 to the power 1 plus 2 to the
power 0 what's this

70
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
power 0 what's this
 

71
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,190
power 0 what's this
16 plus 4 24 plus

72
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
16 plus 4 24 plus
 

73
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,789
16 plus 4 24 plus
2 2 plus 1 okay so let's try now

74
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
2 2 plus 1 okay so let's try now
 

75
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,950
2 2 plus 1 okay so let's try now
this one yeah yeah 23. okay given 23.

76
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
this one yeah yeah 23. okay given 23.
 

77
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,149
this one yeah yeah 23. okay given 23.
so you know it's list binary and then

78
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
so you know it's list binary and then
 

79
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,789
so you know it's list binary and then
you can you need to give me the thesis

80
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
you can you need to give me the thesis
 

81
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,950
you can you need to give me the thesis
the answer is three because they are

82
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
the answer is three because they are
 

83
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,510
the answer is three because they are
the longest consecutive is one one one

84
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
the longest consecutive is one one one
 

85
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,469
the longest consecutive is one one one
here right

86
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
here right
 

87
00:01:52,479 --> 00:02:05,429
here right
yeah so how can we do this

88
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439

 

89
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,789

we need to be louder because we are

90
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
we need to be louder because we are
 

91
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,190
we need to be louder because we are
outside yeah so

92
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200

 

93
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,190

from the end yeah and then

94
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
from the end yeah and then
 

95
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,390
from the end yeah and then
stuff only and what uh

96
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
stuff only and what uh
 

97
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,550
stuff only and what uh
which side for example like this one

98
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
which side for example like this one
 

99
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,790
which side for example like this one
zero one one one so where

100
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
zero one one one so where
 

101
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,589
zero one one one so where
here yeah and then you go

102
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
here yeah and then you go
 

103
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,030
here yeah and then you go
back and it's still one but when you get

104
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
back and it's still one but when you get
 

105
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,869
back and it's still one but when you get
a zero

106
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
a zero
 

107
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,270
a zero
uh wait wait wait when you move

108
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
uh wait wait wait when you move
 

109
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,949
uh wait wait wait when you move
uh you add one

110
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
uh you add one
 

111
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,150
uh you add one
you wear one to something but

112
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
you wear one to something but
 

113
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,550
you wear one to something but
then the key thing here is that we need

114
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
then the key thing here is that we need
 

115
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,150
then the key thing here is that we need
to remember

116
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
to remember
 

117
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,630
to remember
uh we need to count the consecutive ones

118
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,640
uh we need to count the consecutive ones
 

119
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,509
uh we need to count the consecutive ones
yes

120
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
yes
 

121
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,390
yes
am i right okay so how about we start

122
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
am i right okay so how about we start
 

123
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,910
am i right okay so how about we start
with something very simple

124
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
with something very simple
 

125
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,589
with something very simple
come on hold on no no we're running let

126
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
come on hold on no no we're running let
 

127
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,110
come on hold on no no we're running let
me know i'm not running

128
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
me know i'm not running
 

129
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,509
me know i'm not running
yeah no i'll not doing some things

130
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:05,519
yeah no i'll not doing some things
 

131
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,070
yeah no i'll not doing some things
working outside that's not good

132
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080

 

133
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,110

what okay this is bad

134
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120

 

135
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,229

15 this is the number yeah so in

136
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
15 this is the number yeah so in
 

137
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,270
15 this is the number yeah so in
python we can use this pin function to

138
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
python we can use this pin function to
 

139
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,070
python we can use this pin function to
convert this

140
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
convert this
 

141
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,710
convert this
if i say this it will give me what you

142
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
if i say this it will give me what you
 

143
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,910
if i say this it will give me what you
will give me this

144
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
will give me this
 

145
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,350
will give me this
0p which means finally one one one one

146
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
0p which means finally one one one one
 

147
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,309
0p which means finally one one one one
right

148
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
right
 

149
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,670
right
yes okay after this

150
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
yes okay after this
 

151
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,030
yes okay after this
this is a string now yeah if i i just

152
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
this is a string now yeah if i i just
 

153
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,309
this is a string now yeah if i i just
only speed

154
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
only speed
 

155
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,149
only speed
so what should i do

156
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159

 

157
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,270

so look so this zero p

158
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
so look so this zero p
 

159
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,789
so look so this zero p
one one one one i want to the substring

160
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:48,799
one one one one i want to the substring
 

161
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,869
one one one one i want to the substring
start from the third position right

162
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
start from the third position right
 

163
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,710
start from the third position right
then i can do this two

164
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
then i can do this two
 

165
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,429
then i can do this two
two yeah that's the start

166
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
two yeah that's the start
 

167
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,830
two yeah that's the start
means i won't i don't want these two

168
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
means i won't i don't want these two
 

169
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,550
means i won't i don't want these two
characters

170
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
characters
 

171
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,589
characters
in the front i use the star column

172
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
in the front i use the star column
 

173
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,589
in the front i use the star column
and that means

174
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599

 

175
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,830

no it's just a bracket so you you return

176
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
no it's just a bracket so you you return
 

177
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,030
no it's just a bracket so you you return
this one one

178
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,040
this one one
 

179
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,629
this one one
one right yes and after this

180
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
one right yes and after this
 

181
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,830
one right yes and after this
i i need to split by zero right look if

182
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
i i need to split by zero right look if
 

183
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,710
i i need to split by zero right look if
there's

184
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
there's
 

185
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,629
there's
maybe this is not a good example for

186
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
maybe this is not a good example for
 

187
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,710
maybe this is not a good example for
example this one

188
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
example this one
 

189
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,070
example this one
uh okay let's let's do this what's this

190
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
uh okay let's let's do this what's this
 

191
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,790
uh okay let's let's do this what's this
number in

192
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
number in
 

193
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,629
number in
customers in decimal

194
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
customers in decimal
 

195
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,990
customers in decimal
this is the final what's the least in

196
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
this is the final what's the least in
 

197
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,150
this is the final what's the least in
decimal

198
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160

 

199
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,189

one plus two plus a

200
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
one plus two plus a
 

201
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,310
one plus two plus a
11 11 okay so look if i do this 11 then

202
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
11 11 okay so look if i do this 11 then
 

203
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,749
11 11 okay so look if i do this 11 then
it will become

204
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
it will become
 

205
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,430
it will become
1 0 1 1 yeah

206
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
1 0 1 1 yeah
 

207
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,830
1 0 1 1 yeah
and to this you become 1 0 1 1 yeah

208
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
and to this you become 1 0 1 1 yeah
 

209
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,189
and to this you become 1 0 1 1 yeah
and one zero one one dot split

210
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
and one zero one one dot split
 

211
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,390
and one zero one one dot split
remember a split thing split i split by

212
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
remember a split thing split i split by
 

213
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,590
remember a split thing split i split by
zlo

214
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
zlo
 

215
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,070
zlo
right what what does it give me you'll

216
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
right what what does it give me you'll
 

217
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,510
right what what does it give me you'll
give me

218
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
give me
 

219
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,790
give me
one a list

220
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
one a list
 

221
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,390
one a list
and one one right all right

222
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
and one one right all right
 

223
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,189
and one one right all right
yeah because i split it by zero yeah

224
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
yeah because i split it by zero yeah
 

225
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,670
yeah because i split it by zero yeah
yeah

226
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
yeah
 

227
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,870
yeah
yeah okay so now i can count it yeah i

228
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
yeah okay so now i can count it yeah i
 

229
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,710
yeah okay so now i can count it yeah i
know the county yeah

230
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
know the county yeah
 

231
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,550
know the county yeah
then i can do this max then

232
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
then i can do this max then
 

233
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,230
then i can do this max then
x for x in

234
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
x for x in
 

235
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,749
x for x in
for example if this is a way okay

236
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759

 

237
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,629

that's it that's the answer how's that

238
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
that's it that's the answer how's that
 

239
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,710
that's it that's the answer how's that
does it make sense

240
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
does it make sense
 

241
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,950
does it make sense
okay so how about we we implement this

242
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
okay so how about we we implement this
 

243
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,710
okay so how about we we implement this
and i tell you another

244
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
and i tell you another
 

245
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,749
and i tell you another
method later okay 35

246
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
method later okay 35
 

247
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,790
method later okay 35
once okay

248
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
once okay
 

249
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,790
once okay
s let's uh the input is end

250
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
s let's uh the input is end
 

251
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,909
s let's uh the input is end
right yeah what you doing it's still

252
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
right yeah what you doing it's still
 

253
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,790
right yeah what you doing it's still
good

254
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
good
 

255
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,909
good
yes it is okay

256
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
yes it is okay
 

257
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,909
yes it is okay
look so now look s equals

258
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
look so now look s equals
 

259
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,350
look so now look s equals
what bin bin

260
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
what bin bin
 

261
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,390
what bin bin
and beans for binary and

262
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
and beans for binary and
 

263
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,909
and beans for binary and
bin for beans look

264
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919

 

265
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:33,270

right yeah and

266
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280

 

267
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,870

that's it return return max

268
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
that's it return return max
 

269
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,469
that's it return return max
next lens x

270
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
next lens x
 

271
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,670
next lens x
for x e a r

272

for x e a r
 

273
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,790
for x e a r
r why does it make sense now look

274
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
r why does it make sense now look
 

275
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,150
r why does it make sense now look
what's the term complexity oh n

276
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
what's the term complexity oh n
 

277
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,150
what's the term complexity oh n
finally g o now it's a bit tricky

278
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
finally g o now it's a bit tricky
 

279
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,589
finally g o now it's a bit tricky
this one look at the one

280
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599

 

281
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,510

this one this one

282
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520

 

283
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,950

this is and the splitting function

284
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
this is and the splitting function
 

285
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,150
this is and the splitting function
for spirit function is what

286
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,160

 

287
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,309

because this is not okay and then i need

288
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
because this is not okay and then i need
 

289
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,749
because this is not okay and then i need
to turn scan again right so login

290
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
to turn scan again right so login
 

291
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,070
to turn scan again right so login
and log in this is also log i'll look at

292
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
and log in this is also log i'll look at
 

293
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,029
and log in this is also log i'll look at
this end

294
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
this end
 

295
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,950
this end
actually this is om but this end is

referred to this location
again okay and login and then length

300
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
again okay and login and then length
 

301
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,550
again okay and login and then length
so actually it's locked in oh look at

302
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
so actually it's locked in oh look at
 

303
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,070
so actually it's locked in oh look at
does it make sense yeah doesn't make

304
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,080
does it make sense yeah doesn't make
 

305
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,270
does it make sense yeah doesn't make
sense okay

306
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
sense okay
 

307
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,950
sense okay
and this one we are going through this

308
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
and this one we are going through this
 

309
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,670
and this one we are going through this
array to find out the maximum length

310
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
array to find out the maximum length
 

311
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,029
array to find out the maximum length
okay yeah yeah

312
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
okay yeah yeah
 

313
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,070
okay yeah yeah
all right so look another one

all right so look another one
 

315
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,869
all right so look another one
11. how about look this is this is in

316
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
11. how about look this is this is in
 

317
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,430
11. how about look this is this is in
binary

318
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
binary
 

319
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,390
binary
one or one one yeah all right how about

320
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
one or one one yeah all right how about
 

321
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,790
one or one one yeah all right how about
we

322
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
we
 

323
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,270
we
we go through this from the right to the

324
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
we go through this from the right to the
 

325
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,589
we go through this from the right to the
left so we know the last bit is one

326
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
left so we know the last bit is one
 

327
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,950
left so we know the last bit is one
right right the last bit is one and

328
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
right right the last bit is one and
 

329
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,990
right right the last bit is one and
we change this to 101 right right

330
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
we change this to 101 right right
 

331
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,430
we change this to 101 right right
the last the last bit of 101 is one

332
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
the last the last bit of 101 is one
 

333
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,110
the last the last bit of 101 is one
and then this becomes one row right yes

334
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
and then this becomes one row right yes
 

335
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:15,110
and then this becomes one row right yes
and then the last bit is what

336
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120

 

337
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,070

and then it becomes one right the last

338
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
and then it becomes one right the last
 

339
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,029
and then it becomes one right the last
bit is one

340
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
bit is one
 

341
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,350
bit is one
and then it becomes zero one is not and

342
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
and then it becomes zero one is not and
 

343
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,550
and then it becomes zero one is not and
then look when we do this

344
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
then look when we do this
 

345
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,189
then look when we do this
if it's one we make a counter plus

346
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
if it's one we make a counter plus
 

347
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,230
if it's one we make a counter plus
equals one

348
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
equals one
 

349
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,070
equals one
otherwise we make the counter become

350
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
otherwise we make the counter become
 

351
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,589
otherwise we make the counter become
zero and then we can

352
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
zero and then we can
 

353
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,589
zero and then we can
we can we can have another answer value

354
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
we can we can have another answer value
 

355
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,870
we can we can have another answer value
to remember the maximum right

356
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
to remember the maximum right
 

357
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,750
to remember the maximum right
what's the term complexity look at

358
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
what's the term complexity look at
 

359
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,790
what's the term complexity look at
because every time we are

360
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
because every time we are
 

361
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,509
because every time we are
happening right why is the hovering when

362
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
happening right why is the hovering when
 

363
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,389
happening right why is the hovering when
we moving

364
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
we moving
 

365
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,710
we moving
one bit from the right how do you do if

366
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
one bit from the right how do you do if
 

367
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,829
one bit from the right how do you do if
this is n

368
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
this is n
 

369
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,790
this is n
in integer right 15 how do you make it

370
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
in integer right 15 how do you make it
 

371
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,150
in integer right 15 how do you make it
seven

372
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
seven
 

373
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,230
seven
15 is one one one one how do you make

374
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
15 is one one one one how do you make
 

375
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,870
15 is one one one one how do you make
this one one one

376
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
this one one one
 

377
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,310
this one one one
integer shifting yeah and then how to do

378
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
integer shifting yeah and then how to do
 

379
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,710
integer shifting yeah and then how to do
this

380
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
this
 

381
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,750
this
and

382
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760

 

383
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,110

right right figure figure

384
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
right right figure figure
 

385
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,550
right right figure figure
equals 1 15 wide yeah all right

386
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
equals 1 15 wide yeah all right
 

387
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,269
equals 1 15 wide yeah all right
that means i raise the last digit right

388
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279

 

389
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,310

is it okay yeah so let's

390
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
is it okay yeah so let's
 

391
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,870
is it okay yeah so let's
write this

392
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880

 

393
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,230

define count

394
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
define count
 

395
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,870
define count
one and what's missing

396
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880

 

397
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,230

okay look answer let's begin with

398
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
okay look answer let's begin with
 

399
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,070
okay look answer let's begin with
answer equals what what's the answer

400
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
answer equals what what's the answer
 

401
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,269
answer equals what what's the answer
and then let's say once the ones we have

402
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
and then let's say once the ones we have
 

403
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,470
and then let's say once the ones we have
so far is one

404
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480

 

405
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,190

the ones we have

406
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200

 

407
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,630

y n right

408
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
y n right
 

409
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,110
y n right
all right y n is bigger than zero or y n

410
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
all right y n is bigger than zero or y n
 

411
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,070
all right y n is bigger than zero or y n
right yeah

412
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
right yeah
 

413
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,829
right yeah
it's the same thing i know look look

414
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
it's the same thing i know look look
 

415
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,269
it's the same thing i know look look
how do we check the last bit the

416
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
how do we check the last bit the
 

417
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,870
how do we check the last bit the
rightmost speed

418
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880

 

419
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,069

if n

420
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079

 

421
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,190

n one right yeah

422
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
n one right yeah
 

423
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,990
n one right yeah
it means if any one equals one then what

424
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
it means if any one equals one then what
 

425
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,670
it means if any one equals one then what
we do

426
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
we do
 

427
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,030
we do
one is what one yeah

428
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
one is what one yeah
 

429
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,509
one is what one yeah
if the last bit if the one zero one if

430
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
if the last bit if the one zero one if
 

431
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:36,310
if the last bit if the one zero one if
this bit is one what should we do

432
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320

 

433
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,230

no if the last bit is zero so what you

434
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
no if the last bit is zero so what you
 

435
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,630
no if the last bit is zero so what you
what what happened to this one

436
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640

 

437
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,430

it will become zero because i this one

438
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
it will become zero because i this one
 

439
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,310
it will become zero because i this one
means that

440
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
means that
 

441
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,630
means that
how many ones i have met from the right

442
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
how many ones i have met from the right
 

443
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,750
how many ones i have met from the right
to the left right

444
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
to the left right
 

445
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,910
to the left right
if it's one i end with one but if it's

446
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
if it's one i end with one but if it's
 

447
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,030
if it's one i end with one but if it's
zero here

448
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
zero here
 

449
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,350
zero here
that means that we make it zero yeah

450
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
that means that we make it zero yeah
 

451
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,190
that means that we make it zero yeah
once will become zero so the next time

452
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
once will become zero so the next time
 

453
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,630
once will become zero so the next time
you have a four

454
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
you have a four
 

455
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,550
you have a four
then you start incrementing from one

456
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
then you start incrementing from one
 

457
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,389
then you start incrementing from one
right from zero all right

458
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
right from zero all right
 

459
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,710
right from zero all right
and then what should we do now here

460
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
and then what should we do now here
 

461
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,430
and then what should we do now here

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,990
equals what maximum answer of what
of which value here once

466
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
of which value here once
 

467
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,970
of which value here once
yes i'm going to have an answer

468
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:15,980
yes i'm going to have an answer
 

469
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,389
yes i'm going to have an answer

maximum answer one what does it mean
 

477
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,560
maximum answer one what does it mean
it means that

481
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,670

you keep the maximum value because

482
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
you keep the maximum value because
 

483
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,030
you keep the maximum value because
current answer is yellow and

current answer is yellow and
 

485
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:50,230
current answer is yellow and
now kind of why

487
00:11:50,240 --> 00:12:08,949

what happened to the answer this is

00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959

 

489
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,110

come up or you can say if one is bigger

490
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
come up or you can say if one is bigger
 

491
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,710
come up or you can say if one is bigger
than and if answer

492
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
than and if answer
 

493
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,550
than and if answer
if one is bigger than answer then answer

494
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
if one is bigger than answer then answer
 

495
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,829
if one is bigger than answer then answer
equals one

let's you see writing is much harder
 

509
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,629
let's you see writing is much harder
than

510
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
than
 

511
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,629
than
reading yeah and it takes two variables

512
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
reading yeah and it takes two variables
 

513
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,949
reading yeah and it takes two variables
two parameters you will return the

514
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
two parameters you will return the
 

515
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,710
two parameters you will return the
maximum of the

516
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
maximum of the
 

517
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,550
maximum of the
yeah yeah function and there will be two

518
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
yeah yeah function and there will be two
 

519
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,550
yeah yeah function and there will be two
variables
