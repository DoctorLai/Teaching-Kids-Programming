17
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,750
come on give me answer what's the parent
can you give me an example

18
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
can you give me an example
 

19
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,750
can you give me an example
it will be the same you'll be the same

20
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
it will be the same you'll be the same
 

21
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,230
it will be the same you'll be the same
okay so can you give me an example

22
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
okay so can you give me an example
 

23
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,229
okay so can you give me an example
race car yeah so for example s if it's a

24
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
race car yeah so for example s if it's a
 

25
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,229
race car yeah so for example s if it's a
parent jump like what we can get

26
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
parent jump like what we can get
 

27
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,630
parent jump like what we can get
is it's river is still the same so how

28
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
is it's river is still the same so how
 

29
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,990
is it's river is still the same so how
do we reverse it

30
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,000
do we reverse it
 

31
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,790
do we reverse it
this one this will remember two double

32
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
this one this will remember two double
 

33
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,150
this one this will remember two double
column minus one

34
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
column minus one
 

35
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,709
column minus one
and that will be equal to s well that

36
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
and that will be equal to s well that
 

37
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,470
and that will be equal to s well that
will be returning the truth okay

38
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
will be returning the truth okay
 

39
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,350
will be returning the truth okay
yeah doesn't make sense okay so today

40
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
yeah doesn't make sense okay so today
 

41
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,069
yeah doesn't make sense okay so today
listen carefully okay listen carefully

42
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
listen carefully okay listen carefully
 

43
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,549
listen carefully okay listen carefully
so today we're given a string given the

44
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
so today we're given a string given the
 

45
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,750
so today we're given a string given the
string

46
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
string
 

47
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,810
string
let's say

48
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:58,820

so let's say they have key

52
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
so let's say they have key
 

53
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,749
so let's say they have key
t different unique letters right

54
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
t different unique letters right
 

55
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,710
t different unique letters right
t unique letters remember it's unique

t unique letters remember it's unique
 

57
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,270
t unique letters remember it's unique
okay t

00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
okay t
 

59
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,350
okay t
equals three but length is four because

60
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
equals three but length is four because
 

61
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,109
equals three but length is four because
there are two c but there's three

62
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
there are two c but there's three
 

63
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,230
there are two c but there's three
three unique letters yeah

64
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
three unique letters yeah
 

65
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,069
three unique letters yeah
yeah okay and how about i tell you that

66
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
yeah okay and how about i tell you that
 

67
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,590
yeah okay and how about i tell you that
i want to make a pending drum

68
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
i want to make a pending drum
 

69
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,870
i want to make a pending drum
that is size of 10. size of k

70
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
that is size of 10. size of k
 

71
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,870
that is size of 10. size of k
size of k pain

72
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880

 

73
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,149

but you can use the letters

74
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
but you can use the letters
 

75
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,870
but you can use the letters
the characters in here look look many

76
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:48,880
the characters in here look look many
 

77
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,429
the characters in here look look many
times

78
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
times
 

79
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,749
times
as many times as possible okay so let's

80
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
as many times as possible okay so let's
 

81
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,030
as many times as possible okay so let's
see as

82
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
see as
 

83
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,789
see as
many times as possible for example you

84
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
many times as possible for example you
 

85
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,069
many times as possible for example you
can use a

86
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
can use a
 

87
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,510
can use a
k times it doesn't matter it's a

88
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
k times it doesn't matter it's a
 

89
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,910
k times it doesn't matter it's a
penetration right so for example if k

90
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
penetration right so for example if k
 

91
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,590
penetration right so for example if k
equals 1 so what's the answer

92
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
equals 1 so what's the answer
 

93
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,590
equals 1 so what's the answer
how many how many parent terms of

94
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
how many how many parent terms of
 

95
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,949
how many how many parent terms of
single size why is it three

96
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
single size why is it three
 

97
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,550
single size why is it three
because you can pick three is a good

98
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
because you can pick three is a good
 

99
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,150
because you can pick three is a good
answer yes

100
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
answer yes
 

101
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,030
answer yes
so yeah so what's three there's three

102
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
so yeah so what's three there's three
 

103
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,470
so yeah so what's three there's three
unique numbers

104
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
unique numbers
 

105
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,869
unique numbers
yeah so three okay three so let actually

106
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
yeah so three okay three so let actually
 

107
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,150
yeah so three okay three so let actually
is t okay let's put t

108
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,160
is t okay let's put t
 

109
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,570
is t okay let's put t
right yeah k equals two you got how many

110
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:28,580

no
 

117
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,190
no
no k equals two okay so this is two two

118
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
no k equals two okay so this is two two
 

119
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,869
no k equals two okay so this is two two
parallel okay so how many how many

120
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
parallel okay so how many how many
 

121
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,470
parallel okay so how many how many
possibilities

122
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
possibilities
 

123
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,309
possibilities
whole three how many i can pick for the

124
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:44,319
whole three how many i can pick for the
 

125
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,509
whole three how many i can pick for the
first one

126
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
first one
 

127
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,270
first one
uh three three when i take the three i

128
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
uh three three when i take the three i
 

129
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,990
uh three three when i take the three i
this one is just the middle right yeah

130
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
this one is just the middle right yeah
 

131
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,750
this one is just the middle right yeah
you pick one and you determine this one

132
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
you pick one and you determine this one
 

133
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,270
you pick one and you determine this one
is fixed right because if you

134
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,280
is fixed right because if you
 

135
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,390
is fixed right because if you
pick a this one must be a right so it's

136
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
pick a this one must be a right so it's
 

137
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,630
pick a this one must be a right so it's
t

138
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
t
 

139
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,750
t
this is again t how about k

140
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
this is again t how about k
 

141
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,670
this is again t how about k
equals three

142
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
equals three
 

143
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,309
equals three
maybe nine why is my can tell me

144
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
maybe nine why is my can tell me
 

145
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,830
maybe nine why is my can tell me
i think it's like okay three okay three

146
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
i think it's like okay three okay three
 

147
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,830
i think it's like okay three okay three
inventors

148
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840

 

149
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,190

like many possibilities for the first

150
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
like many possibilities for the first
 

151
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,550
like many possibilities for the first
one

152
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
one
 

153
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,430
one
three t but if this t this has to be the

154
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,440
three t but if this t this has to be the
 

155
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,309
three t but if this t this has to be the
same right yeah

156
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
same right yeah
 

157
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,070
same right yeah
so let's measure one that's an odd

158
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
so let's measure one that's an odd
 

159
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,589
so let's measure one that's an odd
number in a meter

160
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
number in a meter
 

161
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,309
number in a meter
it means i have i can put how many

162
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
it means i have i can put how many
 

163
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,350
it means i have i can put how many
chairs here

164
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
chairs here
 

165
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,670
chairs here
if it's zero three yeah you can pick for

166
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
if it's zero three yeah you can pick for
 

167
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,390
if it's zero three yeah you can pick for
example

168
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
example
 

169
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,710
example
you you a a that's two yeah you can put

170
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
you you a a that's two yeah you can put
 

171
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,869
you you a a that's two yeah you can put
a a b c in the middle right i think it's

172
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
a a b c in the middle right i think it's
 

173
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,110
a a b c in the middle right i think it's
nice

174
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
nice
 

175
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,830
nice
a b c you know it's still apparent right

176
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
a b c you know it's still apparent right
 

177
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,110
a b c you know it's still apparent right
so each one

178
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
so each one
 

179
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,149
so each one
your t t times t right

180
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
your t t times t right
 

181
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,350
your t t times t right
nine okay

182
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360

 

183
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:57,350

how about k equals four

184
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360

 

185
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,110

four can can 40 uh penetrate size

186
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
four can can 40 uh penetrate size
 

187
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,429
four can can 40 uh penetrate size
string of case for k equals four size

188
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
string of case for k equals four size
 

189
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,910
string of case for k equals four size
four how many possibilities

190
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
four how many possibilities
 

191
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,910
four how many possibilities
sixteen sixteen why is this thing can

192
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
sixteen sixteen why is this thing can
 

193
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,270
sixteen sixteen why is this thing can
you give me a number

194
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,280
you give me a number
 

195
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:23,790
you give me a number
um

196
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:23,800

 

197
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,030

[Music]

198
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040

 

199
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,230

the middle two have to be the same

200
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
the middle two have to be the same
 

201
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,749
the middle two have to be the same
so yeah so when you know there are two

202
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
so yeah so when you know there are two
 

203
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,950
so yeah so when you know there are two
options for the first one you also

204
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
options for the first one you also
 

205
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,110
options for the first one you also
the the last last letter is also fixed

206
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
the the last last letter is also fixed
 

207
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,070
the the last last letter is also fixed
there yeah

208
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
there yeah
 

209
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,990
there yeah
and the second one is to the second to

210
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
and the second one is to the second to
 

211
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,909
and the second one is to the second to
the last right so how many possibilities

212
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
the last right so how many possibilities
 

213
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,830
the last right so how many possibilities
here

214
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
here
 

215
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,350
here
uh t so it's t times t

216
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
uh t so it's t times t
 

217
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,150
uh t so it's t times t
okay yeah so that doesn't make sense now

218
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
okay yeah so that doesn't make sense now
 

219
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,110
okay yeah so that doesn't make sense now
so what's

220
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
so what's
 

221
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:04,310
so what's
what's the conclusion okay okay

222
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320

 

223
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,310

and let's give a string and then give a

224
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
and let's give a string and then give a
 

225
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,070
and let's give a string and then give a
k or what's missing

226
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
k or what's missing
 

227
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,469
k or what's missing
okay now what should we do we need to

228
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
okay now what should we do we need to
 

229
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,550
okay now what should we do we need to
count how many

230
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
count how many
 

231
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,270
count how many
how many unique letters in the s right

232
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
how many unique letters in the s right
 

233
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,670
how many unique letters in the s right
yeah

234
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
yeah
 

235
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,110
yeah
how can we do it what are we using

236
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
how can we do it what are we using
 

237
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,469
how can we do it what are we using
no no list s so what

238
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
no no list s so what
 

239
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,670
no no list s so what
if k is one return

240
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
if k is one return
 

241
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,150
if k is one return
yeah you can do this if k equals two if

242
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
yeah you can do this if k equals two if
 

243
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,110
yeah you can do this if k equals two if
k equals three k

244
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
k equals three k
 

245
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,950
k equals three k
can be unlimited are you going to write

246
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
can be unlimited are you going to write
 

247
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,230
can be unlimited are you going to write
a thousand a million times of if

248
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
a thousand a million times of if
 

249
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,749
a thousand a million times of if
yeah we're not going to do that it's not

250
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
yeah we're not going to do that it's not
 

251
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,310
yeah we're not going to do that it's not
possible right

252
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
possible right
 

253
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,270
possible right
so as what kind of data structure are we

254
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
so as what kind of data structure are we
 

255
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,870
so as what kind of data structure are we
using here to

256
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
using here to
 

257
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,870
using here to
to count the unique numbers

258
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
to count the unique numbers
 

259
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,590
to count the unique numbers
in uh remember the one we in python we

260
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
in uh remember the one we in python we
 

261
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,830
in uh remember the one we in python we
start with the stream

262
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
start with the stream
 

263
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:01,189
start with the stream
oh can you can you read it optimism

264
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199

 

265
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:10,469

yes counter so after counter culture

266
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479

 

267
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,950

a notebook with the keys what's the key

268
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
a notebook with the keys what's the key
 

269
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,469
a notebook with the keys what's the key
key is the unique number

270
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
key is the unique number
 

271
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,189
key is the unique number
and then value is the number of times

272
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
and then value is the number of times
 

273
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,150
and then value is the number of times
they appear

274
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
they appear
 

275
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,189
they appear
in a string and right yeah

276
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
in a string and right yeah
 

277
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,590
in a string and right yeah
okay yeah but the number of times we

278
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
okay yeah but the number of times we
 

279
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,270
okay yeah but the number of times we
don't care here we just

280
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
don't care here we just
 

281
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,550
don't care here we just
we just want to know how many

282
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
we just want to know how many
 

283
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,150
we just want to know how many
how many uh how many unique

284
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
how many uh how many unique
 

285
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,390
how many uh how many unique
numbers oh we can use the set alright we

286
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
numbers oh we can use the set alright we
 

287
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,749
numbers oh we can use the set alright we
can use the same look

288
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
can use the same look
 

289
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,110
can use the same look
let's say look already t equals

290
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
let's say look already t equals
 

291
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,670
let's say look already t equals
yeah remember this is the t object

292
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
yeah remember this is the t object
 

293
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,469
yeah remember this is the t object
option

294
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
option
 

295
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,710
option
lens right set we use the set as

296
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
lens right set we use the set as
 

297
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,749
lens right set we use the set as
a does it make sense okay

298
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
a does it make sense okay
 

299
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,710
a does it make sense okay
we're turning this string into s set set

300
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
we're turning this string into s set set
 

301
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,710
we're turning this string into s set set
does not contain

302
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
does not contain
 

303
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,390
does not contain
duplicate elements so you only give me

304
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
duplicate elements so you only give me
 

305
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,550
duplicate elements so you only give me
t that will be unique okay then how do

306
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
t that will be unique okay then how do
 

307
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,270
t that will be unique okay then how do
we do this very

308
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
we do this very
 

309
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,029
we do this very
very then look we need to know if

310
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
very then look we need to know if
 

311
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,990
very then look we need to know if
k and one

312
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000

 

313
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,950

oh let's say k module two modulus two

314
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
oh let's say k module two modulus two
 

315
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,230
oh let's say k module two modulus two
okay it's the same yeah

316
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,240
okay it's the same yeah
 

317
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,830
okay it's the same yeah
equals zero if it's the odd number

318
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
equals zero if it's the odd number
 

319
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,749
equals zero if it's the odd number
all right it's if it's the odd number

320
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
all right it's if it's the odd number
 

321
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,950
all right it's if it's the odd number
what should we return

322
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
what should we return
 

323
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:35,430
what should we return
yes what's your way to ten that's it

324
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,440

 

325
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,150

look this is even number so what what's

326
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
look this is even number so what what's
 

327
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,150
look this is even number so what what's
the answer written what

328
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
the answer written what
 

329
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,770
the answer written what
return what what's the even

330
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:41,780
return what what's the even
 

331
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,510
return what what's the even

333
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,670

t times of k divided by two right

t times of k divided by two right
 

335
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,150
t times of k divided by two right
yeah that's not square right because you

336
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
yeah that's not square right because you
 

337
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,589
yeah that's not square right because you
need to look they are

338
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
need to look they are
 

339
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,990
need to look they are
they are this is even numbers what how

340
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
they are this is even numbers what how
 

341
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,830
they are this is even numbers what how
many is this

342
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
many is this
 

343
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,869
many is this
this is k right and how many is this how

344
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
this is k right and how many is this how
 

345
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,990
this is k right and how many is this how
many

346
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
many
 

347
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,909
many
okay this is k how many is this

348
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
okay this is k how many is this
 

349
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,950
okay this is k how many is this
uh t k divided by two

350
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
uh t k divided by two
 

351
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,950
uh t k divided by two
yeah and each one has two options so

352
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
yeah and each one has two options so
 

353
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,869
yeah and each one has two options so
it's t times t times

354
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
it's t times t times
 

355
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,430
it's t times t times
k divided by two times right all right

356
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
k divided by two times right all right
 

357
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,350
k divided by two times right all right
and how do you calculate this in python

358
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
and how do you calculate this in python
 

359
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,629
and how do you calculate this in python
remember

360
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639

 

361
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,749

t you can use the power function or

362
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
t you can use the power function or
 

363
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,430
t you can use the power function or
drop us double multiply right okay

364
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
drop us double multiply right okay
 

365
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,909
drop us double multiply right okay
yes everybody follow me are you

366
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
yes everybody follow me are you
 

367
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,630
yes everybody follow me are you
following me

368
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
following me
 

369
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,070
following me
yeah okay divided by two

370
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
yeah okay divided by two
 

371
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,149
yeah okay divided by two
okay and how about it's old number so

372
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
okay and how about it's old number so
 

373
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,469
okay and how about it's old number so
what should we do

374
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:40,479
what should we do
 

375
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,949
what should we do
what number

376
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959

 

377
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,190

can you tell me you just square it i

378
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
can you tell me you just square it i
 

379
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,150
can you tell me you just square it i
think

380
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
think
 

381
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,829
think
look if it's another one what should we

382
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:53,839
look if it's another one what should we
 

383
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,590
look if it's another one what should we
oh yes times one more yes

384
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
oh yes times one more yes
 

385
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,790
oh yes times one more yes
so it's return t times

386
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
so it's return t times
 

387
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,590
so it's return t times
one more time k divided by two k divided

388
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
one more time k divided by two k divided
 

389
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,470
one more time k divided by two k divided
by two is still this with this video

390
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
by two is still this with this video
 

391
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,509
by two is still this with this video
and then times t right that's it right

392
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
and then times t right that's it right
 

393
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,630
and then times t right that's it right
yes what's the

394
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
yes what's the
 

395
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,790
yes what's the
term complexity and square

396
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
term complexity and square
 

397
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,470
term complexity and square
n cubic oh n yeah yeah

398
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
n cubic oh n yeah yeah
 

399
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,310
n cubic oh n yeah yeah
wait let's see what's this bit set

400
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
wait let's see what's this bit set
 

401
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,829
wait let's see what's this bit set
count we need to go through these

402
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
count we need to go through these
 

403
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,470
count we need to go through these
num the characters in s so let's let's

404
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
num the characters in s so let's let's
 

405
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,350
num the characters in s so let's let's
say

406
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
say
 

407
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,070
say
look look there if there are n

408
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
look look there if there are n
 

409
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,630
look look there if there are n
characters in the s so this part

410
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
characters in the s so this part
 

411
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,990
characters in the s so this part
this part is okay okay and how about

412
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
this part is okay okay and how about
 

413
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,790
this part is okay okay and how about
this part

414
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
this part
 

415
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,590
this part
we want to calculate the power function

416
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
we want to calculate the power function
 

417
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,230
we want to calculate the power function
remember

418
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
remember
 

419
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,829
remember
what's the what's the complexity of this

420
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
what's the what's the complexity of this
 

421
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,030
what's the what's the complexity of this
remember we how do we calculate 2 to the

422
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
remember we how do we calculate 2 to the
 

423
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,509
remember we how do we calculate 2 to the
power

424
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
power
 

425
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,829
power
let's say how how how do we calculate

426
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
let's say how how how do we calculate
 

427
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:54,949
let's say how how how do we calculate
again

428
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
again
 

429
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,310
again
2 to the power of 10. do you time do you

430
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
2 to the power of 10. do you time do you
 

431
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,509
2 to the power of 10. do you time do you
multiply 2 10 times

432
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
multiply 2 10 times
 

433
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,910
multiply 2 10 times
this is 01 right but you can do it

434
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:03,920
this is 01 right but you can do it
 

435
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,750
this is 01 right but you can do it
better right remember

436
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
better right remember
 

437
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,069
better right remember
how do we do this 2 to the power of 10

438
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
how do we do this 2 to the power of 10
 

439
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,590
how do we do this 2 to the power of 10
equals 2 to the power

440
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
equals 2 to the power
 

441
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,870
equals 2 to the power
of 5 times 2 right

442
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
of 5 times 2 right
 

443
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,310
of 5 times 2 right
yeah does it make sense now

444
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
yeah does it make sense now
 

445
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,750
yeah does it make sense now
so so you can square

446
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
so so you can square
 

447
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,069
so so you can square
or you can you can do this square on the

448
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
or you can you can do this square on the
 

449
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,509
or you can you can do this square on the
base

450
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
base
 

451
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,949
base
yeah does it make sense yeah

452
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
yeah does it make sense yeah
 

453
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,910
yeah does it make sense yeah
maybe this is maybe not obvious maybe

454
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
maybe this is maybe not obvious maybe
 

455
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,389
maybe this is maybe not obvious maybe
look

456
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
look
 

457
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,829
look
two to the 100 128

458
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839

 

459
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,670

the blue 4th way is to times 2 128 times

460
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
the blue 4th way is to times 2 128 times
 

461
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,710
the blue 4th way is to times 2 128 times
right

462
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
right
 

463
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,949
right
below then you can do this 2 to the

464
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
below then you can do this 2 to the
 

465
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,150
below then you can do this 2 to the
power of 2

466
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
power of 2
 

467
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,389
power of 2
square it and that becomes 64 right look

468
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
square it and that becomes 64 right look
 

469
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,949
square it and that becomes 64 right look
i just need to listen space i just need

470
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
i just need to listen space i just need
 

471
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,949
i just need to listen space i just need
to square the base and then i can reduce

472
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
to square the base and then i can reduce
 

473
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,630
to square the base and then i can reduce
the exponential right

474
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
the exponential right
 

475
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,509
the exponential right
half yeah and i can keep doing this

476
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
half yeah and i can keep doing this
 

477
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,310
half yeah and i can keep doing this
right

478
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
right
 

479
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,790
right
and 2 to the power of 2 and to the power

480
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
and 2 to the power of 2 and to the power
 

481
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,069
and 2 to the power of 2 and to the power
2

482
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
2
 

483
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,190
2
32 right yeah look this is

484
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
32 right yeah look this is
 

485
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,269
32 right yeah look this is
again half and right

486
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279

 

487
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,829

so let's log in right in in this case

488
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
so let's log in right in in this case
 

489
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,269
so let's log in right in in this case
rotate right

490
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
rotate right
 

491
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,110
rotate right
all right so oh log k

492
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
all right so oh log k
 

493
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,190
all right so oh log k
oh maybe

494
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200

 

495
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,190

no i'm just saying this is o and this is

496
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
no i'm just saying this is o and this is
 

497
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,550
no i'm just saying this is o and this is
all okay

498
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
all okay
 

499
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,750
all okay
so what's the time complexity

500
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
so what's the time complexity
 

501
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,310
so what's the time complexity
why you multiply it's two different

502
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
why you multiply it's two different
 

503
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,110
why you multiply it's two different
things

504
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
things
 

505
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,389
things
two different events please take this

506
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
two different events please take this
 

507
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,590
two different events please take this
this cost a this cost b how much does it

508
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
this cost a this cost b how much does it
 

509
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,350
this cost a this cost b how much does it
cost

510
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
cost
 

511
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,630
cost
a and first okay yeah look

512
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
a and first okay yeah look
 

513
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,350
a and first okay yeah look
this is costing a this is crossing b you

514
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
this is costing a this is crossing b you
 

515
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,509
this is costing a this is crossing b you
what's the homage together

516
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
what's the homage together
 

517
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,750
what's the homage together
add it together when when do you want to

518
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
add it together when when do you want to
 

519
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,949
add it together when when do you want to
multiply

520
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
multiply
 

521
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,069
multiply
look if if this this thing

522
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
look if if this this thing
 

523
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,910
look if if this this thing
cost 10 times and then for each k

524
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
cost 10 times and then for each k
 

525
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,030
cost 10 times and then for each k
you need to enter m times does it make

526
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
you need to enter m times does it make
 

527
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,790
you need to enter m times does it make
sense

528
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
sense
 

529
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,389
sense
so so how much complexity is this one

530
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:06,399
so so how much complexity is this one
 

531
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,430
so so how much complexity is this one
okay yeah do you understand when to time

532
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
okay yeah do you understand when to time
 

533
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,470
okay yeah do you understand when to time
when to add

534
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
when to add
 

535
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,590
when to add
yeah if it's adding it's separate

536
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
yeah if it's adding it's separate
 

537
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,990
yeah if it's adding it's separate
if it's multiplying what does it mean it

538
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
if it's multiplying what does it mean it
 

539
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,030
if it's multiplying what does it mean it
means that

540
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
means that
 

541
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,470
means that
one is inside another right

542
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
one is inside another right
 

543
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,069
one is inside another right
am right does it make sense yeah okay so

544
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
am right does it make sense yeah okay so
 

545
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:24,629
am right does it make sense yeah okay so
look

546
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
look
 

547
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,269
look
om plus dot k which is bigger i don't

548
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
om plus dot k which is bigger i don't
 

549
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,550
om plus dot k which is bigger i don't
know

550
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
know
 

551
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,509
know
i don't know because k n so it's may it

552
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
i don't know because k n so it's may it
 

553
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,550
i don't know because k n so it's may it
may be better

554
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
may be better
 

555
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,990
may be better
we just do all m class not k

556
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
we just do all m class not k
 

557
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,430
we just do all m class not k
because we're not sure which one is

558
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
because we're not sure which one is
 

559
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,030
because we're not sure which one is
bigger right yeah

560
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,040
bigger right yeah
 

561
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,629
bigger right yeah
or maybe you can do this all max

562
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
or maybe you can do this all max
 

563
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,150
or maybe you can do this all max
and o or locate so you pick the maximum

564
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
and o or locate so you pick the maximum
 

565
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,470
and o or locate so you pick the maximum
one

566
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
one
 

567
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,069
one
okay this is also okay good okay

568
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
okay this is also okay good okay
 

569
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,110
okay this is also okay good okay
does it make sense yeah can we

570
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,120
does it make sense yeah can we
 

571
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,310
does it make sense yeah can we
can we erase this if

572
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
can we erase this if
 

573
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,590
can we erase this if
you raise this if

574
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600

 

575
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,150

maybe because look yes look because this

576
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
maybe because look yes look because this
 

577
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,430
maybe because look yes look because this
is the same yeah

578
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
is the same yeah
 

579
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,350
is the same yeah
the difference is comes one more time

580
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
the difference is comes one more time
 

581
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,710
the difference is comes one more time
right yes

582
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
right yes
 

583
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,470
right yes
yeah yeah a hashtag hashtag that's okay

584
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
yeah yeah a hashtag hashtag that's okay
 

585
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,470
yeah yeah a hashtag hashtag that's okay
hashtag is the comment okay it's that

586
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
hashtag is the comment okay it's that
 

587
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,509
hashtag is the comment okay it's that
for computer

588
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
for computer
 

589
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,750
for computer
for human it's not it won't change

590
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
for human it's not it won't change
 

591
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,629
for human it's not it won't change
anything okay

592
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
anything okay
 

593
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,350
anything okay
you know what's common common yeah in

594
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
you know what's common common yeah in
 

595
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,829
you know what's common common yeah in
common

596
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
common
 

597
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,590
common
it's for for people to agree to

598
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
it's for for people to agree to
 

599
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,190
it's for for people to agree to
understand it doesn't

600
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
understand it doesn't
 

601
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,230
understand it doesn't
have any impact on the logic

602
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
have any impact on the logic
 

603
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,990
have any impact on the logic
right okay so look

604
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
right okay so look
 

605
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,590
right okay so look
so if k is odd number

606
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
so if k is odd number
 

607
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,150
so if k is odd number
so we need to times one more right so if

608
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
so we need to times one more right so if
 

609
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,910
so we need to times one more right so if
k equals three

610
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
k equals three
 

611
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,189
k equals three
k equals three we want to if k equals

612
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
k equals three we want to if k equals
 

613
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,949
k equals three we want to if k equals
three we want to times it

614
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
three we want to times it
 

615
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,990
three we want to times it
k divided by two plus one time if k

616
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
k divided by two plus one time if k
 

617
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,150
k divided by two plus one time if k
equals two or even number we want to do

618
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
equals two or even number we want to do
 

619
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,189
equals two or even number we want to do
this right

620
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:49,199
this right
 

621
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,069
this right
and four we want to do this right and

622
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
and four we want to do this right and
 

623
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,470
and four we want to do this right and
five we wanted to release

624
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
five we wanted to release
 

625
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,230
five we wanted to release
why does it make sense if it's all

626
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
why does it make sense if it's all
 

627
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,829
why does it make sense if it's all
number we want to add one more time

628
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
number we want to add one more time
 

629
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:58,550
number we want to add one more time
right

630
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
right
 

631
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,910
right
yeah so we we can introduce one more

632
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
yeah so we we can introduce one more
 

633
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,230
yeah so we we can introduce one more
function called syria

634
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
function called syria
 

635
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,110
function called syria
you know what's here

636
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120

 

637
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,230

here is shot for ceiling what's ceiling

638
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240

 

639
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,310

yeah exactly let's see and then what's

640
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
yeah exactly let's see and then what's
 

641
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,470
yeah exactly let's see and then what's
the opposite

642
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
the opposite
 

643
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,509
the opposite
floor yeah where that floor for

644
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
floor yeah where that floor for
 

645
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,870
floor yeah where that floor for
but in python look if three

646
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
but in python look if three
 

647
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,269
but in python look if three
do this this is called this is already

648
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
do this this is called this is already
 

649
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,310
do this this is called this is already
flow because it will give you

650
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
flow because it will give you
 

651
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,110
flow because it will give you
one right right so what's three divided

652
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
one right right so what's three divided
 

653
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,310
one right right so what's three divided
by two in mathematics

654
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
by two in mathematics
 

655
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,990
by two in mathematics
if it's singles divide what's the same

656
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
if it's singles divide what's the same
 

657
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,509
if it's singles divide what's the same
divided by two

658
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:37,519
divided by two
 

659
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,670
divided by two
one and a half one and a half we're done

660
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
one and a half one and a half we're done
 

661
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,550
one and a half one and a half we're done
one and a half

662
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
one and a half
 

663
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,269
one and a half
right if you use two two double it gives

664
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
right if you use two two double it gives
 

665
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,590
right if you use two two double it gives
you the flaw which is one right

666
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
you the flaw which is one right
 

667
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,150
you the flaw which is one right
because it's not yet two it just weighs

668
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
because it's not yet two it just weighs
 

669
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,949
because it's not yet two it just weighs
this

670
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
this
 

671
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,150
this
how do you do the top top yes zero so

672
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
how do you do the top top yes zero so
 

673
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,110
how do you do the top top yes zero so
look

674
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
look
 

675
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,990
look
here three divided by two that will give

676
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
here three divided by two that will give
 

677
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,269
here three divided by two that will give
you two

678
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
you two
 

679
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,910
you two
that will give you two okay doesn't make

680
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
that will give you two okay doesn't make
 

681
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,990
that will give you two okay doesn't make
sense

682
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
sense
 

683
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,790
sense
this is kind of original three divided

684
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
this is kind of original three divided
 

685
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,750
this is kind of original three divided
by two is one

686
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
by two is one
 

687
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,949
by two is one
and a half and in person you want to the

688
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
and a half and in person you want to the
 

689
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,829
and a half and in person you want to the
floor

690
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
floor
 

691
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,550
floor
which is i don't want uh i can erase

692
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
which is i don't want uh i can erase
 

693
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,910
which is i don't want uh i can erase
this bit yeah

694
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
this bit yeah
 

695
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,310
this bit yeah
the fraction it's lower half it's like

696
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
the fraction it's lower half it's like
 

697
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,069
the fraction it's lower half it's like
one point half here

698
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
one point half here
 

699
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,550
one point half here
four one zero two doesn't make sense

700
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:22,560
four one zero two doesn't make sense
 

701
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,990
four one zero two doesn't make sense
so look so we can just do this

702
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
so look so we can just do this
 

703
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,150
so look so we can just do this
oh yeah t yeah how many times of t

704
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
oh yeah t yeah how many times of t
 

705
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,590
oh yeah t yeah how many times of t
sia k

706
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
sia k
 

707
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,629
sia k
divided by two single k right that's it

708
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
divided by two single k right that's it
 

709
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,230
divided by two single k right that's it
yeah all right look does it make sense

710
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
yeah all right look does it make sense
 

711
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,470
yeah all right look does it make sense
if k equals 3 3 divided by 2 1.5

712
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,480
if k equals 3 3 divided by 2 1.5
 

713
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,509
if k equals 3 3 divided by 2 1.5
0 will be 2. right yeah

714
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
0 will be 2. right yeah
 

715
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,870
0 will be 2. right yeah
if k equals 4 4 divided by 2 is 2

716
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
if k equals 4 4 divided by 2 is 2
 

717
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,310
if k equals 4 4 divided by 2 is 2
co2 is two right yeah here any integer

718
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
co2 is two right yeah here any integer
 

719
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,870
co2 is two right yeah here any integer
of half

you remember f complexity o n
 

765
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,470
you remember f complexity o n
plus log k right why is it okay because

766
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
plus log k right why is it okay because
 

767
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,150
plus log k right why is it okay because
we want to calculate this

768
