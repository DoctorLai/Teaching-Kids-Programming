1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,640
okay so yesterday we talked about this

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,120
problem yeah we're given this an array

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,679
of numbers and uh we want to pick k

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,280
numbers and for each number we can pick

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,120
from the beginning of all in the end

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,359
right and we want to maximize the

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,720
numbers we picked each time you pick a

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,720
number you can pick from the beginning

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,119
or the end there are two choices so

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,519
there are k numbers to pick so that's 2

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,359
to the power of k right that's too slow

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,400
and we also talked about the sliding

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,960
window right if we there are n numbers

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,160
and we want to pick k numbers right so

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,280
the remaining will be n minus k numbers

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,600
so if that sum of everything or every

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,399
number is s and if the sum of the

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,079
remaining is a so we want to maximize

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,440
this right this is the sum of the

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,520
numbers p we want to maximize this

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,440
we want to minimize this a all right

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,600
yeah yeah

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,559
for example this one if the window size

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,640
is 4 and we move one position to the

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,320
right so what happened to the sum

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,400
minus a plus e yeah minus a plus a so we

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,600
keep updating the windows right the sum

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,840
of the windows

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,360
instead of

30
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,960
recalculating the sum if we calculate

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,560
the sum that's going to take longer

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,960
right we want to talk about another

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,240
approach today it's quite similar so

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,040
look with one two three four five six

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,880
one right we want to pick three numbers

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,640
k is equal to three

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,200
we want to pick three numbers

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,840
so if we pick zero numbers at the

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,200
beginning if we pick one numbers from

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,960
the beginning

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,640
if we pick two numbers from the

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,040
beginning if we pick three numbers

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,439
beginning look if we pick zero numbers

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,200
beginning so what else do i pick

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,799
how many numbers i should pick from the

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,720
right

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,159
so k equals three so it means that i

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,240
want to put zero numbers from the

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,920
beginning three numbers at the end

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,079
pick one numbers from the beginning two

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,840
numbers at the end right two numbers

52
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,680
from the beginning one numbers at the

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
end three numbers from the beginning

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,880
zero from the end right so if they are k

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,119
numbers they are k plus one choice

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,560
all right

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,000
so we can do this we can brief of this k

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,040
cll number from the beginning three

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,560
numbers from the end so what's the sum

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,400
12

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,160
one number from the beginning two

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
numbers on the end what's the sum one

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,040
plus six plus one

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,879
eight

65
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,200
two numbers from the beginning one

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,280
number from the end one plus two plus

67
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,360
one four three numbers from the

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,319
beginning zero number from the end

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,200
one plus two plus three

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,519
so we just pick the maximum which is 12.

71
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,920
okay this is more straightforward am i

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,840
right yesterday we are minimizing the

73
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,319
sum of the sub array

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,200
but this subway is the remaining so we

75
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,840
need to minimize it and we use the

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,200
s minus the

77
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,920
minimizing the sum then that would be

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,080
the sum of the numbers we picked

79
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,720
yeah s minus a we want to minimize this

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,200
bit but now we are directly calculating

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,400
the sum so we are maximizing this

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,519
i want to calculate some of these

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,720
these

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,560
these

85
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,440
this array is not changing right we want

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,519
to be able to calculate the sum of uh

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,680
first one number first two numbers first

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,080
three numbers and we want to be able to

89
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,720
calculate the sum of last number last

90
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,200
two numbers last three numbers

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,040
so what comes into mind

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,680
can we calculate this

93
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,519
so we we use the accumulator remember we

94
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,599
use the prefix sum the sum of the first

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,920
element is one the sum of the first two

96
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,040
elements is one plus two

97
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,319
one plus two plus three we are

98
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,840
pre-calculating the sum

99
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,760
all right and then we talk about this

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,640
accumulate function remember

101
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,200
accumulate accumulate

102
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,879
so when we accumulate look this is array

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,239
when we perform this accumulator what

104
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,879
does it become

105
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,599
this is array right a equals this

106
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,519
if we perform the accumulate

107
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,040
so you become 1

108
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,959
1 plus 2

109
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,760
1 plus 2 plus 3

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,680
1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4. so that's what

111
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,760
it accumulates

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,599
so why this is useful so we can just

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,239
look it up right what's the sum of the

114
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,080
first four numbers we just look it up

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,760
this value we don't need to calculate

116
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
when we need it one plus two plus three

117
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,320
plus four because that's going to take

118
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,560
longer

119
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,600
we look it up yeah because we know

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,600
already

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,440
when we calculate the prefix sum from

122
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
the left to the right we know the number

123
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,600
yeah we know the sum we can have this

124
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,479
running sum right now current sum is

125
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,560
zero the current sum plus one is one

126
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,400
current sum plus two plus three plus

127
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,639
four plus five

128
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,560
okay so the other problem is we know how

129
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,160
to calculate the sum of first few

130
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,790
numbers how about the sum of the last

131
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,040
few numbers

132
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,720
[Music]

133
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,280
think about it okay we know okay sorry 3

134
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,280
minus exactly yeah we know all of it and

135
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,120
then we know the first few numbers the

136
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,000
sum minus the few numbers is the

137
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,680
remaining define max

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,720
point

139
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
array

140
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,400
a

141
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
and we want to pick k numbers first of

142
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
all let's get the numbers how many

143
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,240
numbers

144
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,280
and accumulate we want to have this

145
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,280
prefix sum of keywords yes so prefix um

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,919
he was accumulate

147
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,400
hey

148
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,639
we want to convert it to a list

149
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,080
because accumulator returns an iterator

150
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,400
iterator

151
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,919
iterator is not at least is like

152
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,720
what's iterator

153
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,639
in the year thing so you i promise you

154
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,160
to give you at least a few numbers so

155
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,479
i'm not giving you

156
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,160
all at once when you ask for it i'll

157
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,240
give you one when you ask me for the

158
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,080
keyword when we put this list we can

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,199
write it on the list by the beginning

160
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,240
i'm going to put a 0 at the beginning

161
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,960
okay so look one two three four right so

162
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,919
when we do this accumulate you become

163
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,240
become what can you tell me one

164
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,240
three

165
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,840
what what come on

166
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,280
fill the banks six ten six ten okay

167
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,680
weather

168
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,479
i want to put a zero in the beginning

169
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,800
because look because we only pick k

170
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,680
numbers as i said they are k plus one

171
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,840
choice

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,440
so how many choices is this

173
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,600
four okay

174
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,360
so that k plus one right so i put a zero

175
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,759
means that if i pick nothing from the

176
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,759
beginning

177
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,319
we need to brief us all these k plus one

178
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,759
choice for

179
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,479
i in range

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,319
k plus one right we need to do this sum

181
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,720
as well sum will be everything and sum

182
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,199
of uh everything some a

183
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,080
that's going to take over time

184
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,160
look what we we iterate k times here but

185
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,840
let's going to take o in time so what's

186
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,680
the time convexity

187
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,960
look there are n times here there are k

188
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,520
times here so the time convex is our n

189
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,599
k is smaller than n so

190
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,599
o n okay

191
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,680
the sum the current sum

192
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,360
the current sound let's see okay c

193
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:15,199
equals prefix i

194
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,720
plus plus the overall we pick

195
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,759
here

196
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,639
so if we are at it fetching the value

197
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,919
here

198
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,199
if this k equals 3 we pick nothing from

199
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,199
the beginning

200
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,319
so we need to pick

201
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,199
three numbers from the end right so how

202
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,000
many numbers and numbers

203
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,800
right

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,560
so now we pick we need to pick k numbers

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,960
and then we pick nothing at the

206
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,199
beginning so how many numbers left k

207
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,199
minus i right

208
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,199
and then from the n from the end because

209
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
we are adding a yellow

210
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,919
so the last value will be

211
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,400
n the index here will be n

212
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:58,720
so it's n minus x right so is

213
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,440
n is p

214
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,319
n minus k minus i

215
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,199
right

216
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,960
so

217
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,440
but we need to

218
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,360
subtract these from s right

219
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,720
this is total sum

220
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,360
right

221
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,919
this is the prefix sum

222
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,919
so we do this as subtraction that would

223
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,879
be the last the sum of the last few

224
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,680
numbers right and then we just have to

225
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,960
get the maximum answer equals maximum

226
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,520
of answer

227
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,720
c return

228
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,479
answer

229
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,479
answer the beginning is zero okay

230
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
some people might be able to write this

231
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,680
using this one language this is not a

232
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,240
mandatory i actually prefer writing it

233
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,800
in a very clear way so okay what's new

234
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,080
today what have you learned

235
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,120
learned about

236
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,959
so many

237
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,360
points

238
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,880
what's the problem and what do we talk

239
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,839
how many approaches have we learned

240
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,839
today

241
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,720
that one has accumulate okay now what's

242
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,519
our q a accumulate is basically

243
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,440
like zero one three six ten what is

244
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,200
what's the meaning of the accumulation

245
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,720
what it means

246
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,240
in english i don't know

247
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,880
accumulate

248
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,360
accumulate put it all together

249
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,320
little by little

250
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,920
yeah

251
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,279
accumulate you can

252
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,680
impress and

253
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,000
basically like prefix

254
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,160
do you still remember why we need to do

255
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
this accumulate look okay what's the sum

256
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,320
of uh

257
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,320
two part three plus four

258
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,640
nine

259
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,080
okay

260
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,080
we are given this array all right we

261
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
want to calculate the sum of any

262
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,279
intervals

263
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,279
all right how how would you do it the

264
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,600
normal way would be

265
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,880
you just calculate two plus three plus

266
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,760
one right

267
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,760
okay so look if consider look

268
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,000
listen can see that this is a very big

269
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,440
number one to a minion

270
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,320
okay

271
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,079
one two three four

272
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,079
a minion i don't know okay

273
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,680
i know it could be many let's say i want

274
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,360
to calculate a interval somewhere

275
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,839
for example i want to keep cancer from

276
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,120
two to a minute minus one how would you

277
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,279
do it

278
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,640
the stupid way would be just two plus

279
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,560
three plus one right you're going to

280
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,640
take forever right

281
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,360
but how would you do it if i'm saying

282
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,160
this array is not changing

283
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,320
but how about accumulate prefix sum

284
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,720
so look i calculate one

285
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,600
one plus two three one plus two plus

286
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,399
three

287
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,760
6

288
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,839
10 et cetera okay so taking this example

289
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,680
so this number will be

290
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,800
prefix sum will be 1 3 6 10 15

291
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,560
21 okay and what's the sum of of 2 plus

292
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,360
3 plus four

293
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,680
is it equals to one plus two plus three

294
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,720
plus four minus one

295
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,200
yeah

296
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,399
okay so one plus two plus three power is

297
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,600
ten

298
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,920
okay what's the sum of up to one and one

299
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,399
so what's the sum

300
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,440
ten minus one for this array i calculate

301
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,279
once

302
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,120
so i can just look it up look it up two

303
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,040
values look at the two values and do

304
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,920
this subtraction

305
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,519
right

306
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
is it quicker

307
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,720
looking up is it quicker yeah

308
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,200
okay

309
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,040
okay so okay let me repeat

310
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,200
yesterday we talked about

311
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,200
these using the two-pointer sliding

312
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,959
window thing because they we want to

313
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
maximize

314
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,519
s minus a

315
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,040
a

316
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,839
is the sum of the remaining numbers

317
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,320
right

318
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,079
we want to maximize this so

319
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,320
it means that we need to minimize the

320
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,320
remaining numbers right

321
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,519
for the remaining numbers we use the

322
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,079
sliding window to keep updating

323
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,360
updating the sum of the windows size and

324
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,040
minus k

325
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,839
right that will work

326
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,160
today we are talking about a different

327
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,320
approach to pick k numbers we have k

328
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,240
plus one choice

329
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,760
picking zero numbers from the beginning

330
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,200
picking one numbers from beginner

331
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,519
picking two numbers from beginning

332
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,399
picking k numbers from beginning zero to

333
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,959
k layer k plus one possibilities

334
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,240
for each possibility we can use the

335
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,880
accumulated prefix sum to get the sum of

336
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,279
the first few numbers right that's easy

337
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,320
we're doing this lookup

338
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,720
but

339
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,200
we also need the sum of the last few

340
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,480
numbers in order to do that we use the

341
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,880
subtraction right we know the sum of all

342
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,120
the numbers we just need to minus a few

343
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,279
numbers then that'll be the sum of the

344
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,160
last few numbers am right

345
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,880
okay

346
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,480
okay and then the time complexity look

347
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,040
accumulate

348
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,160
a one time space over in space

349
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,000
sum or when time so it's o m plus o n

350
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,639
plus okay

351
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,079
okay so let's open time space complexity

352
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,399
we're using the accumulate prefix array

353
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,720
so that's all going to take oven

354
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,160
space okay that's it for today bye bye

355
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,160
bye

356
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,160
bye
