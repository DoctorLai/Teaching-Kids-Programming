1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,150

go hello hello mr area all right

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,160
go hello hello mr area all right
 

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,190
go hello hello mr area all right
uh so today we talk about these three

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:07,200
uh so today we talk about these three
 

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,430
uh so today we talk about these three
numbers the direction change okay so

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
numbers the direction change okay so
 

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,549
numbers the direction change okay so
given these numbers

8
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
given these numbers
 

9
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,749
given these numbers
there's a few numbers one three five

10
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:13,759
there's a few numbers one three five
 

11
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,790
there's a few numbers one three five
four three okay let's see

12
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
four three okay let's see
 

13
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,470
four three okay let's see
if we plot these numbers along this x

14
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
if we plot these numbers along this x
 

15
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,269
if we plot these numbers along this x
axis okay let's say that this is xx this

16
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
axis okay let's say that this is xx this
 

17
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,550
axis okay let's say that this is xx this
is y

18
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
is y
 

19
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,990
is y
okay so one is here

20
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000

 

21
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,669

three five four

22
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
three five four
 

23
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,630
three five four
three okay if you throw these lines so

24
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
three okay if you throw these lines so
 

25
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,389
three okay if you throw these lines so
can you tell me how many

26
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
can you tell me how many
 

27
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,709
can you tell me how many
times that the direction is checked what

28
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
times that the direction is checked what
 

29
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,229
times that the direction is checked what
i mean direction changes

30
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:40,239
i mean direction changes
 

31
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,910
i mean direction changes
if you're going up and then you go down

32
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920
if you're going up and then you go down
 

33
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,590
if you're going up and then you go down
that's the direction change or if you're

34
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
that's the direction change or if you're
 

35
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,110
that's the direction change or if you're
going down and then

36
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,120
going down and then
 

37
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,310
going down and then
suddenly you're going up let's say

38
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
suddenly you're going up let's say
 

39
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,389
suddenly you're going up let's say
there's some change so it's like a peak

40
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
there's some change so it's like a peak
 

41
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,510
there's some change so it's like a peak
click here how about if it's

42
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
click here how about if it's
 

43
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,670
click here how about if it's
a horizontal no that's not direction

44
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
a horizontal no that's not direction
 

45
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,830
a horizontal no that's not direction
change or if it's here this way it's not

46
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
change or if it's here this way it's not
 

47
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,910
change or if it's here this way it's not
a return change right because it's keep

48
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
a return change right because it's keep
 

49
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,029
a return change right because it's keep
keep the trending

50
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
keep the trending
 

51
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,430
keep the trending
but here is the change in the direction

52
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
but here is the change in the direction
 

53
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,029
but here is the change in the direction
if we go up and then we're going down oh

54
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
if we go up and then we're going down oh
 

55
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,310
if we go up and then we're going down oh
if we're already not going down and

56
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
if we're already not going down and
 

57
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,030
if we're already not going down and
we're going up

58
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
we're going up
 

59
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,469
we're going up
let's say the return change how many

60
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
let's say the return change how many
 

61
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,710
let's say the return change how many
directions here

62
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720

 

63
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,550

how many directions come on you can see

64
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
how many directions come on you can see
 

65
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,070
how many directions come on you can see
it why two

66
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
it why two
 

67
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,870

if we're given these
 

79
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,550
if we're given these
n numbers then we want to count how many

80
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
n numbers then we want to count how many
 

81

99
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,190

[Music]

100
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
[Music]
 

101
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,790
[Music]
around it and we want to have a

102
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
around it and we want to have a
 

103
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,309
around it and we want to have a
like a thingy like that ah

104
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
like a thingy like that ah
 

105
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,670
like a thingy like that ah
other changes okay

106
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
other changes okay
 

107
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,869
other changes okay
okay that's very creative okay so how

108
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
okay that's very creative okay so how
 

109
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,030
okay that's very creative okay so how
can you tell if it's a changes

110
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
can you tell if it's a changes
 

111
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,470
can you tell if it's a changes
let's speak let's cause it's like yeah

112
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
let's speak let's cause it's like yeah
 

113
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,470
let's speak let's cause it's like yeah
okay so how can we change uh how can we

114
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
okay so how can we change uh how can we
 

115
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,750
okay so how can we change uh how can we
detect these

116
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
detect these
 

117
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,470
detect these
the patterns okay so the pattern we are

118
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
the patterns okay so the pattern we are
 

119
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,030
the patterns okay so the pattern we are
looking for

120
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
looking for
 

121
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,710
looking for
is what is something like that or that

122
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
is what is something like that or that
 

123
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,550
is what is something like that or that
yeah something like that or not yeah

124
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
yeah something like that or not yeah
 

125
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,150
yeah something like that or not yeah
yeah okay so the trending the trending

126
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
yeah okay so the trending the trending
 

127
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,869
yeah okay so the trending the trending
must change right the training

128
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
must change right the training
 

129
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,509
must change right the training
so if i tell you look one three if i use

130
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
so if i tell you look one three if i use
 

131
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,990
so if i tell you look one three if i use
this number minus this that will be two

132
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
this number minus this that will be two
 

133
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,390
this number minus this that will be two
yeah this number minus this will be two

134
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
yeah this number minus this will be two
 

135
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,630
yeah this number minus this will be two
this number minus this will be minus one

136
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
this number minus this will be minus one
 

137
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,509
this number minus this will be minus one
this minus

138
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
this minus
 

139
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,110
this minus
this one will be minus sign so can you

140
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
this one will be minus sign so can you
 

141
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,630
this one will be minus sign so can you
see the two

142
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
see the two
 

143
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,750
see the two
t minus one minus okay so can you see

144
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
t minus one minus okay so can you see
 

145
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,750
t minus one minus okay so can you see
how we can make use of the difference

146
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
how we can make use of the difference
 

147
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,509
how we can make use of the difference
between the next number and the current

148
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
between the next number and the current
 

149
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,149
between the next number and the current
number

150
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
number
 

151
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,229
number
as the trend the next number and the

152
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
as the trend the next number and the
 

153
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,430
as the trend the next number and the
current number

154
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
current number
 

155
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,710
current number
so can you notice the difference 2

156
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
so can you notice the difference 2
 

157
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,830
so can you notice the difference 2
2 minus 1 minus 1 what does it mean if

158
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
2 minus 1 minus 1 what does it mean if
 

159
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,710
2 minus 1 minus 1 what does it mean if
we

160
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
we
 

161
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,830
we
look if the if

162
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
look if the if
 

163
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,270
look if the if
they are all positive

164
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280

 

165
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,630

actually no what is it i actually don't

166
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
actually no what is it i actually don't
 

167
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,430
actually no what is it i actually don't
know

168
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
know
 

169
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,910
know
so look if it's positive if it's stay

170
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
so look if it's positive if it's stay
 

171
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,789
so look if it's positive if it's stay
positive

172
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
positive
 

173
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,309
positive
does it change um

174
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
does it change um
 

175
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,190
does it change um
does it change come on two to two or two

176
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
does it change come on two to two or two
 

177
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,750
does it change come on two to two or two
to

178
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
to
 

179
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,070
to
one minute it doesn't change if it's

180
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
one minute it doesn't change if it's
 

181
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,990
one minute it doesn't change if it's
still if it's still negative

182
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
still if it's still negative
 

183
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,149
still if it's still negative
it doesn't change the only change is

184
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
it doesn't change the only change is
 

185
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,990
it doesn't change the only change is
that if it's going from a positive to

186
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
that if it's going from a positive to
 

187
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,710
that if it's going from a positive to
negative

188
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
negative
 

189
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,710
negative
or if it goes to the negative to

190
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
or if it goes to the negative to
 

191
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,869
or if it goes to the negative to
positive if the sign has changed

192
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
positive if the sign has changed
 

193
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,509
positive if the sign has changed
remember we

194
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
remember we
 

195
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,390
remember we
talked about the sign oh yeah if the

196
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
talked about the sign oh yeah if the
 

197
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,309
talked about the sign oh yeah if the
sign has changed remember what sign

198
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
sign has changed remember what sign
 

199
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,750
sign has changed remember what sign
let's say the sine function positive x

200
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
let's say the sine function positive x
 

201
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,830
let's say the sine function positive x
sine sine function what is the equal

202
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
sine sine function what is the equal
 

203
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,509
sine sine function what is the equal
look we can say

204
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
look we can say
 

205
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,670
look we can say
let's say okay what's the sine function

206
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
let's say okay what's the sine function
 

207
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,470
let's say okay what's the sine function
sine function yeah second function x

208
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
sine function yeah second function x
 

209
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,149
sine function yeah second function x
what does it equal

210
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
what does it equal
 

211
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,030
what does it equal
if it's one it has three possibilities

212
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
if it's one it has three possibilities
 

213
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,590
if it's one it has three possibilities
three

214
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
three
 

215
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,349
three
one zero and one and one zero and one

216
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
one zero and one and one zero and one
 

217
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,870
one zero and one and one zero and one
minus one right yeah

218
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
minus one right yeah
 

219
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,830
minus one right yeah
if this is if x bigger than zero what's

220
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840
if this is if x bigger than zero what's
 

221
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,150
if this is if x bigger than zero what's
this

222
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
this
 

223
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,830
this
x y and what come on tell me x

224
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
x y and what come on tell me x
 

225
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,629
x y and what come on tell me x
which is zero zero equals zero and then

226
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
which is zero zero equals zero and then
 

227
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,070
which is zero zero equals zero and then
x

228
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
x
 

229
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,070
x
uh smaller than zero okay okay so

230
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
uh smaller than zero okay okay so
 

231
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,830
uh smaller than zero okay okay so
so is the difference span if we say sun

232
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
so is the difference span if we say sun
 

233
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,749
so is the difference span if we say sun
data data data means that

234
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
data data data means that
 

235
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,230
data data data means that
why are you using the triangle yeah

236
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
why are you using the triangle yeah
 

237
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,070
why are you using the triangle yeah
that's what it means data that data

238
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
that's what it means data that data
 

239
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,950
that's what it means data that data
means the difference

240
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
means the difference
 

241
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,990
means the difference
data data

242
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
data data
 

243
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,390
data data
sin delta x what

244
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
sin delta x what
 

245
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,909
sin delta x what
sine theta x is

246
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
sine theta x is
 

247
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,830
sine theta x is
is um look

248
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
is um look
 

249
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,310
is um look
maybe some data okay so

250
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
maybe some data okay so
 

251
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,310
maybe some data okay so
theta x one x two

252
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
theta x one x two
 

253
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,830
theta x one x two
can we write it if it's smaller than

254
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
can we write it if it's smaller than
 

255
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,710
can we write it if it's smaller than
zero so how can we interpret this

256
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
zero so how can we interpret this
 

257
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,990
zero so how can we interpret this
so look uh let's

258
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
so look uh let's
 

259
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,270
so look uh let's
go back to that one three five

260
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
go back to that one three five
 

261
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,790
go back to that one three five
three one okay

262
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
three one okay
 

263
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,749
three one okay
if we we talk about if this is currently

264
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
if we we talk about if this is currently
 

265
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,469
if we we talk about if this is currently
if we talk about

266
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
if we talk about
 

267
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,590
if we talk about
this is data x1 and if this is

268
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
this is data x1 and if this is
 

269
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,189
this is data x1 and if this is
delta x2 so look so

270
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
delta x2 so look so
 

271
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,710
delta x2 so look so
if delta x1 times data x2 the difference

272
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
if delta x1 times data x2 the difference
 

273
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,430
if delta x1 times data x2 the difference
is smaller than 0 means the sign has

274
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
is smaller than 0 means the sign has
 

275
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,990
is smaller than 0 means the sign has
changed then it must copy be counted

276
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
changed then it must copy be counted
 

277
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,469
changed then it must copy be counted
as one direction change right so if

278
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
as one direction change right so if
 

279
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,990
as one direction change right so if
we're going through this

280
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
we're going through this
 

281
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,350
we're going through this
array numbers by keep checking of the

282
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
array numbers by keep checking of the
 

283
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,309
array numbers by keep checking of the
current

284
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
current
 

285
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,830
current
data data x and then we check the

286
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
data data x and then we check the
 

287
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,029
data data x and then we check the
next data data okay data and if

288
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
next data data okay data and if
 

289
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,189
next data data okay data and if
the sign has changed then we increment

290
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
the sign has changed then we increment
 

291
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,189
the sign has changed then we increment
one okay

292
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
one okay
 

293
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,990
one okay
okay let's do this

294
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000

 

295
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,790

define define uh chain

296
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
define define uh chain
 

297
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,510
define define uh chain
changing direction or they're changing

298
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
changing direction or they're changing
 

299
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,070
changing direction or they're changing
let's just

300
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
let's just
 

301
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,350
let's just
changing the numbers okay in the

302
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360
changing the numbers okay in the
 

303
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,909
changing the numbers okay in the
beginning

304
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
beginning
 

305
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,430
beginning
n equals length numbers yeah we just

306
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
n equals length numbers yeah we just
 

307
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:40,020
n equals length numbers yeah we just
what does it mean yeah

308
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,030

 

309
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,870

[Music]

310
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880

 

311
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,710

okay so if n is smaller or equal

312
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
okay so if n is smaller or equal
 

313
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,749
okay so if n is smaller or equal
too what does it mean if only there are

314
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
too what does it mean if only there are
 

315
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,350
too what does it mean if only there are
two numbers or less

316
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
two numbers or less
 

317
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,110
two numbers or less
and what should we return number of

318
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
and what should we return number of
 

319
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,469
and what should we return number of
changing if

320
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
changing if
 

321
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,150
changing if
there are two numbers or less we turn

322
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
there are two numbers or less we turn
 

323
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,830
there are two numbers or less we turn
around

324
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840

 

325
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,990

yeah yeah of course because two numbers

326
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
yeah yeah of course because two numbers
 

327
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,670
yeah yeah of course because two numbers
there's no changing line you can't find

328
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
there's no changing line you can't find
 

329
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,870
there's no changing line you can't find
any change right

330
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
any change right
 

331
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,070
any change right
right all right okay okay now the

332
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
right all right okay okay now the
 

333
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,589
right all right okay okay now the
current data okay come on let's say

334
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
current data okay come on let's say
 

335
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,749
current data okay come on let's say
how about let's we call it slow okay you

336
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
how about let's we call it slow okay you
 

337
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,510
how about let's we call it slow okay you
want a slope

338
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
want a slope
 

339
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,070
want a slope
if it is going up that's positive

340
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
if it is going up that's positive
 

341
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,350
if it is going up that's positive
positive

342
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
positive
 

343
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,749
positive
positive if it's going down that's

344
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
positive if it's going down that's
 

345
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,390
positive if it's going down that's
negative

346
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
negative
 

347
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,070
negative
if you're going straight let's call it

348
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
if you're going straight let's call it
 

349
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,510
if you're going straight let's call it
zero okay slope

350
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
zero okay slope
 

351
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,550
zero okay slope
got it the longest

352
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:31,560

 

353
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:39,480

this is on the swing you go up okay okay

358
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
this is on the swing you go up okay okay
 

359
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,629
this is on the swing you go up okay okay
so slow what does it mean

360
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
so slow what does it mean
 

361
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,869
so slow what does it mean
what look at that they are numbers

362
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
what look at that they are numbers
 

363
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,230
what look at that they are numbers
they're numbers

364
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
they're numbers
 

365
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,550
they're numbers
numbers okay that's there's one three

366
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
numbers okay that's there's one three
 

367
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,990
numbers okay that's there's one three
five seven

368
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
five seven
 

369
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,990
five seven
four five five four okay so so

370
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
four five five four okay so so
 

371
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,150
four five five four okay so so
the beginning would be which one the

372
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
the beginning would be which one the
 

373
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,070
the beginning would be which one the
beginning let's level

374
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
beginning let's level
 

375
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,390
beginning let's level
sorry the slope slope going up

376
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
sorry the slope slope going up
 

377
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,550
sorry the slope slope going up
three three minus one come on three

378
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
three three minus one come on three
 

379
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,550
three three minus one come on three
minus one and then five minus three

380
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
minus one and then five minus three
 

381
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,110
minus one and then five minus three
hundred

382
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
hundred
 

383
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,510
hundred
okay look so we we just use the numbers

384
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
okay look so we we just use the numbers
 

385
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,150
okay look so we we just use the numbers
yeah uh

386
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
yeah uh
 

387
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,350
yeah uh
let's say numbers one minus one

388
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
let's say numbers one minus one
 

389
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,110
let's say numbers one minus one
one minus numbers

390
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
one minus numbers
 

391
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,150
one minus numbers
uh zero yeah then

392
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
uh zero yeah then
 

393
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,270
uh zero yeah then
let's start with which number for i

394
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
let's start with which number for i
 

395
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,589
let's start with which number for i
in branch range what

396
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:31,599
in branch range what
 

397
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,469
in branch range what
when you are now we know this is current

398
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
when you are now we know this is current
 

399
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,589
when you are now we know this is current
stove yeah

400
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
stove yeah
 

401
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,870
stove yeah
so now we need to start with which one

402
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
so now we need to start with which one
 

403
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,550
so now we need to start with which one
let's start here right five minus three

404
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
let's start here right five minus three
 

405
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,190
let's start here right five minus three
yeah so and n equals well i equals one

406
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
yeah so and n equals well i equals one
 

407
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,070
yeah so and n equals well i equals one
zero one

408
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
zero one
 

409
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,829
zero one
what's this i was doing five

410
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
what's this i was doing five
 

411
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,990
what's this i was doing five
the index the index zero one was three

412
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
the index the index zero one was three
 

413
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,190
the index the index zero one was three
to n and then common let's say

414
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
to n and then common let's say
 

415
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,630
to n and then common let's say
current current slope current slope

416
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
current current slope current slope
 

417
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:21,190
current current slope current slope
equals life equals

418
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200

 

419
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,190

this is i current lands i mine as well

420
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
this is i current lands i mine as well
 

421
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,110
this is i current lands i mine as well
uh minus one i minus one okay

422
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
uh minus one i minus one okay
 

423
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,150
uh minus one i minus one okay
okay and then we we know this is lower

424
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
okay and then we we know this is lower
 

425
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,269
okay and then we we know this is lower
yeah

426
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
yeah
 

427
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,470
yeah
this is slow and this is current slow so

428
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
this is slow and this is current slow so
 

429
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,030
this is slow and this is current slow so
if current slow

430
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
if current slow
 

431
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,949
if current slow
what current stop and the slope times

432
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
what current stop and the slope times
 

433
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,790
what current stop and the slope times
it together even if it's one if it's one

434
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
it together even if it's one if it's one
 

435
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,070
it together even if it's one if it's one
if if it's what then we

436
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
if if it's what then we
 

437
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,110
if if it's what then we
uh let's answer here and equal zero and

438
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
uh let's answer here and equal zero and
 

439
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,470
uh let's answer here and equal zero and
the plus equals one

440
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
the plus equals one
 

441
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,190
the plus equals one
so what should i put here if current

442
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
so what should i put here if current
 

443
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,389
so what should i put here if current
swing

444
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
swing
 

445
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,430
swing
and and slope times together yeah

446
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
and and slope times together yeah
 

447
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,710
and and slope times together yeah
multiply

448
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
multiply
 

449
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,910
multiply
if current is like times slope

450
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920

 

451
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,670

why is it times why y is not times look

452
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
why is it times why y is not times look
 

453
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,710
why is it times why y is not times look
if it's this

454
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
if it's this
 

455
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,150
if it's this
2 5 minus 3 is 2 times 3 minus

456
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
2 5 minus 3 is 2 times 3 minus
 

457
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,069
2 5 minus 3 is 2 times 3 minus
1 is 1 so it's going up right

458
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
1 is 1 so it's going up right
 

459
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,910
1 is 1 so it's going up right
yeah yeah so how about look if it's

460
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
yeah yeah so how about look if it's
 

461
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,949
yeah yeah so how about look if it's
if d here 5 to 7 that's 2

462
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
if d here 5 to 7 that's 2
 

463
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,069
if d here 5 to 7 that's 2
2 5 minus 7 minus three

464
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
2 5 minus 7 minus three
 

465
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,829
2 5 minus 7 minus three
minus three is smaller than zero so we

466
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
minus three is smaller than zero so we
 

467
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,829
minus three is smaller than zero so we
are looking for a minus zero yeah

468
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
are looking for a minus zero yeah
 

469
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,550
are looking for a minus zero yeah
changing remember this is changing it's

470
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
changing remember this is changing it's
 

471
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,590
changing remember this is changing it's
smaller than zero

472
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
smaller than zero
 

473
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,670
smaller than zero
yes smaller than zero okay and then

474
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
yes smaller than zero okay and then
 

475
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,110
yes smaller than zero okay and then
after this should

476
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
after this should
 

477
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,230
after this should
what should i do is to change the slope

478
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
what should i do is to change the slope
 

479
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,710
what should i do is to change the slope
so if i look the next one will be moving

480
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
so if i look the next one will be moving
 

481
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,590
so if i look the next one will be moving
right

482
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
right
 

483
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,829
right
so what happened to the slope what

484
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
so what happened to the slope what
 

485
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,509
so what happened to the slope what
happened to us though

486
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
happened to us though
 

487
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,829
happened to us though
it's like we um no no no

488
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839
it's like we um no no no
 

489
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,550
it's like we um no no no
no slow

490
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
no slow
 

491
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,949
no slow
current slow and then move to the next

492
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
current slow and then move to the next
 

493
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,550
current slow and then move to the next
one what happened

494
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
one what happened
 

495
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,069
one what happened
what's slow now look look how he is

496
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,079
what's slow now look look how he is
 

497
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,110
what's slow now look look how he is
there slope

498
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
there slope
 

499
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,509
there slope
current slope and the next iteration

500
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
current slope and the next iteration
 

501
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,190
current slope and the next iteration
what happened to the slope what happened

502
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
what happened to the slope what happened
 

503
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,509
what happened to the slope what happened
to this slow current slow

504
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
to this slow current slow
 

505
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,150
to this slow current slow
it means that yeah and what was slope

506
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
it means that yeah and what was slope
 

507
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,710
it means that yeah and what was slope
equals

508
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
equals
 

509
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,110
equals
it's not equal to one because slope is

510
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
it's not equal to one because slope is
 

511
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,829
it's not equal to one because slope is
used in the next iteration

512
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
used in the next iteration
 

513
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,190
used in the next iteration
no no no current slow slow what happened

514
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
no no no current slow slow what happened
 

515
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,509
no no no current slow slow what happened
to the slope

516
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
to the slope
 

517
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,990
to the slope
slope here and you move to here slow

518
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
slope here and you move to here slow
 

519
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,550
slope here and you move to here slow
slope

520
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
slope
 

521
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,670
slope
is always the previous slope of

522
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
is always the previous slope of
 

523
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,430
is always the previous slope of
current slope right so slope equals what

524
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
current slope right so slope equals what
 

525
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,310
current slope right so slope equals what
previous like we we try this previous

526
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
previous like we we try this previous
 

527
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,310
previous like we we try this previous
note if it goes to the next internet

528
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
note if it goes to the next internet
 

529
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,990
note if it goes to the next internet
yeah that's what i mean current slow

530
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
yeah that's what i mean current slow
 

531
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,910
yeah that's what i mean current slow
yeah

532
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
yeah
 

533
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,829
yeah
all right and then there's one thing

534
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839
all right and then there's one thing
 

535
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:08,829
all right and then there's one thing
missing

536
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839

 

537
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:16,550

oh

538
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560

 

539
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,949

give me a give me a give me a number oh

540
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
give me a give me a give me a number oh
 

541
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,350
give me a give me a give me a number oh
letter come on

542
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
letter come on
 

543
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:32,150
letter come on
what's the space go backstage

544
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160

 

545
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,030

you're not using any uh space that's

546
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
you're not using any uh space that's
 

547
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,710
you're not using any uh space that's
nine year then

548
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
nine year then
 

549
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,389
nine year then
actually we are using space but this is

550
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
actually we are using space but this is
 

551
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,629
actually we are using space but this is
constant space that's why we say one

552
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
constant space that's why we say one
 

553
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,110
constant space that's why we say one
yeah but

554
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
yeah but
 

555
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,110
yeah but
we're not using a ray or something that

556
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
we're not using a ray or something that
 

557
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,269
we're not using a ray or something that
is linear with the number of

558
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
is linear with the number of
 

559
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,829
is linear with the number of
the number of things yeah

560
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839

 

561
00:12:50,839 --> 00:13:04,470

okay

562
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480

 

563
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,990

you need to understand okay it's not

564
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
you need to understand okay it's not
 

565
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,870
you need to understand okay it's not
equal as well

566
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880

 

567
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,629

come on

568
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639

 

569
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,190

yeah look remember slope coming slow

570
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
yeah look remember slope coming slow
 

571
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,470
yeah look remember slope coming slow
moving to the next next

572
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
moving to the next next
 

573
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,990
moving to the next next
next yeah kind of stuff will be equal to

574
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
next yeah kind of stuff will be equal to
 

575
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,750
next yeah kind of stuff will be equal to
the previous level which is the current

576
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
the previous level which is the current
 

577
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,590
the previous level which is the current
stop in each iteration right

578
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
stop in each iteration right
 

579
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,430
stop in each iteration right
because going to the next one right

580
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
because going to the next one right
 

581
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,430
because going to the next one right
going to the next one the current slope

582
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440
going to the next one the current slope
 

583
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,710
going to the next one the current slope
will be become

584
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
will be become
 

585
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,509
will be become
previously actually this slope should be

586
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
previously actually this slope should be
 

587
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,269
previously actually this slope should be
called the previous low

588
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
called the previous low
 

589
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,230
called the previous low
okay what the mean time what that's how

590
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
okay what the mean time what that's how
 

591
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,230
okay what the mean time what that's how
i do my time

592
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
i do my time
 

593
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,790
i do my time
isn't that time yeah yeah yeah but here

594
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
isn't that time yeah yeah yeah but here
 

595
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,629
isn't that time yeah yeah yeah but here
this is one into the time here

596
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
this is one into the time here
 

597
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,150
this is one into the time here
okay and here what should i do

598
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
okay and here what should i do
 

599
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,509
okay and here what should i do
it's like sorry what do you mean here

600
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
it's like sorry what do you mean here
 

601
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:49,829
it's like sorry what do you mean here
what

602
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
what
 

603
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,670
what
that's in that's it

604
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680

 

605
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,990

so what's missing here come on if we

606
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
so what's missing here come on if we
 

607
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,710
so what's missing here come on if we
change you if we're changing this level

608
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
change you if we're changing this level
 

609
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,150
change you if we're changing this level
we're going up and we're going down

610
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
we're going up and we're going down
 

611
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,670
we're going up and we're going down
down yeah so look previous levels

612
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
down yeah so look previous levels
 

613
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,949
down yeah so look previous levels
kind of slope it times them

614
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
kind of slope it times them
 

615
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,990
kind of slope it times them
yeah if it turns them is what then

616
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000

 

617
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,509

yeah come come

618
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519

 

619
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,110

come on you really need to understand

620
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
come on you really need to understand
 

621
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,590
come on you really need to understand
otherwise he's always forgetting

622
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600

 

623
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,310

this is slope this is current slope so

624
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
this is slope this is current slope so
 

625
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,350
this is slope this is current slope so
the two numbers

626
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
the two numbers
 

627
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,790
the two numbers
if that if how do you check it

628
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
if that if how do you check it
 

629
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,710
if that if how do you check it
yeah come on write it faster come on

630
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
yeah come on write it faster come on
 

631
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,670
yeah come on write it faster come on
you're too slow kind of slow yeah yeah

632
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
you're too slow kind of slow yeah yeah
 

633
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,310
you're too slow kind of slow yeah yeah
times yeah times one

634
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
times yeah times one
 

635
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,949
times yeah times one
slow yeah and what happened if these two

636
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:44,959
slow yeah and what happened if these two
 

637
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:45,509
slow yeah and what happened if these two
slope

638
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
slope
 

639
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,590
slope
if one going up one going down or one

640
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
if one going up one going down or one
 

641
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,110
if one going up one going down or one
going down one going up

642
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
going down one going up
 

643
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,470
going down one going up
what happened if it is changing

644
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
what happened if it is changing
 

645
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,310
what happened if it is changing
direction if it's smaller than zero

646
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
direction if it's smaller than zero
 

647
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,710
direction if it's smaller than zero
right

648
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
right
 

649
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,030
right
and what we count it as a change in

650
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
and what we count it as a change in
 

651
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,389
and what we count it as a change in
direction which is

652
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
direction which is
 

653
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,150
direction which is
which value very obviously

654
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160

 

655
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,430

plus yes that's what it means yeah okay

656
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440
plus yes that's what it means yeah okay
 

657
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,069
plus yes that's what it means yeah okay
that's it that's it for today thank you

658
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
that's it that's it for today thank you
 

659
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,870
that's it that's it for today thank you
bye bye

660
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
bye bye
 

661
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,079
bye bye
okay hi
