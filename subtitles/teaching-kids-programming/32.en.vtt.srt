okay so today we're going to talk about
 

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,029
okay so today we're going to talk about
the sum of the first and

00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
the sum of the first and
 

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,990
the sum of the first and
numbers okay some we already know this

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:26,000

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,510
okay okay wait wait wait wait no you
have no yeah let's talk

20
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
have no yeah let's talk
 

21
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,430
have no yeah let's talk
please if you want to release okay so

22
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
please if you want to release okay so
 

23
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,190
please if you want to release okay so
look the first one number the sum

24
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
look the first one number the sum
 

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,470
look the first one number the sum
is what one the first four

26
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
is what one the first four
 

27
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,790
is what one the first four
all numbers four you just

28
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
all numbers four you just
 

29
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,229
all numbers four you just
square it wow how do you know

30
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
square it wow how do you know
 

31
00:00:52,239 --> 00:01:00,069
square it wow how do you know
that's nine right and what's next

32
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079

 

33
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,430

you see obviously you can have this one

34
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
you see obviously you can have this one
 

35
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,509
you see obviously you can have this one
less one square not two numbers two

36
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
less one square not two numbers two
 

37
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,350
less one square not two numbers two
squares three number three square

38
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
squares three number three square
 

39
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,109
squares three number three square
four number is four squared so that's

40
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
four number is four squared so that's
 

41
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,610
four number is four squared so that's
the trick yeah

42
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:15,620

we want to add the number so what's what

54
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040

 

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,870

okay so what's the time complexity of

56
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
okay so what's the time complexity of
 

57
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,830
okay so what's the time complexity of
this algorithm

58
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840

 

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,910

do we need the extra space to store this

60
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
do we need the extra space to store this
 

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,430
do we need the extra space to store this
what's the space complexity

62
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
what's the space complexity
 

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,830
what's the space complexity
no we don't need any space a one or one

64
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840
no we don't need any space a one or one
 

65
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,030
no we don't need any space a one or one
constant okay now if i

66
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
constant okay now if i
 

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,589
constant okay now if i
have another function g to calculate two

68
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
have another function g to calculate two
 

69
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,790
have another function g to calculate two
less than c

70
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
less than c
 

71
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,550
less than c
we tan n times n

72
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
we tan n times n
 

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,949
we tan n times n
so what's the time complexity yeah

74
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
so what's the time complexity yeah
 

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,110
so what's the time complexity yeah
what's the time complexity

76
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
what's the time complexity
 

77
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,470
what's the time complexity
what's the space complexity

78
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
what's the space complexity
 

79
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,869
what's the space complexity
and one one or one as well because we

80
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
and one one or one as well because we
 

81
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,710
and one one or one as well because we
don't need any space so which one is

82
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
don't need any space so which one is
 

83
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,190
don't need any space so which one is
better

84
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200

 

85
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,309

it's um it's quicker because if i if the

86
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
it's um it's quicker because if i if the
 

87
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:52,550
it's um it's quicker because if i if the

n
 

89
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,430
n
is one million then you have to get one

90
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
is one million then you have to get one
 

91
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:55,910

prove that the formula is correct by
 

109
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,149
prove that the formula is correct by
using the mathematic induction remember

110
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
using the mathematic induction remember
 

111
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,589
using the mathematic induction remember
a few days ago we talked about

112
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
a few days ago we talked about
 

113
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,430
a few days ago we talked about
mathematic induction yeah

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
mathematic induction yeah
 

115
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,270
mathematic induction yeah
induction this is going to take forever

116
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
induction this is going to take forever
 

117
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,149
induction this is going to take forever
you say that every time

00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159

 

119
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,190

okay now so the formula is f of

120
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
okay now so the formula is f of
 

121
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,110
okay now so the formula is f of
n equals n times n right yeah yes

122
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
n equals n times n right yeah yes
 

123
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,750
n equals n times n right yeah yes
and what's the base case f1 equals one

124
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
and what's the base case f1 equals one
 

125
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:54,790
and what's the base case f1 equals one
walking around

f k plus one is still correct so this

130
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
f k plus one is still correct so this
 

131
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,429
f k plus one is still correct so this
is f k plus one equals f k

132
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
is f k plus one equals f k
 

133
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,070
is f k plus one equals f k
and then we just need to one more add

134
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
and then we just need to one more add
 

135
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,270

is one two three it's basically the
 

143
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,590
is one two three it's basically the

144
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
first so let's k
 

145
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,430

k plus one uh k plus one
 

147
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,629

k
 

151
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,310
k
plus 1 right right look if k is 1

152
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
plus 1 right right look if k is 1
 

153
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,430
plus 1 right right look if k is 1
and the next k next whole number is what

154
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
and the next k next whole number is what
 

155
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,070
and the next k next whole number is what
if k is 1 the next whole number will be

156
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
if k is 1 the next whole number will be
 

157
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,550
if k is 1 the next whole number will be
3

158
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
3
 

159
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,550
3
if k is 2 the next whole number is

160
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
if k is 2 the next whole number is
 

161
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,909
if k is 2 the next whole number is
the second let's if k

162
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
the second let's if k
 

163
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,749
the second let's if k
is two so the third odd number will be

164
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
is two so the third odd number will be
 

165
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,030
is two so the third odd number will be
one

five yes five right
 

169
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,189
five yes five right
right yeah because the 8k is two then

170
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
right yeah because the 8k is two then
 

171
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,830
right yeah because the 8k is two then
the first

172
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
the first
 

173
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,150
the first
one second will be one third and the

174
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
one second will be one third and the
 

175
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,590
one second will be one third and the
third one will be right right

176
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
third one will be right right
 

177
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,150
third one will be right right
so we now have length sorry

178
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
so we now have length sorry
 

179
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,790
so we now have length sorry
fk equals k times k right yeah plus 2k

180
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:10,800
fk equals k times k right yeah plus 2k
 

181
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,320
fk equals k times k right yeah plus 2k
plus one

182
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,330
plus one
 

183

ym so this
is what this is actually k plus one

188
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
is what this is actually k plus one
 

189
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,110
is what this is actually k plus one
square right why are we doing why

190
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
square right why are we doing why
 

191
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,950
square right why are we doing why
because i want to prove letter

192
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
because i want to prove letter
 

193
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,469

a square plus

250
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
a square plus
 

251
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,710
a square plus
a plus b squared equals a squared plus

252
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
a plus b squared equals a squared plus
 

253
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,830
a plus b squared equals a squared plus
squared plus 2a b

254

squared plus 2a b
 

255
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,670
squared plus 2a b
so look k square k squared

256
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
so look k square k squared
 

257
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,270
so look k square k squared
1 2 times k 1 so look so what we have

258
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
1 2 times k 1 so look so what we have
 

259
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,589
1 2 times k 1 so look so what we have
done

260
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
done
 

261
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,870
done
is that we prove that f k plus 1 equals

262
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
is that we prove that f k plus 1 equals
 

263
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,510
is that we prove that f k plus 1 equals
k plus 1 square so this formula stands

264
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
k plus 1 square so this formula stands
 

265
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,230
k plus 1 square so this formula stands
yeah

266
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
yeah
 

267
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,710
yeah
so we have to prove that the first all n

268
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
so we have to prove that the first all n
 

269
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,830
so we have to prove that the first all n
all numbers the sum

270
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
all numbers the sum
 

271
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,950
all numbers the sum
is is what n times n

272
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
is is what n times n
 

273
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,710
is is what n times n
all right yes so any questions

274
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
all right yes so any questions
