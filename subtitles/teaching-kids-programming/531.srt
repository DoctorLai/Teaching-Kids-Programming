1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
foreign

2
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,300
16a 16 divided by a remaining zero one

3
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,480
is remaining zero this is the greatest

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,660
common division 24 and 32 what's the

5
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,480
greatest common divisor uh is it um

6
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,340
eight eight yes how to do it 24 divided

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,160
by 32 remaining 24 move it here 50 32

8
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,860
24. so basically when a is smaller than

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:01,500
b we just swap it around 32 divided by

10
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:05,100
24 remaining eight right look 34 8

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,020
24 divided by a remaining zero what is

12
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,479
the remaining zeros this is eight okay

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,119
this is the way we calculate the

14
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,760
greatest common divisor and do you still

15
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:19,619
remember this and SCM

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:25,520
please comment multiples okay what's the

17
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,520
least common multiple of uh 16 and 24.

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:36,180
so you basically

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:40,979
a million no no 32 144 48 million what

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:44,100
40a am I so it's 48 am I 48 is because

21
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,380
how do we get it for the a so 16 times

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,860
24 divided by the greatest common

23
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:53,520
divisor of both

24
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:56,759
this is a right so look so it's 16 times

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,860
24 divided by 8 so that's 48 that's how

26
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,020
we get the least common multiple so

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,240
basically this common multiple of two

28
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:09,899
number A B can be calculated as a times

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:14,340
B divided by g c d a b so y uh B is not

30
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:16,440
equal zero a b equals B A modulus B okay

31
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,800
and then return

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:24,300
return a okay at least can be done in a

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:27,200
recursion so Define gcp a b if B

34
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:31,260
okay if B return

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,200
gcp B A modulus B

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,940
otherwise return a okay so that's the

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,920
recursion that's the iterative coming

38
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,080
back to today's problem so we're given

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,400
an array we are given an array right

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,920
array

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,560
we want to find out the minimum splits

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,300
of these numbers so we want to split the

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,739
numbers into continuous groups start

44
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,540
away subtle right we talk about sub

45
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,340
array and sub list right Subaru and

46
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,959
subjects are continuous subsequence is

47
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,440
not continuous so in some ways of

48
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,780
continuous so we want to split the

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,860
array into sub arrays each number

50
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,739
belongs to one Subway only and then each

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,840
group each group The GCB the greatest

52
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,440
common divisor of all of it

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:18,060
is is more than one if two numbers the

54
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,700
GCB A and B if we equal equal one right

55
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,620
for example like three and seven the gcd

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,200
of three and seven is one

57
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,780
then we can say that three and seven are

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,819
Co Prime co Prime

59
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,580
pillow plant because their greatest

60
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,739
common devices is one okay so coming

61
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,379
back to this question so we want to find

62
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,360
out the minimum split minimum means

63
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:42,360
split of separate

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,000
other ways so that the greatest common

65
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,940
divisor of the numbers in each group is

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,540
more than one twelve six three what's

67
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,220
the greatest common divisor of this

68
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,440
three yeah three it's more than one

69
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,739
what's the common divisor of this

70
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,019
two right so yeah bigger than one bigger

71
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,780
than one if 14 in the first group what's

72
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,140
the greatest common divisor of of these

73
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,299
these four numbers one yeah so it is not

74
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,220
satisfy the requirement all right so we

75
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,500
want to find out the minimum speed the

76
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,900
subway is continuous so we can do this

77
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,760
uh greatly right what's the idea what's

78
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,340
the what's the idea we can apply in the

79
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,740
greedy agreement if we can include the

80
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,540
next number in the sub array

81
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,540
or include it right

82
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,940
bless you again okay

83
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,460
so look prayer we can do this book 12.

84
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,560
the greatest common divisor 12 right 6

85
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,720
12 and 6 squared is common divisor which

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,360
is six am I

87
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,000
it's still bigger than one one three

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,520
question divided by three so look when

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,300
we are at 12 and 6 the next number is

90
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,540
three

91
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,699
all right but including the next number

92
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,320
our greatest common divisor of current

93
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,259
group is still bigger than one still

94
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,540
means the requirements so we can just

95
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:04,620
take it all right because when we take

96
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:06,060
it it does not compromise the global the

97
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,639
optimal solution because we are looking

98
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,639
for the Minimus break if we can include

99
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,759
the next number in the current group we

100
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,560
do not compromise the global Optima does

101
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,240
it make sense yeah because we are

102
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,580
looking for a Minimus break minimum

103
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,460
spray what does it mean minimum speed so

104
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,539
we want to include as many numbers as

105
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:29,520
possible in the current group make sense

106
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:31,320
so this is uh this is the green thing so

107
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,360
we want to find out the minimum split

108
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,580
minimum split right so we want to

109
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,919
minimum speed that means that we want to

110
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,500
have as many numbers as possible in the

111
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,919
current group as long as it does satisfy

112
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,080
the requirement right so look 12.6 my

113
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,900
current group is 12 and 6. so by

114
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,360
including the next number

115
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,479
which brings the GCT to three it stays

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,400
good so we want to take it right am I

117
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,620
right it's better we take it if we not

118
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,720
take it we leave it to the next group

119
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,900
things may get worse I mean right let's

120
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,380
create it okay what's great strategy is

121
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,419
that you always make a decision and in

122
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,180
the best of your entry at the coloring

123
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:15,000
point right you'll have a bananas 10

124
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,460
bananas you can have six bananas now and

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,520
four later or you can have four bananas

126
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,039
now or six later on the greedy strategy

127
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,020
you always pick them the best strategy

128
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,199
at your point which is six right Ryan

129
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,860
you'll pick six now right

130
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:35,460
Define mean spirit

131
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,639
okay so at the beginning answer equals

132
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,199
yellow carbon gcd and let's send it to

133
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,199
one okay we can go through the numbers

134
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:46,280
what does it mean in numerate

135
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,419
or doesn't like cheese and values so for

136
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,300
example like uh a b c okay if we

137
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:01,800
enumerate it it will become zero a

138
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:04,860
that's a Tapper okay and one b

139
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,600
two c okay so the key is here this is

140
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,060
the template okay actually it's no keys

141
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,180
but it's the first element in a couple

142
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,759
is the index the second value uh in the

143
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,500
table is the actual value okay so we go

144
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:22,319
to i j in enumerate

145
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,360
uh array okay

146
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,720
all away

147
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:32,099
so now we have to check we have to apply

148
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:36,660
the current current equals gcd carbon

149
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:39,120
and J J right and if carbon if the gcd

150
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,280
is one if electricity is what means that

151
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,080
this number needs to be in the next

152
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,940
group not this group because the

153
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,340
greatest common divisor of all the

154
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,740
numbers up to now this group is one so

155
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,080
we can't include this number

156
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,060
and index I right so we have to

157
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,780
increment the answer we need one more

158
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:00,599
group one more split and the current we

159
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:05,360
need to set it to this new number J here

160
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:09,000
right and at the end we do 10 and 12 6 3

161
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,759
and then 14 uh seven right I think this

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,120
this was the example okay so look answer

163
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,560
equals zero and gcd equals one the

164
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,340
current equals one

165
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,720
12 plus 1 and 12 gcd is one so we need

166
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,139
to increment the answer

167
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,020
and gcd set to 12 the current set to 12.

168
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,160
12 and 6 the greatest common divisor

169
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,199
becomes six

170
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,140
right becomes 6 is not equals one then

171
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,120
we continue six and six and three the

172
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,279
greatest common divisor becomes three

173
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,440
is three bigger than one okay now three

174
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,839
and fourteen look quantities common

175
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,760
divisor becomes one right becomes one so

176
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,040
what happened we plus one here answer

177
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,899
plus one right and then we set the

178
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,560
greatest common divisor here to 14.

179
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,560
right 14.

180
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:04,220
make sense

181
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,220
what's the

182
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,540
that's a good guess this is our an

183
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,640
obviously but here

184
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,959
gcp we talk about ggd the complexity of

185
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:18,480
gcd

186
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:20,880
uh AP is block the minimum of a b okay

187
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,839
okay so this is kind of that we have to

188
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:28,200
take it into consideration that o n

189
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,700
times gcd leaves or n Times login maybe

190
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,760
11 times

191
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,760
block but okay

192
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
okay

193
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,700
this is the upper bound okay in practice

194
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,540
speaking Yeah they come to the next

195
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:47,300
thing this is very fast okay but we have

196
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:51,959
these numbers yeah and we go

197
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:54,779
flip them into groups yes and then the

198
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,899
requirement of each group is is

199
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:00,420
the greatest common divisor of them is

200
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,399
it must be strictly greater than one

201
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:06,180
what's the key word today what's the

202
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,160
strategy pretty yes we saw yeah okay so

203
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,940
how how do we interpret this query they

204
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,540
think

205
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,700
so if the next number yeah even the next

206
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,920
number we can include it in the current

207
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,300
group we might just take it okay well

208
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:23,100
space complexity is a one constant right

209
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,200
this strategy is uh very popular it's

210
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,480
one of the classic algorithm in computer

211
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,000
science so it means that you always

212
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,700
choose yeah best choice at that point

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,860
you don't consider somehow in the future

214
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,180
they have six banana and four bananas in

215
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,120
front of you you don't care what

216
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,060
happened next you just pick the best LED

217
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,500
Point that's greedy okay yeah

218
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,929
okay that's it for today bye bye

219
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,929
