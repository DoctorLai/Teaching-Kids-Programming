65
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,630
what does it do what's the root one one
and how many binary of you have okay it

66
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
and how many binary of you have okay it
 

67
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,510
and how many binary of you have okay it
doesn't have performance

68
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
doesn't have performance
 

69
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,230

only one root in the final three okay

70
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
only one root in the final three okay
 

71
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,350
only one root in the final three okay
yes does it make sense

72
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
yes does it make sense
 

73
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,030
yes does it make sense
yes okay so now look if you cut with

74
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
yes okay so now look if you cut with
 

75
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,109
yes okay so now look if you cut with
we see the numbers from the root to the

76
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
we see the numbers from the root to the
 

77
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,830
we see the numbers from the root to the
leaf so what's this

78
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
leaf so what's this
 

79
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,310
leaf so what's this
if you if you get the numbers

80
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,320
if you if you get the numbers
 

81
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,910
if you if you get the numbers
continuously from the root to the 12.

82
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
continuously from the root to the 12.
 

83
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,830
continuously from the root to the 12.
it's not no i'm saying that

84
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
it's not no i'm saying that
 

85
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,910
it's not no i'm saying that
192 okay and at least

86
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
192 okay and at least
 

87
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,869
192 okay and at least
18 18 plus 18 so you've got

88
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
18 18 plus 18 so you've got
 

89
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,630
18 18 plus 18 so you've got
210 right yeah okay so this

90
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
210 right yeah okay so this
 

91
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,190
210 right yeah okay so this
is the task for today so we we first of

92
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
is the task for today so we we first of
 

93
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,550
is the task for today so we we first of
all we get the

94
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
all we get the
 

95
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,750
all we get the
least numbers from the root to the leaf

96
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
least numbers from the root to the leaf
 

97
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,830
least numbers from the root to the leaf
and then we sum it together okay does it

98
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
and then we sum it together okay does it
 

99
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,110
and then we sum it together okay does it
make sense

100
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
make sense
 

101
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,030
make sense
yeah so any idea how we can do it

102
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
yeah so any idea how we can do it
 

103
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,110
yeah so any idea how we can do it

00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
can you draw a tree or can you think of
 

145
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,149
can you draw a tree or can you think of
example

146
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
example
 

147
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,589
example
that

148
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599

 

149
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,710

you just remove these two and then the

150
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
you just remove these two and then the
 

151
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,869
you just remove these two and then the
first search them will be one nine two

152
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
first search them will be one nine two
 

153
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,390
first search them will be one nine two
right one nine eight right

154
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
right one nine eight right
 

155
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,789
right one nine eight right
and the first search will be one nine

156
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
and the first search will be one nine
 

157
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,509

yeah so that's the case when preferences

164
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
yeah so that's the case when preferences
 

165
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,270
yeah so that's the case when preferences
your definition is the same or a single

sense
 

175
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,149
sense
so today we're going to use the

176
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
so today we're going to use the
 

177
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,990
so today we're going to use the
preferences to solve this problem and

178
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
preferences to solve this problem and
 

179
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,430
preferences to solve this problem and
tomorrow we're going to use the definite

180
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
tomorrow we're going to use the definite
 

181
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,229
tomorrow we're going to use the definite
search to

182
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
search to
 

183
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,670
search to
solve this problem it's okay yeah

184
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
solve this problem it's okay yeah
 

185
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,910

00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
okay so in order to preference what kind
 

187
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,509
okay so in order to preference what kind
of data structure are we using to

188
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
of data structure are we using to
 

189
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,429
of data structure are we using to
implement a buffer search please

190
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
implement a buffer search please
 

191
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,830
implement a buffer search please
practice search no a preference says

192
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
practice search no a preference says
 

193
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,789
practice search no a preference says
what kind of

194
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
what kind of
 

195
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,429
what kind of
data structure can we use data structure

196
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
data structure can we use data structure
 

197
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,309
data structure can we use data structure
i'm talking about

198
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
i'm talking about
 

199
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,789
i'm talking about
q yeah and what's q first thing

which is one all right okay then we take
this one out

222
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
this one out
 

223
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,510
this one out
every time when every time when the q is

224
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
every time when every time when the q is
 

225
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,350
every time when every time when the q is
not empty we take it out and what do we

226
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
not empty we take it out and what do we
 

227
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,110
not empty we take it out and what do we
do next

259
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,510

two two yeah the beginning of the queue

260
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
two two yeah the beginning of the queue
 

261
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,909
two two yeah the beginning of the queue
yeah because the dq is the beginning of

262
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
yeah because the dq is the beginning of
 

263
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,670
yeah because the dq is the beginning of
you like you were waiting in the queue

yeah you're buying something in the
 

267
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,749
yeah you're buying something in the
queue

268

served next right
 

273
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,189
served next right
and when the people coming during the

274
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
and when the people coming during the
 

275
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,350
and when the people coming during the
queue they join

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
queue they join
 

277
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,749
queue they join
at the back of the cube right does it

278
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
at the back of the cube right does it
 

279
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,550
at the back of the cube right does it
make sense oh wait

280
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
make sense oh wait
 

281
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,590
make sense oh wait

abby yeah i take it
out and then three take it out but it

296
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
out and then three take it out but it
 

297
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,870
out and then three take it out but it
doesn't have a kid then

298
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
doesn't have a kid then
 

299
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,430
doesn't have a kid then
then what's your order if that if it

300
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
then what's your order if that if it
 

301
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,430
then what's your order if that if it
doesn't have a kid then i need to

302
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
doesn't have a kid then i need to
 

303
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,510
doesn't have a kid then i need to
sum this value 13 yeah i need to know

304
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
sum this value 13 yeah i need to know
 

305
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,469
sum this value 13 yeah i need to know
that

306
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
that
 

307
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,189
that
the value of 13 yeah and then take the

308
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
the value of 13 yeah and then take the
 

309
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,629
the value of 13 yeah and then take the
4r which is

310
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
4r which is
 

311
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,430
4r which is
the 14 134 yeah 124. that's it

312
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
the 14 134 yeah 124. that's it
 

313
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,150
the 14 134 yeah 124. that's it
so look this is the basic procedure of

314
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
so look this is the basic procedure of
 

315
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,270
so look this is the basic procedure of
preferences but we also need to remember

316
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
preferences but we also need to remember
 

317
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,950
preferences but we also need to remember
the current value from the root to the

318
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
the current value from the root to the
 

319
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,870
the current value from the root to the
from the low to the leaf to the current

320
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
from the low to the leaf to the current
 

321
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,670
from the low to the leaf to the current
now right then how can we do it if we

322
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
now right then how can we do it if we
 

323
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,270
now right then how can we do it if we
look if it's one look alright

324
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
look if it's one look alright
 

325
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,870
look if it's one look alright
look it's one i want to make it

326
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
look it's one i want to make it
 

327
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,990
look it's one i want to make it
alright come on if current load

328
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
alright come on if current load
 

329
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,950
alright come on if current load
is one and then we we have current we if

330
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
is one and then we we have current we if
 

331
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,550
is one and then we we have current we if
the root now is one and

332
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
the root now is one and
 

333
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,469
the root now is one and
we know the next node is two so how can

334
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
we know the next node is two so how can
 

335
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,029
we know the next node is two so how can
we make 12. so i have one i have two how

336
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
we make 12. so i have one i have two how
 

337
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,110
we make 12. so i have one i have two how
can we make 12.

338
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
can we make 12.
 

339
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:10,950
can we make 12.
uh yes

340
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960

 

341
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,070

one and two make one two mathematically

342
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
one and two make one two mathematically
 

343
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,390
one and two make one two mathematically
it's not string you know mathematically

344
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
it's not string you know mathematically
 

345
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,150
it's not string you know mathematically
you put it together

346
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
you put it together
 

347
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,909
you put it together
no and how do you put it together like

348
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
no and how do you put it together like
 

349
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,589
no and how do you put it together like
what 12 and 4 how do you make a 124

350
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
what 12 and 4 how do you make a 124
 

351
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,710
what 12 and 4 how do you make a 124
you're not putting it together

352
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
you're not putting it together
 

353
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,749
you're not putting it together
mathematically there's no operations

354
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
mathematically there's no operations
 

355
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,830
mathematically there's no operations
yeah that's what i'm asking 10 one times

356
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
yeah that's what i'm asking 10 one times
 

357
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,749
yeah that's what i'm asking 10 one times
ten plus two yeah so every time

358
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
ten plus two yeah so every time
 

359
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,230
ten plus two yeah so every time
you want to push in the kit you need to

360
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
you want to push in the kit you need to
 

361
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,990
you want to push in the kit you need to
times current value

362
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
times current value
 

363
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,550
times current value
by ten and add the new value all right

364
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
by ten and add the new value all right
 

365
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,510
by ten and add the new value all right
does it make sense

366
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
does it make sense
 

367
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,950
does it make sense
yeah okay okay let's do this okay prefer

368
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
yeah okay okay let's do this okay prefer

does it make you hungry professors

372
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
does it make you hungry professors

does it make you hungry professors
yes breast first session not breakfast

374
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:51,199
yes breast first session not breakfast
 

375
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,390
yes breast first session not breakfast
okay there's one

376
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
okay there's one
 

377
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,270
okay there's one
preference and we call it root the

378
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
preference and we call it root the
 

379
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,189
preference and we call it root the
beginning the root of the

380
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
beginning the root of the
 

381
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,029
beginning the root of the
tree what's missing color if not we

382
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039
tree what's missing color if not we
 

383
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,309
tree what's missing color if not we
first

384
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
first
 

385
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,070
first
first of all we have to check if the

386
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
first of all we have to check if the
 

387
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,670
first of all we have to check if the
root is empty or all right

388
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
root is empty or all right
 

389
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,830
root is empty or all right
if you lose is num we should return what

390
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
if you lose is num we should return what
 

391
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,749
if you lose is num we should return what
if it's empty tree what what's the sum

392
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
if it's empty tree what what's the sum
 

393
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,510
if it's empty tree what what's the sum
of the mt3 zero

394
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
of the mt3 zero
 

395
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,029
of the mt3 zero
yeah and then in python

396
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
yeah and then in python
 

397
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,869
yeah and then in python
what kind of what we are implementing q

398
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
what kind of what we are implementing q
 

399
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,589
what kind of what we are implementing q
so q

400
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
so q
 

401
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:31,270
so q
equals what what kind of

402
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280

 

403
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,230

and then i need to add what we should

404
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
and then i need to add what we should
 

405
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,670
and then i need to add what we should
know is it

406
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
know is it
 

407
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,269
know is it
weight load this is a set and i need to

408
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
weight load this is a set and i need to
 

409
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,029
weight load this is a set and i need to
i have a tuple yeah load and

410
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
i have a tuple yeah load and
 

411
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,550
i have a tuple yeah load and
lose of value yeah because i need to

412
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
lose of value yeah because i need to
 

413
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,949
lose of value yeah because i need to
remember the value of the current of 200

414
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
remember the value of the current of 200
 

415
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,310
remember the value of the current of 200
roots of the camera

416
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
roots of the camera
 

417
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,190
roots of the camera
this is means that the integer from the

418
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
this is means that the integer from the
 

419
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,750
this is means that the integer from the
root

420
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
root
 

421
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,269
root
to current node okay okay then y

422
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
to current node okay okay then y
 

423
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,470
to current node okay okay then y
you what we need to check if the note

424
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
you what we need to check if the note
 

425
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,550
you what we need to check if the note
if the q is not empty how do we check if

426
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
if the q is not empty how do we check if
 

427
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,630
if the q is not empty how do we check if
the q is empty or not

428
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
the q is empty or not
 

429
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,750
the q is empty or not
why why why q

430
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
why why why q
 

431
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,509
why why why q
is what not

00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
is what not
 

433
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,670
is what not
no zero bigger than zero but q how do we

434
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
no zero bigger than zero but q how do we
 

435
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,710
no zero bigger than zero but q how do we
check

436
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
check
 

437
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,389
check
how do we check the size of q there's

438
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
how do we check the size of q there's
 

439
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,310
how do we check the size of q there's
something missing here length

440
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
something missing here length
 

441
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,230
something missing here length
length yes we are done and now we know

442
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
length yes we are done and now we know
 

443
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,750
length yes we are done and now we know
we need to get the cube

444
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
we need to get the cube
 

445
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,389
we need to get the cube
and how do we kill it how do we get the

446
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
and how do we kill it how do we get the
 

447
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,310
and how do we kill it how do we get the
element from the kill

448
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
element from the kill
 

449
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,670
element from the kill
pop it yeah pop left or pop

450
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
pop it yeah pop left or pop
 

451
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,870
pop it yeah pop left or pop
put left okay now now we need to

452
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
put left okay now now we need to
 

453
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,790
put left okay now now we need to
assign it to current and then value we

454
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
assign it to current and then value we
 

455
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,710
assign it to current and then value we
have radio so because the

456
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720
have radio so because the
 

457
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,949
have radio so because the
each anime in a queue has two elements

458
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:34,959
each anime in a queue has two elements
 

459
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:35,990
each anime in a queue has two elements
right each anime

460
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
right each anime
 

461
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,310
right each anime
and the queue is a tuper with two two

462
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
and the queue is a tuper with two two
 

463
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,190
and the queue is a tuper with two two
values right one is the node one is the

464
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
values right one is the node one is the
 

465
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,070
values right one is the node one is the
one one is the value so look is q dot

466
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
one one is the value so look is q dot
 

467
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,670
one one is the value so look is q dot
problem right

468
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
problem right
 

469
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,790
problem right
right all right okay now we have a

470
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
right all right okay now we have a
 

471
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,509
right all right okay now we have a
current we have a value and

472
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:51,519
current we have a value and
 

473
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,670
current we have a value and
if how do we check if a node is a leaf

474
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
if how do we check if a node is a leaf
 

475
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,910
if how do we check if a node is a leaf
node

476
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
node
 

477
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,990
node
and it doesn't have any

478
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000

 

479
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,069

it doesn't have anyone children

480
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
it doesn't have anyone children
 

481
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,590
it doesn't have anyone children
and how do we check if it doesn't have a

482
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
and how do we check if it doesn't have a
 

483
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,350
and how do we check if it doesn't have a
children if current or left

484
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
children if current or left
 

485
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,949
children if current or left
is what is what if it doesn't have

486
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
is what is what if it doesn't have
 

487
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:11,829
is what is what if it doesn't have
children what what

488
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
children what what
 

489
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,990
children what what
what should we do if current love is

490
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
what should we do if current love is
 

491
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,190
what should we do if current love is
what

492
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
what
 

493
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,790
what

whether even if it's a need to know okay

510
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
whether even if it's a need to know okay
 

511
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,230
whether even if it's a need to know okay
then

512
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
then
 

513
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,110
then
let's edit this answer in the answer

514
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
let's edit this answer in the answer
 

515
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,470
let's edit this answer in the answer
yeah so what should we do now

516
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
yeah so what should we do now
 

517
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,069
yeah so what should we do now
if it's a different now what should we

518
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
if it's a different now what should we
 

519
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,509
if it's a different now what should we
do now

520
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
do now
 

521
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,670
do now
all right if it's a leaf now what should

522
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
all right if it's a leaf now what should
 

523
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,150
all right if it's a leaf now what should
we do

524
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160

 

525
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:03,590

we shall add it editor

526
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600

 

527
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,790

very well done okay then if current

528
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
very well done okay then if current
 

529
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,630
very well done okay then if current
if it has a if it has a left node

530
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
if it has a if it has a left node
 

531
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,230
if it has a if it has a left node
what should we do all right if it if if

532
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
what should we do all right if it if if
 

533
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,829
what should we do all right if it if if
that note has a left node left kick

534
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
that note has a left node left kick
 

535
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,230
that note has a left node left kick
what should we do if it now has a left

536
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
what should we do if it now has a left
 

537
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,509
what should we do if it now has a left
node what should we do

538
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
node what should we do
 

539
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,790
node what should we do
we push it in what

540
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
we push it in what
 

541
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:39,829
we push it in what
kill the what

542
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839

 

543
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,949

what's the value times one this is the

544
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
what's the value times one this is the
 

545
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,230
what's the value times one this is the
value value

546
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
value value
 

547
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,310
value value
and then this is the previous value and

548
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
and then this is the previous value and
 

549
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,509
and then this is the previous value and
then this size can

550
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
then this size can
 

551
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,870
then this size can
add as one column value

552
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
add as one column value
 

553
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,110
add as one column value
current dot left value because we're

554
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
current dot left value because we're
 

555
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,389
current dot left value because we're
talking about the left

556
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
talking about the left
 

557
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,990
talking about the left
okay and if current all right

558
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
okay and if current all right
 

559
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,750
okay and if current all right
what if current on the right what should

560
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
what if current on the right what should
 

561
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,110
what if current on the right what should
we do a comment.right

562
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
we do a comment.right
 

563
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,030
we do a comment.right
q dot append current dot right

564
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
q dot append current dot right
 

565
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,190
q dot append current dot right
uh value times 10 add current

566
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
uh value times 10 add current
 

567
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:19,590
uh value times 10 add current
right wait all right

568
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600

 

569
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,269

yeah and what's missing here

570
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
yeah and what's missing here
 

571
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,629
yeah and what's missing here
well there's something missing in the

572
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:24,639
well there's something missing in the
 

573
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,629
well there's something missing in the
code so what should we do now

574
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639

 

575
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,790

it's very good job what's the time
 

593
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,829
it's very good job what's the time
complexity

594
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
complexity
 

595
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,590
complexity
oh definitely um oh something or

596
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
oh definitely um oh something or
 

597
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,069
oh definitely um oh something or
something

598
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
something
 

599
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,389
something
yeah if there are end nodes in the

600
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
yeah if there are end nodes in the
 

601
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,670
yeah if there are end nodes in the
binary tree

602
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
binary tree
 

603
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,750
binary tree
yeah because we're visiting each node

604
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
yeah because we're visiting each node
 

605
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,430
yeah because we're visiting each node
exactly how many times

606
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
exactly how many times
 

607
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,870
exactly how many times
and we are visiting one time okay what's

608
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
and we are visiting one time okay what's
 

609
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,310
and we are visiting one time okay what's
the space complexity

610
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
the space complexity
 

611
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,710
the space complexity
oh n

612
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720

 

613
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,550

yeah dq yeah because we're using the

614
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
yeah dq yeah because we're using the
 

615
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,230
yeah dq yeah because we're using the
additional space to keep

616
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
additional space to keep
 

617
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,069
additional space to keep
the notes in the yeah we are

618
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
the notes in the yeah we are
 

619
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,790
the notes in the yeah we are
in queueing in kill means push something

620
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
in queueing in kill means push something
 

621
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,870
in queueing in kill means push something
into the kill dq it means take something

622
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
into the kill dq it means take something
 

623
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,470
into the kill dq it means take something
out of the queue okay

624
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
out of the queue okay
 

625
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,310
out of the queue okay
and this is the different operations

626
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
and this is the different operations
 

627
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,710
and this is the different operations
okay let's that's very good that's very
