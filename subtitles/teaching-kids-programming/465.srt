1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,080
hello mr mr rhino right yeah we talked

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,000
about the binary before yeah look this

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,400
is the binary this is the maximum okay

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,960
we we know how to convert the numbers

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,640
from the decimal to the binary and vice

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,960
versa okay so how do we convert the

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960
binary from from the you know from

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,640
numbers from parentheses for example

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,960
like one one one zero in binary what how

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,760
much is this investment

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
what's

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,719
what's this is

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,840
50 this is 15 and what's this

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,520
14 well done wow clever yeah exactly

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,879
yeah so how do we put this 16 easy look

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
you just have to

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,000
you just have to look this this the

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,399
right mouse bit is

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,320
one right this is one

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,160
this is two

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,800
this is four

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,320
this is eight yeah yeah if it's one you

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,640
just add it together yeah eight plus

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,800
four plus two plus one at least if this

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,039
is zero then we just stomach it so it's

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,119
a plus four plus two

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,760
and that's fourteen because this is zero

28
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:13,840
okay yeah one more example 101 1011

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,840
what's this what's this

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,759
eleven one

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,040
two

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,479
this is zero yeah and this is eight a

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,840
plus two plus you know

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:29,040
exactly whatever good job

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,560
how how about 33 in decimal we want to

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,159
convert it to

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,159
binary how do we how we do it

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,960
but the easiest way will be what 32 plus

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,799
one okay what's 32

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
2 to the power of

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,640
whatever 32

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
power of

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,840
5 yeah 2 to the power 5 plus 2 to the

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,240
power of 0 so 2 to the power 5 2 to the

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,880
power of 0 is one

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,200
one two three

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,000
four yeah two to the power five uh okay

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,240
one more digit two to the power five two

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,040
to the power one

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,520
uh

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,840
one two three four five so this is the

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,920
thirty-two okay thirty-two thirty-three

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,599
yeah make sense

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,400
okay

55
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,319
so

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,280
how can we do this in you know the

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:24,400
normal approach normal 33

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,080
divided by two is 16 remained 1 right

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,959
divided by 2

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:34,239
is a remains 0 divided by 2 is 4 remain

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,599
0 divided by 2 equals 2 remains 0

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,800
divided by 2 equals one remain

63
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,920
zero

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,080
divided by two equals zero remains one

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,239
and when we got zero we stopped so the

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,720
binary is this way

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,280
one zero zero zero two one okay four

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,360
zero yeah yeah we talked about like in

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,519
the very early days yeah

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:01,360
okay another example like uh 19 okay 19

71
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,120
converted to finally divided by two nine

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,239
remain one

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:12,959
divided by 2 4 remain 1 divided by 2 2

74
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:17,040
remain 0 divided by 2 1 remain 0 divided

75
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,480
by 2 0 remain 1 so what that was is 1 0

76
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,640
zero one one

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,640
okay let's verify

78
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,080
what's this it's two to the power of one

79
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,959
two three four

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,280
plus

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,400
plus two to the power of one plus two to

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,760
the power of zero so that's three

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,280
yeah and what's this 16 plus 3 equals

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,680
19. got it

85
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,920
yeah sorry coming back to binary the

86
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,159
problem with this is that right look

87
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,159
from three to four

88
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,239
there are three digits changed right one

89
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,080
change to zero one changes to zero zero

90
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,840
to change one right yeah so look uh if

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,439
we want to change from five to six we

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,879
need to change this

93
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,200
to

94
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,239
one digit two digit right

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,159
yeah

96
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,000
so we talk about hamming distance right

97
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,319
hamming distance is state of between two

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,080
numbers it's basically the number of

99
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,760
bits needs to change so the hamming

100
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,400
distance between four and five is

101
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,879
one digit one one digit right so we also

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,479
come up with a coding a great coding

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,519
which is called record you know that

104
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,160
could minimize the number of bit change

105
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,000
between a successive consecutive number

106
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
which is one digit you know we just have

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,120
two ways right

108
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,680
one digit could be

109
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,000
zero one right one digit yeah how about

110
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,639
two digits how about two digits

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,639
uh two bits yeah two bits

112
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,560
look at the normal way the normal way

113
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,680
would be one the normal binary will be

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,280
zero zero zero one one zero

115
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,759
one one why this is binary does it

116
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,680
does this satisfy this

117
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,280
okay from here to here only one bit

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,720
needs to be changed from here to here

119
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,320
now look

120
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,560
here

121
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,479
this is a binary

122
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,160
from one to two how many digits needs to

123
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,520
be changed how many fits needs to be

124
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,919
changed

125
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,720
this is zero one two three from one to

126
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,560
two

127
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,880
how many what's the humming distance

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,560
between two yeah because look glitches

129
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,919
here can you rearrange these four

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,240
numbers so that any two numbers only one

131
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,240
bit needs to be changed zero zero how do

132
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,800
we put it how do we rearrange these

133
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,560
numbers so that the only two even the

134
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,240
first one and the last one right look

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,039
the first one and last one two bits

136
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,039
needs to change

137
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,199
if we swap these two

138
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,639
so look how about we swap these two

139
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,639
so zero zero one zero zero one one one

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,720
doesn't make it better no because zero

141
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,280
zero and one one so how can we do it how

142
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,280
can we do it

143
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,000
do you see the problem right sit down

144
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,000
please

145
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,919
okay so if we solve this two

146
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,120
zero zero

147
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,240
zero one

148
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,240
one one

149
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,800
one zero

150
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,880
perfect let's look one digit change one

151
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,880
digit ten one digit change and even this

152
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,520
one on this one one this chain

153
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,680
yeah great job yeah yeah that's what i'm

154
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,440
saying this is great coding okay

155
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
great

156
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,759
great code

157
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,039
okay the guy whose name is greg designed

158
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,880
this so

159
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,680
the time the purpose of this is to

160
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,600
minimize the digit the bit change

161
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,120
between any two numbers even the first

162
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,400
one and the last one it's for the

163
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,400
electronic circuit yeah design yeah

164
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,400
so the humming distance the harming

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,400
distance between any kung

166
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
consecutive yeah consecutive or

167
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,759
successive what does this mean

168
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,240
successive

169
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
yeah is it the same thing as concept

170
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,280
security

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,840
meaning the two

172
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,440
seconds numbers even the first one the

173
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,759
last one is that

174
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,599
yeah and how about three digits it'll be

175
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,960
harder right but there's one way we're

176
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,039
going to talk about how to do this but

177
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,199
yeah it's slightly different right

178
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,919
different to the binary so look

179
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,840
one bit this is easy yeah only one big

180
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,840
yeah does it have to have four

181
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,160
no no no this this is one piece bits

182
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,759
only one bit okay how about two bits two

183
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,280
bit easy yeah zero one

184
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,880
two bit is this one

185
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,479
zero zero

186
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,560
zero one one

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,520
one one zero so how do we do this how

188
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,880
can we get it from one bit to two bits

189
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,720
easy look

190
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,759
so first of all

191
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,199
first of all

192
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,240
this is the magic

193
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,960
line

194
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,520
magic okay so how do you do this look

195
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,240
first of all we just copy these yeah but

196
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,440
reverse these things so here put it here

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,680
zero put it here one okay

198
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,039
yeah and then

199
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,879
i know what do we do

200
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,800
and then we just put a

201
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:51,599
zero zero here and then one one here

202
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,680
okay so let's become zero zero zero one

203
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,520
one zero one one okay

204
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,800
how about okay another third three

205
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,919
first of all we take this here yeah copy

206
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,240
here

207
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,800
and now we copy this bit put it here but

208
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,080
in the reverse order so it's one one

209
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,879
one zero zero one zero zero

210
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,639
okay

211
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,879
and then what do we do

212
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,280
this is the copy period this is a new

213
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,759
bit so we put zero zero zero zero and

214
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,319
then one one one one can you can we

215
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,080
double check

216
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,759
only one digit change

217
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,840
everyone did the chat

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,759
yeah one digit

219
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,000
okay okay sorry so

220
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,640
so that's a mistake here all right okay

221
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,279
change here to one zero okay

222
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,360
all right yeah so let's redo this okay

223
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,399
there was a mistake

224
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,160
that's a mistake

225
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,160
zero zero zero one one one one zero okay

226
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,360
then we copy this in the reverse order

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,519
so one zero one one zero one zero zero

228
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,720
and then we put

229
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,720
the first bill is the other one

230
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,680
oh yeah yeah that's why we got a mistake

231
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,600
okay ldl one one one one okay let's

232
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,360
double check

233
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,640
one one digit

234
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,080
one digit

235
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,279
one digit

236
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,480
and here

237
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,480
one digit this digit and here this digit

238
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,880
and this one this digit

239
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,040
and then this one this digit and even

240
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,640
this dip and then this one

241
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,839
one digit yeah

242
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,480
makes sense

243
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,800
so this one zero zero uh okay so this

244
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,920
one should be

245
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,080
one

246
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,040
and then this one zero okay

247
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,040
yeah

248
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,440
so look how do we solve this problem

249
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,560
look what did i just do

250
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,360
so

251
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,120
so you yes i do this in like mirror yeah

252
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,640
and then just do

253
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,920
my old ones zeros and then

254
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,560
okay so

255
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,519
this is the this is the base cases base

256
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,600
cases if we have one n equal equal one

257
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,720
then we know we need to return zero and

258
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,880
one right this is the base case

259
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,000
for a greater n

260
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,720
for the greater end we just do the n

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,040
minus k cases yeah f n we want to solve

262
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,040
the f now we just need to take

263
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,720
first of all take a

264
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,000
f a

265
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,800
a equals f n minus one cases

266
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,760
f

267
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,600
f equals a equals f and minus k 6 is

268
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,800
this one and then we need to reverse

269
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,839
this bit

270
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,640
reverse this bit okay

271
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,800
and then we need to put the first uh put

272
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,000
the one this one

273
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,600
is equals to two to the power of

274
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,920
how many digits

275
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,560
it's actually one shift n minus one

276
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,600
places yeah 50 and minus one

277
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,000
so this bit and i will put this number

278
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,040
in front of all the numbers

279
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,200
of a

280
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,160
i know we get it yeah

281
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,160
makes sense yeah

282
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,839
there are actually many ways to do this

283
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,000
grey coding but i i think this this is

284
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,440
one of the most easy to understand uh

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,720
straightforward way right so so i mean

286
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,200
you can also do using this backtracking

287
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
to do it

288
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,120
let's do this look define

289
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,320
and that's great gray coating gray

290
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
and

291
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,000
if

292
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,560
n equal one okay and this is the number

293
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,360
of bits yeah if n equals one we just

294
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,399
return the base case is zero and one

295
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,360
right

296
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,519
this is the face cases now what do we do

297
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,440
okay let me just write this at zero one

298
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,600
okay and then we what do we do we just

299
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,160
take this zero one and then we reverse

300
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,040
it put it here and put it here one zero

301
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,800
yeah so this bit yeah

302
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,200
this bit and then we put a zero zero at

303
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,519
the beginning one one okay yeah you

304
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
missed something what wasn't it you

305
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,120
missed cash

306
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,959
not yet no yeah we've talked about that

307
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,120
probably we don't need a cash but good

308
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,440
good point yeah if you if we are going

309
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,200
to use this function a lot many many

310
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,279
times then that's a good idea to put a

311
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,360
cash to remember the values we have

312
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,519
calculated yeah okay let's do that again

313
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,519
so

314
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,000
this is this is n right this is n cases

315
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,800
this is m n minus one

316
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,480
so first of all we take we first of all

317
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,200
we take a previous one previous one

318
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,360
equals gray

319
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,279
n minus one right so this previous one

320
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,279
would be zero one right

321
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,040
right all right but now we need to find

322
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,600
out what what's this value what's this

323
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,760
one what does it equal in binary it

324
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,480
equals how many digits of that that will

325
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,160
be n minus one digit yeah so it's

326
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,880
actually this k

327
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,720
this this k let's let's name it k k will

328
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,839
be equals one shifted shifty and minus

329
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,360
one yeah yeah so if what does it mean it

330
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,279
means one

331
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,959
followed by

332
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,040
how many zeros

333
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,360
and minus one zeros but this is in

334
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,200
binary okay come on this is in binary

335
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,680
what what does this mean k

336
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,079
one shift is shifted n minus one is

337
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,200
basically meaning that okay one here

338
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,160
shit one

339
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,079
shifty one shift is 51

340
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,000
means okay i shift one position to the

341
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,680
left so that'll be one zero i shift for

342
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,760
another position to the left that will

343
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,040
be one zero zero right it's basically

344
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,720
like the same as two to the power of 2

345
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,639
1 2.

346
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,360
one shift is shifted

347
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,760
2 is 1 0 0

348
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,920
in binary so basically this is the same

349
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,279
as 2 to the power of

350
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,760
2 okay

351
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,079
okay this is k so now we want to put the

352
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,399
k this is the value in front of the

353
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,040
reverse one right so we first we need to

354
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,440
return what we turn

355
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,839
right we turn that this bit yeah but in

356
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,000
indicate this is still exam we put a

357
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,760
zero in front of the values it doesn't

358
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,279
make it make a change it doesn't change

359
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,920
it right all right

360
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,920
this value look zero zero zero one is

361
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,000
the same as zero one right if we put a

362
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,240
zero in front of a number

363
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,079
it doesn't change this value right even

364
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,839
in decimal right

365
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,519
a hundred you put a zero in the front it

366
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,760
doesn't change the 100 but it's still

367
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,160
equals to 100 i'm right

368
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,360
yeah so return previous we still need

369
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,480
that result the previous is listed

370
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,480
plus but we want to pass this video

371
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,959
yeah we're going to plus this fix now k

372
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,600
we need to put a pen this k to all the

373
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,040
numbers in front right

374
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,199
plus what

375
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,279
k plus x

376
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,040
yeah for

377
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,920
x in

378
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,079
in

379
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,079
this previous but in previous we have to

380
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,040
reverse it how do we reverse it how do

381
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,040
we reverse the list

382
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,199
minus one column column minus one yeah

383
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,360
okay i like it look

384
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,800
now okay and why don't you put the

385
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,880
mention a very

386
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,320
important point cash

387
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,639
just to remember the values yeah

388
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,240
this is just to say that uh

389
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,279
if going to we run this many many times

390
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,760
better to memorize it right memorize it

391
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,000
what's the harming distance between any

392
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,079
two digits like zero zero one yeah

393
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,320
exactly because only one digit change

394
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,600
and we're going to talk about a genetic

395
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,680
genetic aggregator yeah genetics

396
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,639
what does this word mean genetic

397
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,560
mutated genetic pokemon genetics what

398
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,519
does it mean it's in biology right yeah

399
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
genetic

400
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,240
look

401
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,839
like you're not another parent yes mommy

402
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,279
and daddy yeah

403
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,079
mom and daddy

404
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,920
you are the offspring of mommy and daddy

405
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,160
offspring

406
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,160
yeah

407
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,759
yeah but you too

408
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,920
get some

409
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,759
genes for mommy and daddy but with some

410
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,000
mutation right

411
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,440
yeah so we're going to apply this kind

412
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,680
of biology

413
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,560
you know knowledge into ignorance so

414
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,519
basically we have a few parents parents

415
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,720
and then parents do this crossover

416
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,720
cross over

417
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,240
with the gin cross over

418
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,519
and then we we you ryan yeah you get

419
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,040
something

420
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,480
from mommy and daddy everybody you get

421
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,480
something from mom and daddy but

422
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,240
slightly you're different right let's

423
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,480
call the mutation

424
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,199
let's mutate i'll get a pokemon flashy

425
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,199
what's the mutation

426
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,519
what's immunity

427
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,480
i don't know

428
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,680
immutable mutable what's mutable can't

429
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,639
change yeah mutation is that your gene

430
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,399
is

431
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,800
for example you maybe you can change

432
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,639
yeah yeah for example you get maybe i

433
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,000
don't know eighty percent of genes for

434
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,600
mommy and daddy and with two twenty

435
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,040
percent slightly different that's a

436
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,759
mutation

437
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,079
yeah so that's very useful this quaker

438
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,680
is very useful in muta in a genetic

439
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,360
argument why is that because

440
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,040
because with the mutation it's just

441
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,279
slightly different right slightly

442
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,759
different so we can use this to apply

443
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,759
the mutation because look

444
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,800
the grey curve the next

445
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,079
the next number in the grey curve series

446
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,399
only slightly differs only one bit right

447
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,039
only one bit so for each bit we can

448
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,360
consider it as a gene so let's look at

449
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,679
mixed number zero zero one and zero zero

450
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,760
and zero two one we can consider it as a

451
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,480
gene right for example this one

452
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,520
maybe can be represented as the color of

453
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,280
the hair

454
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,280
you know the the intelligence yeah

455
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,280
i don't know how tall you are right so

456
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,559
each num each bit could be

457
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,520
a gene determine something and then we

458
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,360
this uh mutation we can with a grey

459
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,559
curve because when the breaker

460
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,240
determines that we can use the quaker to

461
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,720
to

462
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,200
to go up to to mutate the gene right

463
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,039
okay so this is a very interesting topic

464
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,559
maybe we can talk about

465
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,400
you know in the future

466
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,760
okay so to sum up this is kind of the

467
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,640
mirror way

468
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,559
we take m minus one yeah we take n minus

469
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,480
one greater

470
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,559
yeah the base case is still one right we

471
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,960
know how to solve the base case zero one

472
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,640
with the logarithm or we take it

473
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,400
whatever we have

474
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,400
and we put it

475
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,039
we will put it in the reverse and we'll

476
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,960
put it one in the front okay so

477
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,720
let's do the

478
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,160
number three again okay let's do the

479
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,679
number

480
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,000
okay okay

481
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,600
let's do take these one more example

482
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,840
okay so look zero zero zero one one one

483
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,160
one zero and then we take

484
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,039
take whatever we have and then reverse

485
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,640
the order so that's one zero one one

486
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:34,480
zero one zero zero and we'll put a zero

487
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,960
zero and one one in the front okay so

488
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,600
that will be one digit change

489
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,520
one digit change

490
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,400
one digit

491
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,000
i wanted to change

492
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,320
okay i wanted to change one digit

493
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,640
here one digit change

494
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,919
yeah one digit okay i'm going to

495
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,120
mark

496
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,200
these please this only one did you

497
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,960
change

498
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,720
from zlj1 to 011 is this did you change

499
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,919
yeah is it

500
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,000
yeah

501
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:13,000
okay that's it for today bye bye bye bye

502
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
bye
