1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:07,120
hello mr mr ryan how are you today

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,040
okay so you know how to multiply two

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,400
numbers yeah yeah

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,920
okay okay one two three four five six

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,080
how do you do it

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:22,400
okay okay how do we do it

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,560
one two we do this number times yeah

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,480
this number times this and then this

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,400
number times this and we put it in like

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,400
one and then okay number here

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,079
oh you're so lazy just give me how to

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,079
you know just teach me how to do it but

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,680
without giving me the example okay but i

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,160
understand what you mean yeah these

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,000
numbers are eight yeah

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,440
and then

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
seventy

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,520
three right and i please

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,680
hear something something and i i learned

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,039
together right you're lazy yeah yeah

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,039
yeah yeah you're lazy

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,440
okay so in python actually if we give

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,799
given two string and then these could be

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,520
you know very

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,520
huge abstract length right so you can

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,520
just directly if these are given two

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,040
strings and then you can just do you

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,119
know convert it to you can use this in a

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,240
and then convert the string to integer

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,040
times

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,840
in

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,520
b you know right and then you can

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,799
convert the result back to the string

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,439
right

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,439
yeah this would be it but we want to

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,360
understand how do we

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,439
let the computer do the math

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,000
do the multiplication because in some

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,240
other language right not in person like

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
in java in the

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,880
the integer

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,920
has a fixed size so you cannot store

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,280
you know for example in c c or in in c

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,439
plus plus

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,680
another problem in language and if you

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,479
declare in right

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,840
yeah if you declare the in integer a

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,560
right it can only store

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,399
stop a number which is four bytes so

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,479
this is for byte right

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,960
okay this is the highest sign but if

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,640
we're talking about you unsigned

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,720
individual which means that none

54
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,640
negative it will be a will be belongs to

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,080
you know 0

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,720
and 2 to 2 to the power of 32

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,920
to -1 right because it's 32-bit so this

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,520
is the maximum number that unsigned okay

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,520
and then

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,720
and signed

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,120
four by integer four by integer

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,120
yeah remember

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,480
what's by

64
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,879
32 bit yeah four by 32 bits yeah

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,400
right okay

66
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,800
computer

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,640
let's review this data uh

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,400
data unit right

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,040
what speed

70
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,480
a bit is a bit it is

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,920
a picture thing

72
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,360
yeah yeah well there are only two

73
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,200
possibilities

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,239
zero and one

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,840
okay so it's zero all one right let's

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,239
pick

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,280
and next one is byte the computer stores

78
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,120
the unit the basically uh storing data

79
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,800
units spiked

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,920
is eight bit

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,400
yeah

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,680
a bit what's a bit

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,360
it's like

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,720
so you have a b like zero

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,599
so that's binary okay so how what if if

86
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,080
this one one one one what's this

87
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,799
remember this binary what's this oh i'm

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,760
buying that

89
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,040
two

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,440
one plus two plus four plus eight right

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,400
that's one fifteen right and then one

92
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,400
one one one one one one one maximum is

93
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,959
one three i don't know

94
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,720
one plus two one plus two

95
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,440
plus 4 plus a plus 16 plus 32 plus 64

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,959
plus 128. so if you put all the nodes

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,239
together it's 255 okay so 8 by 8 bit a

98
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,680
byte is from 0 to 100 to 25 okay

99
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,680
similarly

100
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,000
what's what's the next one

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,239
kb kit bike

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,680
killer bike yeah it's a 10 24.

103
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,760
yeah look 10

104
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,760
24 bytes why is it 10 24 because 10 24

105
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,759
is 2 to the power of

106
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,280
1 10 right

107
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
yeah

108
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,360
okay

109
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,120
and what's next unit

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,639
10 24 kilobyte would be megabyte

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,759
10 24

112
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,120
kilobytes

113
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,800
what's next

114
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,320
what's next

115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,919
gigabyte

116
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,600
what does that equal

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:43,080
what is equal that equals um 10 24 can

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,080
you guess 1024

119
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,450
[Music]

120
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
okay

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,759
integer is 32 bit so it

122
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,240
it represents the number from 0 to 232

123
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,560
to the power 32 minus 1 right so this is

124
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,360
a very big number but still not very

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,560
big enough right

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,160
so

127
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,680
um so

128
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,360
we have to know that how we do it uh

129
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
you know how how are we helping the

130
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,720
computers to do the math so one easy way

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,080
would be what

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,360
let's do this example again

133
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,160
okay so if if there are

134
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,320
three this is that a is three three

135
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,479
digit b is three digits so what's the

136
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,960
result what's the maximum

137
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,560
result what's the length of that result

138
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,160
how many digits of the a times b

139
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,440
how many digits

140
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,000
if if this is n this is m how many

141
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,039
maximum i mean how many digits

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,960
four

143
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,400
no wait no no

144
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,080
let me do the

145
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,800
how many digits i mean just the maximum

146
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,960
it looks like it might be a three digit

147
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,880
three digit yeah if it times one it'll

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,840
be four of three digits but if it times

149
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,880
this one

150
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,080
will be oh four digits

151
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,319
three five digits it's five six oaa okay

152
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,440
five six away

153
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,880
so what i'm saying is that if a

154
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,840
is n digit

155
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,319
b is mdg what's the maximum

156
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,520
of the result you can guess for example

157
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,360
like nine

158
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,520
yeah that's what i'm saying okay you

159
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,319
times these together

160
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,960
well

161
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,000
999 times 99

162
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,919
equals

163
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,680
998001 alright so six digits okay let's

164
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,840
try another example this is the maximum

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,919
you can get there so what what do it

166
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,840
what's that nine nine nine four digit

167
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,440
times three digit what's the maximum

168
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,880
digit

169
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,599
is is

170
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,160
this one is nine nine eight

171
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,800
zero one so seven digit okay so if you

172
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,440
like n digits of a mdg dot b so they're

173
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,720
term together the maximum is n plus and

174
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,280
digit right

175
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,639
yeah makes sense yeah the maximum is

176
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,560
nine right you can you can't put more

177
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,360
than nine right yeah

178
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,280
okay

179
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,599
so if we have this result then let's

180
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,919
start this without an answer answer all

181
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,160
right my answer will be the digit yeah

182
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,199
every every time you have a zero zero

183
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,280
zero at the beginning is zero

184
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,840
so if if i say

185
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,360
if i say i want to translate and times

186
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,919
this where do you

187
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,479
what does it put okay if we do this this

188
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,599
is from here to from right to the left

189
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,080
this is index zero this is index one so

190
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,240
if the index i

191
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,400
in index i

192
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,720
times index j

193
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,879
so where are we going to put

194
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,199
so two times six where where is it going

195
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,199
to be

196
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,000
where it's going to be

197
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,319
it's gonna be

198
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,879
so is it going to be i plus j right if

199
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,080
you look yeah all right

200
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,400
yeah

201
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,599
okay look let's try this again okay

202
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,879
let's try this again look what two six

203
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,400
times six times two is this is six is

204
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,240
twenty right this is twenty so it

205
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,800
actually is one twenty

206
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,240
right one twenty so we're going to put

207
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,720
twelve we want to put 12 where

208
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,360
we're going to put the 12 is i plus j

209
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,440
right look because because this j equals

210
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,039
zero yeah we're looking from the right

211
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,560
or left one

212
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,519
uh i equals one right zero one

213
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,080
so

214
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,320
one plus zero is one so we're going to

215
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,640
put this 120

216
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,440
at starting at a position

217
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,519
one right i plus three

218
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,560
right so if we're going to do this if

219
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,519
we're going to

220
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,080
if we're going to multiply each digit

221
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,399
yeah from each number and then we can

222
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,640
put it in corresponding

223
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,760
position right

224
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,360
yeah

225
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,560
now we can do this right

226
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,160
this is the way to do the uh

227
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,320
okay

228
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,880
okay so look all right

229
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
these numbers are they are represent

230
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,640
from the

231
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,880
most uh significant to the least

232
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,600
significant from the left what we call

233
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,839
the left side is the most significant

234
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,760
and and the right move side is least

235
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,760
significant right

236
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,680
so if if we can reverse the digit right

237
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,880
then we can do it in

238
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,240
using the index yeah why are we going to

239
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,000
do this so we make it simpler right

240
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
if we reverse the a that would be three

241
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,920
to one right look

242
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,920
but it's actually one two three if we do

243
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
by the way how do we reverse this if a i

244
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
want to make it reverse how do we

245
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,760
reverse it yes

246
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,480
how do you reverse it

247
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,560
2.0 yeah we can do foreign use the quick

248
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,200
one which is what

249
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,200
minus one test uh column

250
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,600
four four five six okay let's let's do

251
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,839
the reverse thing that'll be six five

252
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,000
four so yeah actually okay so this is

253
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,560
representing a this is b this is b

254
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,959
this is our way okay and this array is

255
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,360
three represents the number the universe

256
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,120
order is one two three times

257
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,399
four five six and then we have a result

258
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
your answer

259
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,680
at the beginning we have uh how many

260
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,120
digits

261
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,680
there are three digits there are three

262
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,320
digits the most will be the sixth digit

263
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,920
so i put a six yellow here

264
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,360
okay

265
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,320
okay so now

266
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,040
if i go from here the i digit

267
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,760
yeah that's three three i equals three i

268
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,360
equals zero i i equals zero for this one

269
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,920
and j equals

270
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,120
let's just start from here j for and

271
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,480
call this

272
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,680
three times six eighteen right

273
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,600
yeah

274
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,880
i equals zero j equals zero so the

275
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,079
result will be put in i plus j right

276
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,320
okay

277
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,200
so it's zero so eighteen look but it's

278
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,880
eighteen yeah we don't we ideally we

279
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,920
want to store only one digit in one

280
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,959
place right so 18 let's put it 18 and

281
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,360
here right because this is 18 right but

282
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,760
now we need to do what we need to spread

283
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,600
yeah we need to carry over 18 carry over

284
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,839
to this

285
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,480
so what what does it become all right

286
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,959
this is 18. even digit is 18 i don't

287
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,959
want to start more than 10 here then you

288
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,079
need to go

289
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,079
yeah so what does it become

290
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,519
yeah that's what i mean yeah so look

291
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,160
let's try another example three times

292
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:58,959
five here so where are we going to put

293
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,440
so let's put this a here okay one here

294
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,800
okay so we're going to put the 15 right

295
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,800
yes and the result will be in

296
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,160
in three i plus j so you'll be here

297
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,880
right

298
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,320
15 plus one is 16 right

299
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,320
yeah

300
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,360
but i need to carry over so what's that

301
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,240
um

302
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,160
six one yes six one you see

303
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,320
so if we're doing this

304
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,079
i and doing with j we keep going and

305
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,880
then we can get this result and we just

306
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,720
can after all we can just what reverse

307
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,279
this answer

308
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,279
yeah make sense

309
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,360
okay let's write it to you i think you

310
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,000
understand okay can you tell me the most

311
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,519
important takeaway is what if the digit

312
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,959
from i

313
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,360
a i l a i times b j

314
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,639
we're going to put the answer

315
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,639
where you're going to put the answer

316
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,240
we need to carry over to i plus j plus

317
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,360
one right because we don't want to store

318
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,680
a two digit or three digits we don't

319
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,920
want we only want to store one digit

320
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,440
yeah and we won't carry over

321
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,200
to the next one and

322
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,200
we can reverse it

323
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,279
yeah

324
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,680
okay for simplicity we don't consider

325
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,920
the negative numbers yeah so the numbers

326
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,000
a and b does not contain the negative

327
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,079
the minus sign right yeah but you can

328
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,519
handle it if if

329
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,880
two negatives

330
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,240
multiplied together they will be

331
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,320
positive yeah

332
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,399
if one of them is negative the result

333
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,079
will be one what

334
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,200
negative negative yeah exactly so we

335
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,440
don't have the

336
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,240
in for the simplicity we don't have the

337
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,399
uh

338
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,959
you know the a and b with the negative

339
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,839
number okay define

340
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,000
multiply

341
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,480
b okay

342
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,680
a b okay

343
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,680
and then look

344
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,000
and m equals length a

345
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,920
length b right and now we want to store

346
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,079
the answer in answer equal and the

347
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,320
beginning will be zero times one how

348
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,440
many digits the answer will be how many

349
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,600
digits

350
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
we just talk about how many digits it

351
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,160
will be

352
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,160
i

353
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,160
am

354
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,959
okay now we just need to reverse first

355
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,480
of all we need to reverse this a and b

356
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,240
right right

357
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,839
a equals a

358
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,360
plus dash current minus one b equals

359
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,120
b yeah this is the simple way python

360
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,199
right yeah otherwise you have to

361
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,680
implement a two-pointer thing to swap

362
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,600
yeah at two points

363
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,959
and then now we just need to go through

364
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,920
for i

365
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,240
in

366
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,079
range

367
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,279
n right

368
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,160
then

369
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,120
for

370
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,079
j

371
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,600
in

372
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,600
rent

373
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,399
okay by looking at these two number two

374
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,399
fours what's the time complexity

375
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:09,120
because these two are nested for loop

376
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,519
for each n for each eye you need to do j

377
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,600
times right so that's item straight so

378
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,160
it's 10 times

379
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,399
length for the two right for the two

380
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,160
numbers

381
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,600
by the way the a and b are given as a

382
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,079
stringer if you

383
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,079
one two three and then p will be four

384
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,480
five six

385
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,320
you need to give me a string str right

386
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,440
give me a string

387
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,000
now look

388
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,279
now i answer

389
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:43,120
i plus j right equals and i want to

390
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:46,240
times n a i times bi right so ai is the

391
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,920
ai is a string right it's a character

392
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,639
yeah we want to convert it how can we

393
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,440
convert this one to one

394
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,399
easy question this is string this is

395
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,199
integer how can we do this

396
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,920
one way is to leave in yeah

397
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,720
or remember the old function

398
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,040
odd one what does it give us

399
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,360
what does it give us

400
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,480
all the zero

401
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,720
all the zero give us 48 right so all the

402
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,240
y you just need to minus

403
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,600
40 a and that's another same thing

404
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,959
so here let's just do this a i

405
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,079
let's let's let's just do alt

406
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,560
a i

407
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,440
minus 40 a and then we need to times

408
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,279
what

409
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,199
times over d

410
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,880
a j

411
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,120
minus 40 a okay so

412
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,360
we but remember we need to carry over

413
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,959
right carry over

414
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,920
yeah so we pass

415
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,079
sorry

416
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,000
so actually this is not equal it's plus

417
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,480
equal right because the multiplier is

418
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,120
plus equals

419
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,360
and then answer

420
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,680
i plus j

421
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,199
plus one right plus one

422
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,360
plus one will be what

423
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,039
will be one so the next digit will be

424
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,039
the previous digit

425
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,480
plus equal previous this is the answer

426
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,959
i plus j

427
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,679
divided by 10 right carry over and then

428
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,480
we need to carry over the next one look

429
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,760
this 18 right 18 we want to carry over

430
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,600
to one and

431
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,679
to a and one right

432
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,400
so that's two steps first step is this

433
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,120
digit the i plus one plus j plus one

434
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,600
needs to carry over plus equal leasing

435
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,360
divided by ten and the second second

436
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,200
step is to do this 18 and do the modulus

437
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,960
so i plus j

438
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,200
modulus what

439
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
10.

440
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,480
yeah

441
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,320
what did i just say 18.

442
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,080
two steps first one is two one to carry

443
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,480
the one over to the next digit the

444
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,360
second step is make 18 a right by

445
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,760
modulus 10 right yeah so this can

446
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,039
carry over to a1 okay

447
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,080
now answer will return the number

448
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,799
okay

449
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,720
a number of number of these yeah so we

450
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,880
want to remove the

451
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,120
we remove the

452
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,360
[Music]

453
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,320
the leading zeros right

454
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,840
we all know that zeros okay

455
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,720
so first of all

456
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,200
if i do this dot join

457
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,679
john answer yeah my answer is uh array

458
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,440
of uh digits we want to make this answer

459
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,520
a array of

460
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,160
array of what array of

461
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,320
characters so what do we do

462
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,320
wait

463
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,200
okay so

464
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,200
array of

465
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,960
so this is this is array of uh digits

466
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,160
right array of digits

467
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,840
one for example the result is read as

468
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,480
210 right yes 210. well we want to join

469
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,160
that we want to join that

470
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,760
numbers together so how do we join the

471
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,679
numbers together

472
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,799
these days

473
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,280
remember we want first of all we want to

474
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,320
make it work make it this one

475
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,039
so first of all we want to make it this

476
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,120
yeah how to how to become how to convert

477
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,760
from a to here

478
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,600
yeah but this is the array

479
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,360
before that we need to do this map

480
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,880
maxing map

481
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,400
to star

482
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,120
the first one is the function and the

483
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,919
second one is the list which is a yeah

484
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,120
yeah so i met please and then i can join

485
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,600
it right

486
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,520
yeah and then join

487
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,640
but before i met him i need to reverse

488
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,400
it right reverse it look

489
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,039
reverse it first of all reverse it

490
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,720
convert it each one to the string and

491
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,640
join it right

492
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,799
if i tune it and i i will have something

493
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,559
like zero zero zero one two three i want

494
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:55,120
to remove this leading zero right yeah

495
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,280
yeah i want to remove this leading zeros

496
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,520
so we can use two functions to do one

497
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,760
function which is called

498
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,280
airstrip

499
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,280
by default air strip is stripping left

500
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,159
and by default if you don't give any

501
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,400
parameters you strip the white space

502
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,440
right the space white space

503
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,559
yeah

504
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,919
so look

505
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,039
look

506
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,880
anything here i put every

507
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,120
okay anyway here

508
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,280
there's a lot of space and i can say

509
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,080
airstrike

510
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,559
you you'll give me you remove anything

511
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,440
in front you'll give me one array

512
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,159
all right

513
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,799
and a lot of space will be after because

514
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,440
we don't remove it yet and we can call

515
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:42,240
another one called r strip

516
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,440
this is to remove the space white space

517
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,799
at the end so you'll become eric

518
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,480
okay

519
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,520
and then if you want to do both you can

520
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,520
just do call one string

521
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,440
and a parameter you can give a parameter

522
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,159
to it so for example if i give a

523
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,000
parameter to it so you will only

524
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,400
retrieve

525
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,240
what you will only remove the zeros

526
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,760
leading zero on the left side

527
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,679
so this one

528
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,120
i can remove this

529
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,120
dust air strip yeah

530
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,799
yeah

531
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,159
and then

532
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,159
look if if the result is zero times zero

533
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,159
what's what's the outcome of zero times

534
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,000
zero

535
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,080
it will be all zero and if i do the l

536
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,679
strip it'll be nothing so i have this is

537
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,679
the special case i have to check if it's

538
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,000
nothing then i'll return zero right

539
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,080
otherwise return x

540
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,559
makes sense

541
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,320
make sense everyone

542
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,840
yeah okay so what's the important thing

543
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,840
you learned today

544
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,840
come on give me one second

545
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,840
how

546
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,640
so

547
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,640
a i

548
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,799
times b j

549
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,280
okay first of all we reverse it and a i

550
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,280
times d where are we going to put answer

551
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,640
with your friends

552
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,559
put it in one

553
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,440
a i plus

554
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,600
j okay and then we need to carry over to

555
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,200
the next digit

556
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,880
okay

557
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,280
okay make sense

558
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,919
look we are reversing the actually this

559
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,240
is answer not the result okay and answer

560
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,400
we're reversing the result realize that

561
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,360
result is the list of

562
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,840
digits

563
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,679
it's an integer and now we convert it

564
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,039
using the map convert it to

565
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,159
list of

566
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,799
string

567
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,720
when it's list of string i can join it i

568
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,320
can join as a string and then i want to

569
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,559
remove the

570
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,799
leading zero okay and i want to check if

571
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,640
it's after removing the leading zero if

572
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,039
it is empty it means the result is

573
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,280
yellow right otherwise we return this

574
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,760
right

575
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,760
make sense

576
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,720
yeah make sense

577
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,120
happy

578
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,160
okay you can say bye bye bye

579
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,190
bye bye

580
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,190
