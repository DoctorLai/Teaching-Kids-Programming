1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,839
okay so what happened yesterday what did

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,400
we talk about yesterday remember

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,880
multiple conflicts yeah

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,000
so like we have two coins yeah the first

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,840
one has 50 percent facing up and then

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,039
the second

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,760
second coin has the like 20 facing up

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,840
so

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,840
if we want to have two coins facing out

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,640
what's the probability

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,279
what's the probability

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,600
the first one have 50 50

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,920
you know the second coin has 20 facing

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,399
up how what's the probability of two

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
coins both facing up

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,050
um

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,879
everywhere

18
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,800
[Music]

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,920
the first coin has twenty percent point

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,760
three

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,200
the first coin has fifty percent facing

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,320
out the first second coin is twenty

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,000
percent

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,960
ten percent yeah yeah okay

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,559
okay so

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,000
we use the dynamic programming look at

27
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,480
this is right dfsi k here we can let it

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
represent that we are

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,720
we are now

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,119
freaking with ice coin and then we have

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,680
k coins remaining

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,560
take heads remaining okay the balance

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,600
okay

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,280
all right

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,200
obviously when i

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,680
when we're running out of coins we just

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,840
need to check if the balance is zero if

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,439
his balance is zero then

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
that's probability one otherwise

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,240
probability is zero okay

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,720
but facing up we can let the current

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,400
coin facing up then we have k minus

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,759
coins yeah

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
left

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,240
if we let the

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,920
common cone facing down we have

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,320
still got the

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,640
balance 10 right this hasn't changed

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,000
but in both cases we have to move to the

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,280
next card

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,360
right

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,079
moving to the

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,880
moving to the next cone when the coin

54
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,680
common coin has their probability facing

55
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,200
up is p i right this is given and the

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,680
probability of it facing down is 1 minus

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,680
p i right yeah because both events added

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,759
up to 1.

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,520
okay so this is dfs we use the

60
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,200
top down dynamic programming with the

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,560
cash with the cash

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,060
if we don't put the cash what's the time

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,200
complexity

64
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,720
[Music]

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,440
if we don't put a cash remember

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,560
sorry

67
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,720
if i put a cache is oh i times o n times

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,519
k now if i don't put the cache what's

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,959
the time zone velocity

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,480
what's the time complexity i don't

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,760
remember the values remember

72
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,879
okay

73
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,800
oh two and right now what what

74
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,480
two to the power one why why is that

75
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,640
because for each coin

76
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,959
we have two choice yeah each coin we

77
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,760
have two choice so it's basically the

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,840
same as picking the

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,959
you know finding the subsequence and

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,840
finding the subsequence of what

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,720
yeah

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,720
in

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,959
the number of subsequent right remember

84
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,959
i was subsequent

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,800
a b c how many subsequents are there

86
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,040
a b c okay

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
if empty is also subsequent but how many

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,040
subsequent for abc

89
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,879
seven yeah including the subsequence

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,080
empty you'll be a so look

91
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,360
a b

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,360
a c right so for this look for this a

93
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,120
you have two choice for this b you have

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,920
two choices for let me see you have two

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,200
choices two times two times two a okay

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,159
so each one we have uh two choice so if

97
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,480
there are n

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,519
right if we look if we want to have at

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,440
least k

100
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
so it's actually two to the power of k

101
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,599
okay because

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,200
yeah we want to find the subsequent

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,959
subsequent with k hat facing up right so

104
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,280
2 to the power of k but we use the top

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,640
down diameter with the cash

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,120
so with the cash i remember the values

107
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,640
so i don't call i don't calculate it

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,159
over and over again right because i

109
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,760
remember i asked the computer to

110
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,480
remember you use the cash right the

111
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,280
computer will will remember once it

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,519
knows this value d p d f s i k okay make

113
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,519
sense

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,959
the bottom of dynamic programming yeah

115
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,560
in other way we we remember the values

116
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,560
in in a

117
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,360
two-dimensional way right in our way and

118
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,919
then we store the values once we have it

119
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
right and we calculate the base cases

120
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,120
from

121
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,400
dfs

122
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,800
what dfs zero the base cases and then we

123
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,479
use the values to

124
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,199
calculate the the i and k yeah

125
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,759
dfs int with the larger value right make

126
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,600
sense it's like fibonacci number yeah

127
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,280
fibonacci number n

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,840
so quarter

129
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,320
s0 is 1

130
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,639
f1 is 1 f2 ra is what

131
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,240
f1 plus f0 yeah

132
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,759
f3 is f2 plus f1 so so we store these

133
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,479
values in an array right now iteratively

134
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,800
right because to calculate fn we need a

135
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,440
fn minus 1 plus fn minus 2 right yeah so

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
we store this values in the array

137
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,320
and then we use this array to

138
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,680
iteratively

139
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
update

140
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,280
yeah

141
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,960
so in this case this would be if i to n

142
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,800
right

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,039
how about if we yeah let's just

144
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,560
transpose this matrix okay so this is i

145
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,759
to n

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,560
what i this i one to n and this is k

147
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,560
right so we calculate the first row yeah

148
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,880
we calculate the first row and then we

149
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,960
will calculate the second row

150
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,280
we use the value for the the previous

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,880
number when we calculate the third row

152
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,960
we use the value from the second row

153
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,080
right you see so we remember like

154
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,120
variance okay okay so let's uh convert

155
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,120
this to the

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,280
and first of all if they

157
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,000
okay so if the look if we have k if we

158
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,759
have n coins and if k is bigger than n

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,520
is it possible

160
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
now we should return what

161
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,720
uh

162
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,240
zero the probability is zero okay

163
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,880
so the

164
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,479
define let's say coins okay

165
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,600
and we have this probability p and k

166
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,639
right so first of all n equals length p

167
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,280
there are number of coins if

168
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,759
it's what k is bigger than n

169
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,759
we can

170
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
okay

171
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,360
yeah yeah i have two coins i want the

172
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,280
three heads no poster right make sense

173
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,639
yeah and now i have a tp4 very oh let's

174
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,199
call it f okay loosen up previously s

175
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,599
s i k right yeah

176
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,800
f i k we have k

177
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,840
balance right so now let's call it f

178
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,479
this is the two dimensional array so

179
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,160
let's initialize with zero

180
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,960
for underscore in range

181
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,639
so the k so that would be the k it'll be

182
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,000
k plus 1

183
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,440
up to k

184
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,240
and then for

185
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,880
the look at this table yeah this table

186
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,880
this table

187
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,599
this is i

188
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,319
and the coin i yeah up to end yeah we

189
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,160
are we are trying to fill in the table

190
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,759
okay flavor here

191
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,000
this is

192
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,039
paper paper

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,440
okay

194
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,479
and this is the one this is the

195
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,360
i and this is the top this is the k k is

196
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,280
the

197
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,160
from zero yeah the number of coins

198
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,160
facing up right

199
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,879
up to up to up to k okay

200
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,120
right

201
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,360
we are trying to fill in the value

202
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,479
here and the result will be

203
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
at

204
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,599
f

205
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,360
p k

206
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:12,479
uh okay s n k sorry f n minus k right f

207
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,400
n minus one so f one minus one

208
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,360
okay so the result

209
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,199
okay

210
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,440
so this is the return value we want to

211
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,319
calculate this already here right

212
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,000
okay

213
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,800
we're trying to fill in the value so

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,840
here we're going down one we calculate

215
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,919
the row one row by row and we have this

216
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,840
value this is the result this is the

217
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,440
result f

218
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,440
f n minus one

219
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,120
k okay

220
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,800
this is the value what are okay top down

221
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,720
remember the cache

222
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,160
the cache we asked computer to take this

223
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,240
value and that computer okay it needs to

224
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,240
find out this value for example yeah

225
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,240
okay this value needs to find out this

226
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,440
value for example and it's you know this

227
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,920
is top down

228
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,480
top down right yeah and then now butter

229
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,920
up i calculated no by now this is but up

230
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
makes sense

231
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,080
yeah just different ways of doing it

232
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,680
right so when the computer work out this

233
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,320
value you can't we put the cash it

234
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,839
remembers it now we remember here we

235
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,399
remember here yeah

236
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,519
so for i in

237
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,839
range

238
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,839
look the first one this is the column

239
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,120
this is the row okay this is the row and

240
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,240
how many rows are there are there

241
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,480
from

242
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:32,399
from zero to minus one minus one

243
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,240
and n drops okay and rows okay

244
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,240
okay so look f

245
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,640
we need to initialize the value yeah so

246
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,279
for this one the first coin

247
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,920
the first point

248
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,839
if it is zero

249
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,080
and then these two values what should we

250
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,600
initialize it

251
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,839
what what should we initial isaac

252
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
look the first coin

253
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,640
of facing down

254
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,760
the first coin or facing down is what

255
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,959
the first point of facing up is p right

256
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,200
p 0 right yeah the first point of facing

257
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,760
down is what

258
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,320
the p0 is the first point probability

259
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,920
the probability of facing up is p0

260
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
what's the probability of facing down

261
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,000
[Music]

262
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,519
one minus t zero here

263
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,959
yeah okay

264
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,640
twenty percent facing out what's the

265
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,560
probability you're facing down

266
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,560
eighty percent easy that's easy math

267
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,000
yeah one number one hundred percent is

268
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,640
one okay that's two representation okay

269
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,320
and then now we just try to put to four

270
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,680
i in

271
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,240
range

272
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,399
we start from the first row

273
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,880
especially we don't need to pick we we

274
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,720
don't need to calculate this value yeah

275
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,720
why is that

276
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,399
because the first point if i'm i'm

277
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,920
throwing the first coin

278
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,079
the k

279
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,760
these are all zero okay these are zero

280
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,839
what can you explain to me why this is

281
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,279
zero

282
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,240
because zero

283
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,200
times

284
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,240
whatever is no no no no why is this dude

285
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,040
i'm throwing the first coin and why i

286
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,440
can't get that f zero two f zero three f

287
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,760
g of y come on that's easy this is the

288
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,680
number this is the coin how many coins i

289
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,000
saw

290
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,760
you can't get anything for zero you just

291
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,760
get nothing

292
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,519
quite close zero is the first one i saw

293
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,519
the first coin what's the how many

294
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,000
outcomes do we

295
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,360
we have one how many outcomes

296
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,959
yeah

297
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,040
i saw the coin zero how many outcomes

298
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,800
two what's what are those

299
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,040
heads and tails heads here tails here

300
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,920
this is too hot i throw the coin that's

301
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,800
not impossible for to get two heads only

302
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,560
have one hat okay i throw two coins

303
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,560
okay so this is i saw two coins

304
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,560
zero heads one head two head got it so

305
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,480
this is always like that yeah

306
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,519
this bit

307
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:08,079
this bit is always zero when

308
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:10,639
i throw the coin and coins and i get k

309
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,279
k needs to be smaller than equal than n

310
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,839
right yeah if it's bigger than n returns

311
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,839
zero here

312
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,920
yeah

313
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,040
that's what i say here

314
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,160
this bit the outer triangle

315
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,920
this bit

316
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,959
i have a turn point

317
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,600
but i want to get a hundred heads

318
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,160
what's the probability

319
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,000
zero percent yeah three yeah

320
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,480
make sense yeah

321
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,480
now one end

322
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,279
and then i need to do four

323
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,399
j

324
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,440
in

325
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,920
range

326
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,399
f friendship i can

327
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,959
i can get it to i

328
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,040
look icon i can get into i or i can get

329
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,279
is i i think i can get it to i

330
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,120
i plus one

331
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,000
time to i plus one yeah r plus one yeah

332
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,920
uh

333
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,959
then i can say

334
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,440
um

335
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,240
if if you wish right because i have sold

336
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,560
end coins i have several end coins and

337
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,680
then this is the number of targets we

338
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,279
want to

339
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,360
yeah we

340
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,959
we also have a number of cat this is the

341
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,360
number of heads

342
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,959
half okay and then i can say f i j

343
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,440
yeah f i j

344
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,519
f i j look there are two possibilities

345
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,000
one one is the

346
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,079
the previous one is facing up so

347
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
previous one is p

348
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,600
i

349
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,800
what p i

350
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,760
times

351
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,079
f

352
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,959
i minus 1

353
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,480
times

354
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,360
j minus 1 yeah so this we want this coin

355
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,959
to face up so we have this probability

356
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,720
and then

357
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,320
yeah and then the previous one would be

358
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,320
j minus one right because we already

359
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,600
have one right plus

360
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,360
one minus p i this is the carbon cone

361
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,560
facing down and then i can say f

362
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,240
times f i minus 1

363
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,440
j right because the balance hasn't

364
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,360
changed right the balance hasn't changed

365
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,399
and then look we can look return this

366
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,639
here yeah

367
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,519
we can hear return

368
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,360
within the speed f

369
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,560
n minus one

370
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,920
okay

371
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,240
i

372
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,040
f minus one k

373
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,320
yeah

374
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,240
so look if j is more than i what will

375
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,240
happen if j is more than i

376
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,199
um

377
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,279
if j if j

378
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,760
is more than i so it's in the upper

379
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,800
corner then will become zero okay

380
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,959
and if i set it to target one uh let

381
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,199
will be target is k

382
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,160
k plus one here

383
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,519
does this still work

384
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,360
does this still work if j is more than i

385
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,079
is

386
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,320
j mullen i okay so it still works right

387
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,399
let's put it this way maybe more magma

388
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,399
clear okay but you have to remember that

389
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,480
the first upper corner is still always

390
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,240
there because there's no way

391
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,880
right if we have thrown the ice corn

392
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,279
we have thrown an ice coin

393
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,639
and we want to get a j hat yeah this is

394
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,000
what i mean

395
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,959
if i also i have solar icons and i have

396
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,199
concentrated jpegs it's the probability

397
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,079
of current i score and facing up this is

398
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,320
a probability breaking down probability

399
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,959
if i facing out it means i choose this

400
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,759
head choose this coin and facing up so i

401
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,639
have j minus one heads remaining

402
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,600
right

403
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,079
yeah

404
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,880
look i minus one what's i minus look i'm

405
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,880
here

406
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,360
i'm here what's it i'm what's i minus

407
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,360
one here

408
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,079
[Music]

409
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,639
i'm calculating this row what's i what's

410
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,959
the what's the previous note i minus one

411
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,160
note here right yeah

412
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,480
i look because you know this value

413
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,639
is based on previous row right so i

414
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,959
start from the first row and i use look

415
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,720
i start from filling the first row and

416
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,560
then i use the first row to calculate

417
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,600
the second row i use the second row to

418
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,480
take it in the third row i kill 0

419
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,920
yeah yeah look f i

420
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,720
is based on f i minus 1 right

421
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,959
right all right the horizontal this is

422
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,199
the number what what's k here what k

423
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,199
here

424
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,480
[Music]

425
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,000
okay can you explain to me last question

426
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,240
what's f i j

427
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,680
f i j is

428
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,639
like

429
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,519
like this is i

430
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,639
what's ij what does it mean here

431
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,940
this is i said you got i

432
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,079
coined yeah

433
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,079
[Music]

434
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,560
okay one english question english right

435
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,480
there when you say something about

436
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,720
what's the difference the number

437
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,720
and the amount

438
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,839
the number of coins and the amount of

439
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,839
coins which one is correct

440
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,679
you don't know i saw the number is that

441
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,559
you can count but the amount is

442
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,640
something you don't count like water you

443
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,400
don't count the amount of water the

444
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,439
number of coins

445
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,360
yeah

446
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959
yeah but we're not talking about water

447
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,839
yeah no i'm just saying that you say

448
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,000
amount of coins is that the right way of

449
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,120
saying it i don't know yeah

450
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,640
okay

451
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,559
okay what's the time complexity if you

452
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,559
look at this question this is easy

453
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,720
because look at this n and if this is up

454
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,600
to k it is o and k right but if this i

455
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,480
change this to k k is smaller than equal

456
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,520
than n so it's o n squared

457
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,320
the upper bound okay the outer part

458
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,160
makes sense if k is bigger than n

459
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,799
we return zero here

460
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,799
what's the space complexity

461
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,039
one

462
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,160
why you always say oh one what's the

463
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,520
space comedy i'm pointing to these

464
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,480
o minus

465
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,360
okay

466
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,360
o minus k plus one

467
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,360
um

468
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,120
bye bye
