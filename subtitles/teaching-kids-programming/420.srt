1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
oh hello hello guys

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,919
okay so today look we're gonna do a baby

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,160
tweet okay baby tree look at this it's a

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,400
tree yeah so how do we draw it i mean

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,559
any idea i mean look at this tree so we

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
want to draw the tree

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,240
wait wait wait so okay it's symmetry

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,760
yeah symmetry yes yes i look

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,000
i so

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,359
i can go i can draw these

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,279
trunk yeah

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,519
and then i can i need to draw the left

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,000
tree and the right subtree right and for

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,760
the left subtree again it's a small tree

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,040
right so basically you know the tree in

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,640
binary uh in in data science uh that

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,040
data structure is the

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,640
binary is recursive right do you still

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,200
remember yeah recursive so so we have a

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,120
so how do we define a tree class three

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,120
nodes right remember

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,840
object this is type of object and then

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,320
first of all we need to define init

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,760
constructor yeah so we have

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,920
a left tree yeah left tree

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,960
and then right here

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,119
so the left and right are the

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,600
the type of three notes yeah so

29
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,600
we can do it dot left equals left

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,920
something like that yeah this is the

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,680
three notes so basically the left trees

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,320
and the right trees are also type of

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
tree it's recursion defined and

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,240
and for the tree tree is the data

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,479
structure meaning that we can hold data

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,759
metadata in the three nodes right so

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,119
okay so

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,799
come back to this

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,960
we want to draw this tree

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,360
so first of all we draw the trunk

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,400
and then we need to turn that like let's

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,880
say 30 degree to draw the left tree

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,200
right and then we turn right

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,640
60 degrees to draw the right tree yeah

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,720
you need to draw it wise yeah and then

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,560
that'll be and when the tree size you

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,960
know one or three sides look this this

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,520
chunk for example this is this is longer

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,560
than that than this right so we can

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,759
decrement it using a uh portion right

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,880
percentage

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,640
right so after that when the size is

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,479
smaller than like for example like

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
smaller than 10 then we return we don't

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
want to keep continuing right because

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,959
the chunk is so small we don't

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,840
need to

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,080
drawing it right yeah so okay so first

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
of all we need to import

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
data import

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,959
import the

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
a few phones we can import everything or

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,319
we can you pull forward

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,360
forward backwards turn left turn right

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,319
okay

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,640
yeah

67
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,599
and then we also need to uh for example

68
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,920
we can reset we can

69
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,480
import color yeah color green

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,200
speed are you all right yeah yeah yeah

71
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,920
speed and then okay so h is the angle

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,720
yeah and angle of the angle of the you

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,040
know the heading heading so

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,120
zero means the right

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,760
horizontal right yeah

76
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,319
90 degree means to the north okay

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,680
okay and then we can define a tree so we

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,840
want the three or three this is the

79
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,760
recursion function or first of all the

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,280
size of the trunk size of the chunk yeah

81
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,519
so size of the

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,120
size of these size of chunk current size

83
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,319
of trunk and then the

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
t would be

85
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,319
something a constant

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,200
maybe we don't need to define the size

87
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,599
okay if uh 3 equals

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,319
three is the size and then

89
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,400
look if size is smaller than let's say

90
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,239
10 if it's smaller than 10 then we just

91
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,080
return we just don't continue yeah

92
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,760
because every question we need some

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,879
point to return

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,280
yeah then we need to walk forward with

95
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,920
the size okay so the ft size is this bit

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,480
yeah i want to follow this side yeah

97
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,360
okay and then

98
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,879
and then i need to turn 10 uh turn left

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,000
1930 degree yeah so i turn turn left 30

100
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,480
degree before making that way and then i

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,200
need to draw the right left sharp tree

102
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,959
left side subtree with size equal

103
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,400
size smaller let's say 60 okay 60 so

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,120
this size look every time the size is 60

105
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,439
percent of previous one so if this is

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,560
this if this is 100

107
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,439
yeah

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,560
if this the chunk is 100 this is 60 and

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,720
if this is 60 these the length of these

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,759
is 36 correct so every time i i draw a

111
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,160
smaller tree with a smaller size yeah

112
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,160
okay and then i need to turn 10 wide and

113
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,720
60 degrees okay so can you tell me why i

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,720
need to 10 by 60 degree where are we now

115
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,919
so you'll be turn now i'm here now

116
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,400
turn right

117
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,400
60 degree before facing that way drawing

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,840
the right tree yeah so again i need to

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,800
draw the

120
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,120
uh

121
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,919
right tree yeah right subtree yeah

122
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,919
yeah

123
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,040
right

124
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,720
yeah

125
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
can you can you look at the spring come

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,280
on

127
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,160
and then i need to turn this come back

128
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,240
to the north and then i need to back the

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,600
size i need to go back to where it

130
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,400
belongs right

131
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,400
yeah

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,440
okay then let's try it try to do it

133
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,120
reset okay let's reset and then we can

134
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,800
10 left 93

135
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,440
okay and then you're forcing now no see

136
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,479
another three 100

137
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,199
see

138
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,880
yeah you see it's drawing yeah you see

139
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,880
yeah that's how it draw the left tree

140
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,199
first and then draw the right tree yeah

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,199
so for each left tree you draw further

142
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,240
the smaller left tree all right we can

143
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,160
cut and then change

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,120
let's make it green and then let's draw

145
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,479
again

146
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,720
does it override yeah really yeah

147
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,720
make sense

148
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,600
so this 60 degree we uh

149
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,960
0.6 is the percentage of the

150
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,080
size so

151
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,240
so

152
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,880
let me expand again so this size is 100

153
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,560
right so this size is 60. these size at

154
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,039
least this size 36 and 36 times six 0.6

155
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,880
times 0.6 together so each each time

156
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,039
it's a smaller one right

157
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,840
yeah eric where are you are you right

158
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,639
okay i can see you you're there okay uh

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,600
so

160
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,160
okay so look turn that turn left knight

161
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,600
30 degree yeah and the draw is smaller

162
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,440
size and then turn right 60 degree and i

163
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,919
draw the right side and then i need to

164
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,560
go back go back to

165
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,560
uh go go back to where

166
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,039
this point so you'll be turned up to 30

167
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,039
degree and then go back yeah so this is

168
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,440
