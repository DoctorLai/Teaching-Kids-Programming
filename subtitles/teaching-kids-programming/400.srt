1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
hello mr area are you right yeah

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,120
okay well we talked about the graph

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,639
the other day yeah actually the day

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,480
before yesterday we talked about how to

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,719
clone a graph

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,440
the clone is the fancy word for copy

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,960
yeah

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,520
but for the copy we have two kinds of

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,359
copies deep copy and shallow copy

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,359
they copy is basically copying

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,320
everything yeah

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,599
make exactly copy so once you put a copy

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,000
like let's say a equals one two three

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,040
and then if we say b equals copy dot d

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,680
copy or we say we can use this

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,320
this is a d copy so a and b

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,879
both points to a list of one two three

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,320
they are independent of each other

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,559
yeah

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,360
so if i say a

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,120
0 equals like

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,039
4 for example it doesn't affect the

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,239
other copy right because it's totally

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,239
independent of copies

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,559
we talked about how to clone the graph

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,600
using the different search yes

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,840
definitely

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,320
the trick here is that because this

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,400
graph is

30
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,479
undirected connected graph right so so

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,479
we have the cycles for the graph yeah we

32
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,320
have cycle graph

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,920
cycles forecast so in order to avoid the

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,600
you know

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,119
endless

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,799
entities

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,960
and recycles yes we have to remember

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,840
we have to make we have to remember in

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,799
in the headset okay i said

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,360
so

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,000
we make a note here look we copy make a

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,119
note here and then we immediately mark

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,479
it as visited and then before we

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,640
clone

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,720
its neighbor it's kids it's neighbors

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,799
okay

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,520
so this is stephen search

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,640
what's the other way we can clone

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,079
traverse a

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,759
graph

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,640
what's the other way

52
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,840
okay

53
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,320
[Music]

54
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,360
we are talking about this is stephen

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,200
search calling itself that research

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,680
yeah what's the other way of traveling

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,680
the graph

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,680
um

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,000
so

60
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,720
let's say if i have a graph like that if

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,640
i have a graph

62
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,840
like one

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,560
two

64
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,599
three four

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,840
five

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,840
okay

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,239
okay

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,840
so let's say we have got this way

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,080
if i start if i if i'm given this null

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,040
here what's the perfect search order of

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,720
this graph one two three five four

72
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,879
one two three

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,640
five four yeah whether yeah or you can

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,080
say one three two

75
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,360
four five it doesn't matter here because

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,160
the

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,680
yeah

78
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,319
because this the

79
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,480
the graph right the graph doesn't have

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,599
it's not like a binary tree you have the

81
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,680
left and right yeah expensively for the

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,560
graph you can say okay i visit this

83
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,680
first

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,760
as long as it's next yeah three two four

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,200
five okay so in order to implement a

86
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,159
perfect search normally what kind of

87
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,239
data structure can we use

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,519
do you still remember

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:24,400
q and in python what how can we declare

90
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,599
a cube eq cq what's dq mean

91
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,000
what

92
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,159
yeah what does it mean double ended

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,159
it means

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,840
so

95
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720
we can look double ended means that we

96
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,599
can

97
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,840
pop and push in both both ends

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,200
both sides okay

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
so

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,239
let's

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,239
let's revisit the breakfast search okay

102
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,159
okay for example is this one

103
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,200
first of all i put the one in

104
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
yeah

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,879
okay

106
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,799
now i take one out

107
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,879
so what should i do

108
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,720
you should

109
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:22,240
push in two or three two and three

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,600
okay so now what i what should i do

111
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,600
what's the next to pop up

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,040
yeah but what's to do with two and three

113
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
so what should i do with two and three

114
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,199
okay two and take it what and what

115
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,800
should i do next

116
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,080
four four alright what should i do next

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,080
doing three

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,080
yeah

119
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,840
okay so let's just quickly write this

120
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,800
and then we can we can see how we can

121
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,440
clone

122
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,720
chrome graph and directly okay what

123
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,720
squat by the way graph

124
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,160
did i say that structure it's the vertex

125
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,160
and edges yeah they still remember yeah

126
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,280
okay so let's say let's let's implement

127
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,840
this question search clone graph

128
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,479
uh so we have given the node here we're

129
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,120
giving the node

130
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,199
if not now

131
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,720
if we're given the empty thing we just

132
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,880
return yeah

133
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,199
easy return

134
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,840
okay all right

135
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:33,039
so now we have a q equals t q

136
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,199
and now we put the node in

137
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,560
okay

138
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,440
yeah

139
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,880
there you are what you doing

140
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,639
so now look

141
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,080
wire

142
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,560
cue

143
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,520
but we have we need to have a

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,600
have a

145
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,720
notebook hash set to remember the notes

146
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,840
we will be visiting here so let's say we

147
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,479
begin with putting a set

148
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,800
so this is kind of a standard uh

149
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,800
template for the process search using uh

150
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,199
eq so first we take a note from the

151
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,160
in front of curia this is like q this is

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,560
q

153
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,639
and then we take it out with current we

154
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,560
take this current out okay

155
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,440
currently equals q the power

156
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,840
cube the power

157
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,639
for black

158
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,280
okay so now we have a no no we have

159
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,240
having the kids yeah so we have say

160
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,680
we we have uh we have to iterate the

161
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,240
kids of it so for n in

162
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,000
in current the neighbors yeah the

163
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,919
neighbors oh we call it the children

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,160
yeah it doesn't matter

165
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,650
the name let's call it neighbors

166
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,760
neighbors

167
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,760
[Music]

168
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,800
a-i-g-h-b-o-r-s okay then

169
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,400
if n not in

170
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,840
not in scene

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,560
okay

172
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,639
then we we sing

173
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,720
the add

174
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,560
n n right

175
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,160
and then we need to push the n to the

176
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,000
append and to the

177
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,080
to the q so what should i put here

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,160
open y

179
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,160
open what what are the keys

180
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,319
yeah

181
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,960
i know we want to return if we visited

182
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,479
we want to return the loot okay no

183
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,639
okay

184
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,639
so

185
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,479
so we

186
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,599
this is just a template to

187
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,680
to visit the traverse graph that graph

188
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,919
now we we have to

189
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,360
clone it we have to copy why we

190
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,080
translate it

191
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,360
so first of all

192
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,240
first of all

193
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,720
see this is a set let's change it to

194
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,720
uh um

195
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,160
see let's say let's say we have uh

196
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,960
we have a dictionary we have a mapping

197
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,560
yeah we have a table hash table so this

198
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,120
one is a paper

199
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,360
so we have a scene

200
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,360
so since this is

201
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,280
changed from the headset

202
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,360
the headset is the lock stores the

203
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,080
number of nodes we have visited but

204
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,120
instead we wanted to store

205
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
the

206
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
mapping from the original node to the

207
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,919
terminal okay so the key will be the

208
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,800
original node now value would be the

209
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,560
copied no no let's copy so

210
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,600
at the beginning now

211
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,360
i should give it a clone this is i let

212
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,760
me copy here

213
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,680
look uh node know the value

214
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,440
and then the neighbors would be empty

215
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,560
this right so

216
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,519
so look we have we have just copy one

217
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,440
node which is that node yeah so then we

218
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,680
instead of reading the node we tell it's

219
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,920
copy which is same

220
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,880
no okay

221
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,200
yeah

222
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,200
now

223
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,200
now i

224
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,800
i have to do something here right so

225
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,120
instead of

226
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,760
now look the neighbor the neighbor is

227
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,480
not being seen the label is not being

228
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,519
copied so we have to copy here so that's

229
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,519
right here scene

230
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,839
node

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,519
scene

232
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,760
but now equals node we copy this now

233
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,279
yeah we're using this syntax end of

234
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,279
value

235
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,160
okay

236
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,360
q dot 10 okay uh

237
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,839
now

238
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,320
i have etched okay so actually this

239
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,959
needs to be moved uh predom when it's

240
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,800
not seen so i have to write it here q

241
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,560
dot append

242
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,279
okay okay

243
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,279
so when we only append

244
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,040
we only push the note

245
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,200
back to the queue when it's not being

246
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,680
visited right when it's visited there's

247
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,680
no point to append it right

248
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,959
so now here at this point we are here

249
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,240
so we should do what we should we should

250
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,760
please sin and this note here

251
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,560
into

252
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,640
uh into the neighbor of the current

253
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,640
right remember this current thing

254
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,880
this current thing okay this current

255
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,640
thing at the beginning when it's copied

256
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,640
it's given is given an empty list and as

257
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,320
a neighbor so we have to do

258
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,040
to this current

259
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,040
the neighbors

260
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,279
neighbors

261
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,279
don't attend

262
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,399
so

263
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,399
because

264
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,959
n is the neighbor of current right so

265
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:02,000
what does this mean is that okay so we

266
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,720
we already know we already copied

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,440
make a copy of current

268
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,360
yeah many copy of current which is is

269
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,959
stored in the same current right

270
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,880
remember this has map this scene

271
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,079
seen yeah the keys

272
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,440
keys this original note original note

273
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,680
like a note

274
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,040
and then the value would be

275
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,839
la

276
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,000
copied no right so this is no dot

277
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,200
value yeah

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
okay

279
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,600
so scene current this is the copy this

280
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,480
is the copy of the current node

281
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
and its neighbor needs to

282
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,040
append

283
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,040
c

284
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,600
n and look

285
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,480
n is uh n is the neighbor of current

286
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,160
right

287
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,920
yeah look n is the neighbor of current

288
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,760
okay so

289
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,519
so what is copy

290
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:02,639
sin

291
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:05,279
n is a copy c n is a neighbor of

292
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,160
sin current yeah simple as that yeah

293
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,240
look

294
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,200
the original note is current it has a

295
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,320
neighbor n right so i'm already copy i

296
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,600
copy this current to sim current

297
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,440
right so i already copied n to c n so

298
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,480
what's left to do i have to

299
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
append

300
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,040
these to the neighbors or that right

301
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,079
make sense you see this is the graph i

302
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,440
copy this one too right this is original

303
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,880
now i copy and i don't know which is one

304
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
dash

305
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,680
and i copy another which is two dash

306
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,639
this is end this is current so what's

307
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,200
next

308
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,200
what's next

309
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,920
there is

310
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,399
edge missing right yeah yeah that's

311
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,360
missing look at this this just copy the

312
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,839
note

313
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,279
this is just copy the note right but i

314
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,760
have to add edge

315
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,200
if i am i'm adding an edge how can i add

316
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,839
an edge what

317
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,079
how how do we represent the edges in in

318
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,839
this kind of graph where is the edges

319
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,600
being

320
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,360
added which one is the edge added how do

321
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,160
you how do you how do we know you know

322
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,639
one is connected to two

323
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,639
things

324
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,399
which property of the node look now has

325
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,160
a value and has the neighbors neighbors

326
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,399
yeah neighbor is the list of vertex it

327
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,240
connects to right so here same current

328
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,279
the name of the open

329
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,120
scene

330
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:34,639
and which means what scene current

331
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,440
has the edge connects to sin

332
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,639
and

333
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,600
right

334
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,320
okay

335
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,560
okay so then that's uh lots of uh

336
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,480
how the edges are represented using this

337
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,279
kind of wow which is called adjacent

338
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,880
risk rotation is like a vertice

339
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,800
is a vertex is the key and the value is

340
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,800
the list of vertex it connects to that's

341
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,320
the adjacent magic adjacent list okay

342
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,839
[Music]

343
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,079
uh the time complexity is still the same

344
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,760
yeah use as compared to data search all

345
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,160
n plus m yeah where o in percent
