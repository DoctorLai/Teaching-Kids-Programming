1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,359
go

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:09,040
hello hello mr mr ryan how are you today

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,440
we have talked about air is longest

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,840
increasing subsequence longest

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,840
increasing what's subsequent yeah

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,840
subsequence

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,640
what's the difference between

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,800
subsequence and supplement array or

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,519
sub-list

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:33,040
which one is continuum okay so look

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,880
third one three two four one seven

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,440
okay ten

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
sub list continues so it has to continue

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,079
yeah

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,399
yeah and usually we start sub this

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,640
program we can we can proof us in o and

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,360
square time right because you always we

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,320
can try every possibility of a of sub

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,440
list

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,039
by determining the left point

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,960
and then profiling the right point

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,559
that's o n squared but for subsequence

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,640
what's the subsequence

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,960
each subsequence you take

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,520
arbitrary number of elements from the

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,840
original way you delete it yeah and then

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
the remaining is the subsequence for

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,200
example it does not have to be continued

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,560
like three four

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,799
seven or

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,960
three two four yeah two seven six okay

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,439
two seven six is this the subsequence or

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,439
something

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,520
with subsequence

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,680
yeah okay you're listening okay okay so

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,920
long what's the longest subsequence in

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,200
this case what's the longest subsequence

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,119
what's the longest subsequence

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,439
everywhere what's the longest subsequent

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,759
three two four one seven takes ten

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,159
longest increasing subsequent okay

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,159
increasing substance

43
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,960
[Music]

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,799
but you're right about subsequent i

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,880
didn't say increasing yeah

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,920
it's the whole thing yeah

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,240
great job

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,799
and increasing

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,200
sorry increasing increasing one

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,200
uh all i can find is pen

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,280
two for

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,840
increasing subsequence you know it does

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,119
not have to continue the longest

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,200
like

55
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,479
the longest subsequent which one you

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,800
don't get it

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,879
long um like long it's increasing

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,440
increasing like two four seven this is

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,800
increasing always increasing subsequence

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,800
uh one two three four

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,810
[Music]

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,720
you pick it longest including subsequent

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,720
remember we talk about subsequence

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,360
okay

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,239
okay okay

66
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,340
[Music]

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,840
so it's all four yeah the longest will

68
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,840
be of four lengths of four

69
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,159
one

70
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
one

71
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,720
two

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,519
one one

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
two

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,360
three

75
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,280
yeah

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,400
yes four yeah

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,800
okay

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,800
okay okay

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,080
so

80
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,519
previously

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,760
do you remember we talked about this

82
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,400
we have we talked about this using what

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,840
kind of agreement you know if if we use

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,080
the tp what's db dynamic programming

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,519
okay if i use dpi

86
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,599
representing the longest length

87
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,159
of subsequence the longest increasing

88
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,040
subsequent that ends at index i right

89
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,200
okay

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,440
so that longest

91
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,480
increasing subsequence

92
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,720
ends

93
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,840
at index i

94
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,519
index i okay so for example like here

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,400
that's index

96
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,480
look so dp value at here will be 2 right

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,760
because longest ending at index it will

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,360
be 3 4 will be 2 right yeah and how

99
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,799
about look 7 is bigger than 4 right

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,720
look 7 is bigger than four right yeah

101
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,840
so what does it mean so what's the vp

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,000
value here

103
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,880
four seven

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,079
four

105
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,639
so look

106
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,960
dp2 here is two

107
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,560
because i found that longest increasing

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,520
subsequent and the index 2 is 2 right

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,120
and i know 7 is bigger than 4 so what

110
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,880
does it mean

111
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,880
so the dpi dp here at this value

112
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,120
will be

113
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,120
here plus one right because look seven

114
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
is bigger than four what i need to do is

115
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,639
i put a seven at the end of the previous

116
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,560
longest subsequent and it will have

117
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,600
another more one more right

118
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,199
right

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,800
right so

120
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,960
so dp right so let's dp

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,960
i will be maximum

122
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,759
dpi

123
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,840
and dp j plus one to j

124
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,039
plus

125
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,400
one right

126
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,880
for

127
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,160
j smaller than

128
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,600
i

129
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,840
n

130
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,000
and what's nums

131
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,960
num nums i

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,840
bigger than number three okay so that's

133
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,240
the tp function right

134
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,120
listen to me one more time okay

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,280
so dpi is the longest increasing

136
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,759
subsequence the length of the longest

137
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,199
increasing subsequent and the index i

138
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,600
and what is the equal i just have to

139
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,880
keep updating this for j smaller than i

140
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,639
if none sign bigger than j okay

141
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,840
make sense

142
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,919
no that's no no no this is okay let's do

143
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,000
the curve yeah but you're right yeah

144
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,600
so why why this is working why because

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,199
because i just said look

146
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
if i know

147
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,280
db what's the d what's the advantage of

148
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,360
us using dp we want to avoid repeatedly

149
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,919
calculating the values right so i have

150
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,479
dpi meaning that the longest the length

151
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,800
of longest subsequence

152
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,600
increasing subsequent that's an index i

153
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
right

154
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,039
and

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,039
if i found another value

156
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,240
right which is bigger than the current

157
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,960
value so i want all i all we can do

158
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,880
is put a one append one because we

159
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,000
already found one more subsequence that

160
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,560
has the

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,479
one more length right has one more has a

162
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,880
size of one more right look

163
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,039
look there we go whatever comes here

164
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,199
right because the longest increasing

165
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,680
subsequence ends here is four right and

166
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,840
then i found seven is bigger than four

167
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,340
so what does

168
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,800
mean what does it mean

169
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,680
[Music]

170
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,000
what does it mean it means we plus one

171
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,599
plus one yeah plus one because look this

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,520
is the longest subsequent we have five

173
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,599
so far and then we know seven is bigger

174
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,840
than four so all we have to do is put a

175
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,520
seven as a previous subsequence i know

176
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,120
we have a

177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,919
longer subsequence

178
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,919
we size one more right less the less the

179
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,440
dp less the dynamic programming yeah

180
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,919
because we already save here so we

181
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,280
already keep updating here and for this

182
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,520
one yeah

183
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,680
the times of next is o n square right

184
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,199
because we for each eye we need to go

185
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,960
through the j

186
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,759
uh smaller than i okay let's just

187
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,160
quickly implement this

188
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:36,319
let's just quickly implement define lis

189
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,360
array okay they would need to be capital

190
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,240
there is no capital okay

191
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,280
if not array just make it

192
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,199
uh

193
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,240
yellow that's r

194
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,319
okay

195
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,080
and then n equals length means of a r

196
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,639
and then we need the dp value yeah at

197
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,919
the beginning will be one right

198
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,080
make sense

199
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,919
because each individual element is a

200
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,680
subsequent it's the longest increasing

201
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,360
subsequent right

202
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,240
and now for

203
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
i

204
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,960
in

205
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,720
range

206
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,560
n right and then

207
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,840
for look for j any every other element

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,879
every and every element every index js

209
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,199
in is smaller than i right in range

210
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,160
up to i

211
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,479
if

212
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,599
if array

213
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,840
i right if array i is bigger than array

214
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,080
drag j

215
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,800
so then with dp

216
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,279
i right

217
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,279
we have dpi will be what equals maximum

218
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,039
dpi

219
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,360
and then dp

220
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,399
j plus one right this is all we talked

221
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,399
about right yeah

222
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,680
return what

223
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,560
that's the interest now what do we

224
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,959
return dp dpy we want to return the

225
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,040
longest increasing subsequent

226
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,920
max of one db

227
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,279
yeah good guy down

228
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,600
i did say dp why is that because dpi is

229
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,519
the longest the length of longest

230
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,240
subsequent increasing subsequent ending

231
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,160
the index line and we want to find the

232
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,800
length of longest increasing subsequent

233
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,880
that could end at any index right so

234
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,000
let's that's why we got the max dp

235
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,000
what's the time complexity

236
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,959
ten

237
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,839
[Music]

238
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,360
seven

239
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,440
eight

240
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,000
ten he said we're gonna do it for ten

241
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,680
minutes okay already nearly done okay

242
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,959
okay come on listen to me

243
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,279
listen to me

244
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,279
now ten minutes

245
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,120
what's the what's the longest increasing

246
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,360
subsequence here

247
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,800
what's the longest increasing subsequent

248
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,519
the length of longest increasing

249
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,519
substance 3 7 8 10 3 7 8 and 4 okay

250
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,519
so we can

251
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,200
we have another agreement right so we

252
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,480
can have at least longest increasing

253
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,240
subsequence right at least

254
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,720
and then we can build it

255
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,839
yeah we can build it along the way so

256
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,519
look how can i build it look look how

257
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,440
competitive so at the beginning we don't

258
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,240
we we have nothing right so how are we

259
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,240
doing three

260
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,880
so where to so let's see this is

261
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,079
increasing subsequent it should be

262
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,680
sorted right

263
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,920
this will be sorted

264
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,360
yeah it's salty right because it's salty

265
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,279
right the longest

266
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,800
increasing subsequent increasing

267
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,560
substitution what does it mean it's

268
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,640
sorted

269
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,560
so three if i'm going to put it in a

270
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,399
longer subsequent way it's going to be

271
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,720
it's empty now so i can just put it

272
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,839
there right so longest subsequence will

273
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,800
be

274
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,560
three

275
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,839
okay

276
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,160
two

277
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,120
we're going to put it here in the salted

278
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,279
is

279
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,760
it should be before three yeah

280
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,040
remember yesterday we talked about what

281
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,120
buy

282
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,680
buy sell collect and buy right

283
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,760
left if we buy send here so where to put

284
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,079
it we should place here yeah yeah this

285
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,120
is the place to put put a two in so i

286
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,480
replace it in two

287
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,320
why is that

288
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,720
why is that because if

289
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,680
i don't know what's happening afterwards

290
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,480
but all i can i know is that if i change

291
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,839
the three to two

292
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,720
it will only make a result better

293
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,560
am right because three is two i'm

294
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,880
changing the sequence of

295
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,880
a big number to a smaller number so it

296
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,480
doesn't make the these are bad words

297
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,959
right

298
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,959
but what

299
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,440
because three

300
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,360
can you put like three three

301
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,760
three there's only one sweet here yeah

302
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,680
what if there's like two or the same one

303
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,680
can you put them together

304
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,920
good question very good question like

305
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,000
they're two tens no because long is

306
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,920
increasing increasing three three is not

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,480
increasing

308
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,560
right it's not included

309
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,160
it's we only have one three because if

310
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,839
there are two three you can put you this

311
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,200
is not increasing this this is not

312
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,680
increasing right

313
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,360
right so look so what well

314
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,040
what did i say so

315
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,680
previously long is increasing something

316
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,320
like three now i have two right i mean

317
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,680
two so i can change these to two

318
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,720
three to two

319
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,959
and this doesn't make the result worse

320
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,880
right because i'm changing a sequence i

321
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,800
don't know what's up after but all i

322
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,399
know is that i change a big number to a

323
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,680
smaller number

324
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,120
yeah you will not make the result worse

325
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,200
you will only make the result better

326
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,200
yeah because there's some for example

327
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,440
there's another number 2.5 here

328
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,320
previously 3 is decreasing but now i

329
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,880
change it to 2 in my increasing right i

330
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,120
might pick this in the future

331
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,639
right so let's quit it so i change this

332
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,480
i use the bicep left yeah bisect that

333
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,399
to find out the place there are three

334
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,240
and i change it to two okay

335
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,639
ten where it's going to put in the

336
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,240
saltine here at the end at the end so

337
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,720
i'm putting it here

338
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,959
seven where are they gonna put five six

339
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,120
left ten ten yeah so i replace this

340
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,880
again i replace these two seven yeah

341
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,000
because i changed ten to seven what does

342
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,639
it mean

343
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,240
yeah the result could only get better

344
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,519
right

345
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,519
hey where's the looper

346
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,800
after seven then i put it

347
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,639
what's the time come back to your face

348
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,399
i've logged in

349
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,839
logan so all together o n logan which is

350
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,600
better

351
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,920
this is better or all square which is

352
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,000
better i look l and go again this is

353
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,600
better yeah we find the better ever yeah

354
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,519
makes sense you understand your answer

355
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,519
yeah perfect let's let's do this

356
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,839
define longest increasing subsequent all

357
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,800
right

358
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,940
and we need to have our air

359
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,880
and empty this yeah

360
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,160
[Music]

361
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,680
no no no no for the variables it's okay

362
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,720
it's okay

363
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,680
then we thought we'd also list four i

364
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,360
in

365
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,360
a r okay then we call this x equals

366
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,279
bisect remember bicep

367
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,320
what's the five cent left yeah why is

368
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,720
the left

369
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,720
the first parameter would be the

370
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,160
ar

371
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,399
and the secondary

372
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,000
no no no we're going to buy in the list

373
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,279
yeah in the list

374
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,480
and then i yeah

375
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,600
if

376
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,079
what

377
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,959
s equal or equal length

378
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,360
the position is the at the end right it

379
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,199
means that we can put it at the end

380
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,680
we can put it at the end right

381
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,639
we can put it how can we put the element

382
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,240
i in the end of this

383
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,199
this

384
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,240
dot what's the method we put up we put

385
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,880
this

386
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,279
we put this i we want to put this i in

387
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,279
the list

388
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,560
a pen yeah

389
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,360
apparent i i oh you can do this a i s

390
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,720
plus equal i this is also okay this is

391
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,600
the same thing okay this is the same

392
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,560
thing

393
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,480
otherwise we just need to change what a

394
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,800
is one

395
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,920
y equals one

396
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,639
okay so what look

397
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,800
what did i just just say 7 10

398
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,320
and if i have a value a i want to

399
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,440
replace this with a

400
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,160
anybody

401
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,320
uh we uh change the time

402
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,120
so x equals what

403
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,519
so the x is bicep yeah we got this

404
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,759
position in the position and equals to

405
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,560
the number yeah which is i

406
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,000
right and we just need to return what we

407
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,519
can

408
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,519
say come on listen easy

409
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,480
return what's the length of the longest

410
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,600
increasing subsequently

411
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,120
length of

412
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,480
less

413
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,079
this yeah this this okay

414
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,839
make sense

415
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,720
make

416
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,519
sense yeah let's just double check

417
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,320
yeah i think it's uh

418
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,680
all right yeah it's all right

419
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,160
okay so

420
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,279
so this one we call ingredient because

421
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,880
we quit it every time we

422
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,279
we find a smaller number

423
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,160
yeah we find a small number we replace

424
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,560
the one in the list with that position

425
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,600
because always keep this maintaining a

426
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,520
sorted ais right so we replace it we

427
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,120
place it we created the place and i know

428
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,160
give us the result

429
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,199
yeah

430
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,640
all right yeah

431
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,880
what's the time complexity for this one

432
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,880
again

433
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,759
what's the space capacity for this one

434
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,759
[Music]

435
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,720
in the worst case is one everything is

436
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,799
increasing one two three four five so

437
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,880
this you know the list will contain this

438
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,600
one two three four five okay this

439
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,880
longest increasing subsequence

440
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,559
makes sense

441
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,360
so the first one dynamic programming

442
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,960
yeah

443
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,679
programming you understand yeah and this

444
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,360
one is greedy no no no no let me program

445
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,520
it on square

446
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,520
remember and space complexity

447
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,919
okay that's it for today good job

448
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,720
bye bye

449
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,720
bye bye
