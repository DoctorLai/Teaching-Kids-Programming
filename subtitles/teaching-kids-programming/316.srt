1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
hello

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,799
hello mr mr ryan how are you today

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,240
okay i guess you're all good yeah um so

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,559
you know that was shuffling shuffling

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,400
yeah you know snap shuffling what's it

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,000
doesn't mean you know you know you're

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,000
not the car you're playing the poker

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,480
poker games yeah poker cast you shuffle

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,760
it pokemon cards yeah your pokemon

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
shuffle them

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,320
yeah shuffle is the way to make a random

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,359
permutation it's so it's a random

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
permutation okay random permanent random

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,280
permutation

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,719
do you still remember the permutation

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,719
permutation

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,640
this is what yeah

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,640
this is p yeah and we talk about a

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,600
combination as well right

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
yeah

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,960
combinations okay look let's review a

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,559
little bit

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,920
all right

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,960
i have a

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,000
one two three three numbers

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,920
what's the possible permutation of it

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,559
what's the possible permutation how many

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,879
ways of permutation six yeah can you

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,760
give us a few examples

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,920
one two three yeah definitely of course

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,680
it's one of them

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,479
one three two

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,880
two one three

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,880
i said

35
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,670
[Music]

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,439
yeah the way how we compute the

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,360
permutation for permutation if there are

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,759
n numbers how many ways of doing the

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,759
permutation remember what's the what's

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,600
the answer what's up

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,479
if there are n numbers what's the how

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,320
many numbers how many commu full

43
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,200
communication of n numbers

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,439
if let's n if 3 is 6

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,320
yeah f 3 equals 6

46
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,920
if f 4 equals 1

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,240
if there are 4 numbers how many ways of

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,240
doing it

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,479
no of course not

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,240
for permutation remember the first one

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,280
we have n choice

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,280
yeah 24 yes the second one we have y and

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,160
minus one choice the third one we have n

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,680
minus two and here one and what's this

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,440
and

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,599
factorial yeah that's the full

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,160
computation there we go and combination

58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,400
combination is not uh with

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,160
the order does not matter right if we

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,239
pick one two three if we pick two

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,599
numbers out of three how how many ways

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,680
of doing that

63
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,720
you choose one and three yeah one and

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,200
two one

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,760
and three why are they you could use two

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,599
and three and that's it yeah

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,519
picking two numbers out of three is the

68
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,200
same as picking one number out of three

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
right because look if you pick one two

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,519
you left the three you pick one three

71
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,840
you left two you picked two three you

72
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,760
left one right it's the same yeah

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,760
all right it corresponds to each other

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,160
picking two numbers out of three is the

75
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,599
same as picking one number out of three

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,280
correct make sense

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,080
so look c

78
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,200
and

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,680
picking m numbers out of n

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,560
is the same as picking

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,640
n minus m numbers out of n okay makes

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,280
sense that's the equation here

83
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,440
okay okay our computation okay we talked

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,040
about okay we're not talking about

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,080
permutation and

86
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,920
computing

87
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,280
combination today we're talking about

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,560
shuffling

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,680
so

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,640
shuffling

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,720
yeah

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,920
so look at this one two three one two

93
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,920
three shuffling

94
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,239
we just talked about six possibilities

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,319
and we went to shuffling so each

96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,400
possibility needs to be a probability

97
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,760
yeah we talk about probability

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,319
needs to be

99
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,720
one over six yeah all right

100
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,040
okay there's six possibility of three

101
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,360
cards and one shuffling and each one has

102
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,840
to appear one over six this is called

103
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,879
unbiased what's unbiased

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
and

105
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,640
buyers

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,319
what's buyers

107
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,599
what's buyers what's the meaning of

108
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,640
buyers

109
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,319
uh

110
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,319
they're based on

111
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,319
um

112
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,640
is like you know you have preference for

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,560
some combination of for some permutation

114
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,680
for example

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,920
okay

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,920
okay

117
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,280
okay listen to me bias

118
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,880
is means that look there are six

119
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,759
possibilities yeah let's do this again

120
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,080
okay two one three two one one three one

121
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,600
two three two one so look there's six

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,320
possibilities i don't want to do the

123
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,800
random shuffling each one has to appear

124
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,280
roughly you know ideally you'll be one

125
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,919
over six probability but if i said okay

126
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,320
i i prefer this one more i want to say i

127
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,639
like this sequence you know so

128
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,560
this is biased you know if you if you

129
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,360
approach to shuffle

130
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,320
has more probability of these

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,080
yeah

132
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,280
then it's buyers

133
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,520
make sense

134
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,880
inspires so we don't want that buyer's

135
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,400
permutation we want to

136
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,840
advise three three two one okay good

137
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,000
choice

138
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,600
okay so we uh this is shuffling and then

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,919
we could

140
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,759
let's say i have a number i have this

141
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,360
one two three number i want to shuffle

142
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,360
it how can we shuffle it

143
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,960
so one way of checking it is least right

144
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,240
we can choose

145
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,720
yeah yeah yeah

146
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,639
yeah yeah yeah okay okay how do we do

147
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,240
this how do we do this how do we do it

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,680
okay okay

149
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,440
yeah okay that's enough enough

150
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,960
in order to do shuffling we need to kind

151
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,800
of bring in this randomness in

152
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,280
randomness we talk about a random random

153
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,639
thing uh remember that in the lesson of

154
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,479
uh

155
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,039
what do we call we call this circle yeah

156
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,039
calculus

157
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,039
yeah this is a square and then it's a

158
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,680
quarter of certain we

159
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,600
start to throw the chocolate coins on it

160
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,680
yeah and we count how many coins are

161
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
falling inside the circle and if we

162
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,919
divide it by the number of the coins

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,280
together coins and we get roughly the

164
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,960
proportion of

165
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,280
a quarter pi right right this is

166
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,840
multi-color randomness and when we use

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,919
that randomly we use the random function

168
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,479
random function from the random package

169
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,720
generates a number between

170
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,919
bigger or equal to zero and smaller than

171
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,080
one right

172
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,600
and it also has other function which is

173
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,800
called rand

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,360
in

175
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,120
given two numbers a b you will return a

176
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,120
number random okay random

177
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,880
from a to b

178
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,720
inclusive okay

179
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,039
and similarly we have another function

180
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,039
called run range right remember this

181
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,919
range function

182
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,600
running function a b c right

183
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,520
c is the step option a b

184
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,919
random a b

185
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,400
you will come up with the number bigger

186
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,240
than equal and a as smaller than b right

187
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,120
right or if it's rand if you if you

188
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,759
if you just call run age is equal it's

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:07,520
similar it's equivalent to rent range

190
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:10,160
zero a yeah this is the same yeah

191
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,280
so if we put a random here random range

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,120
render range okay i think it's red range

193
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,360
red range so basically you would

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
generate an integer between this range

195
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,240
yeah

196
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,680
random range okay

197
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,599
makes sense

198
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
so why are we using this random function

199
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,039
so we can do this

200
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,039
we can generate the function uh

201
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,720
so you tell me okay

202
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,280
so look if i this is one two three if i

203
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,319
repeat if i repeat three times that if

204
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,280
there are n numbers if i repeat n times

205
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,960
and every time i generate a number

206
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,080
between zero

207
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,879
to three

208
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,720
right zero to two right zero one two

209
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,639
and every time i generate this number

210
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,000
and i swap it

211
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,960
yeah

212
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,199
right

213
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,599
so for example the first time i generate

214
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,080
this is two and i swap what

215
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,599
i will swap uh

216
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,720
zero to i will swap the i

217
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,680
to

218
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,840
repeat n times okay so this is zero to

219
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,120
[Music]

220
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,840
uh let's say

221
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,840
four if i for i in range

222
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,440
and i

223
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,840
right

224
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:29,759
look if i if i repeat n times and

225
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:31,680
i generate a number which is in a rent

226
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,880
range

227
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,800
red range

228
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,440
n and i will swap i will swap

229
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,560
so numbers

230
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,560
x and numbers i

231
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,120
yeah and if i look at least n times if i

232
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,600
run the niche

233
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,360
you know pick a number and i sort it

234
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,040
yeah this could be one way of doing but

235
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,320
there's a problem with this why is that

236
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,959
look

237
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,880
if i pick one this number and i swap it

238
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,360
with this

239
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,760
right so that will become

240
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,000
two one three

241
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,000
right

242
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,080
and again i'm here right if i again i

243
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,360
pick this number

244
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,440
and i stop it

245
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,399
you become one two three

246
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,640
again so what's the problem is that one

247
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,080
number could be swapped more than once

248
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,480
but ideally it should be

249
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,480
one time if you repeat n times

250
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,320
so what's the probability of each number

251
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,839
being swapped

252
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,120
come on that's an easy question if it's

253
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
a unbiased one

254
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,440
there are numbers and numbers i want to

255
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,320
look i want to swap it i want to perform

256
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,320
this swapping

257
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,040
and one over n right because then if i

258
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,279
do this n times

259
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,000
right so each number needs to be

260
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,839
probability though and one over n's yeah

261
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,920
for it to be swap right

262
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,920
make sense

263
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,640
make sense

264
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,560
yeah but if if there's one number which

265
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,320
is smaller than this probability then it

266
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,880
means other number is less than this

267
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,279
probability yeah got it right

268
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,600
right and what could happen if the

269
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,519
one number is more than n

270
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,079
it's being picked and the other number

271
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,399
is unless it's not being picked but it's

272
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,320
not it's not giving you and buyers right

273
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,200
right make sense

274
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
so

275
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,680
one way of checking if your solution is

276
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,240
buyers or unbiased is that

277
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,320
it's numbers right if we randomly

278
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,480
shuffling shuffling swapping

279
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,000
if render is as you know perform this

280
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,240
shuffling

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,560
and bacterial times

282
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,360
unfortunate sense

283
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,519
so each uh each permutation has to

284
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,519
appear more you know

285
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,399
one time yeah on average right because

286
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,040
this is probability and if we repeat

287
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,200
this shuffling if we we perform this

288
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,560
swapping random shot from uh

289
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,800
n times so each number has to be

290
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,000
picked for swap

291
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,240
once

292
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,240
right if it is if it's not thick it

293
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,440
means it's unfired if it takes more than

294
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,560
once it's

295
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,279
oh sorry it's if it's picked

296
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,200
mono once it's it's buyers

297
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,200
if it's pick

298
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,760
less than once it means it's not picked

299
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,560
at all it's by yourself as well right

300
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,720
yeah i'm not you still with me

301
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,880
do you get what i'm saying yeah

302
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,040
okay yeah okay

303
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,959
okay so

304
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,519
what's your approach if i want to

305
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,519
perform end time swapping what's your

306
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,760
approach

307
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,240
in order to be

308
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,800
to give up unbiased

309
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,200
swapping for each element

310
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,120
any idea

311
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,600
so the problem of this one is that when

312
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,760
this element is swapped

313
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
it could be swapped back using this

314
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,519
approach right we don't want it to swap

315
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,360
back now one way of fixing it is what

316
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,399
it's like okay i have one

317
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,079
okay look i have four four numbers

318
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,720
i put it in a hat

319
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,240
i run an empirical number ah i want to

320
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,000
swap it right

321
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,760
so it's swap so it has to be moved here

322
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,959
i this is this is already determined

323
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,480
right pull pull off the numbers and now

324
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,000
i want to pick another number for

325
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
swapping

326
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,800
which which

327
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,399
which

328
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,839
three numbers i need to pick okay i

329
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,680
already keep saying three numbers i

330
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,680
randomly pick one number after this

331
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,360
right and that's okay

332
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,519
and again i randomly pick one over

333
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,120
obviously so the numbers when i pick

334
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,360
already

335
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,839
are not for pick in the future right the

336
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,800
previous approach is back then okay i i

337
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,880
picked

338
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,560
i don't even pick one numbers i swap it

339
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,720
i put it back and now again when you

340
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,320
pick three numbers four one number of

341
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
these four and i'll empty this one so

342
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,839
one number could be picked more than

343
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,040
once right so we want to solve this

344
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,279
problem by by using these two to place

345
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,519
this once it's clicked it moves to that

346
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,680
and we don't pick it again right that's

347
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,200
that will give this unbiased

348
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,600
uh

349
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,839
when uh shuffling right got it make

350
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
sense

351
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,320
yeah

352
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,760
do you think

353
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,760
do you see the problem we're trying to

354
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,440
solve yeah the shuffling it gives the

355
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,800
random permutation

356
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,040
and we want to

357
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,079
be i'm biased it means that each number

358
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,160
if we

359
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,760
do the swapping for n times each number

360
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,839
has to be picked exactly

361
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,959
yeah once

362
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,880
yeah

363
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,639
make sense

364
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,519
okay so then we can implement this yeah

365
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,680
we can implement this

366
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,279
so you the implementation could be just

367
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,000
very simple but you have to understand

368
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,839
the

369
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,920
the principle which is like you know you

370
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,360
can remember this half i think when you

371
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,800
pick the number we'll move it here we're

372
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,800
going to pick one number here over here

373
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,959
okay let's define shuffling

374
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,120
shuffling

375
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,440
numbers

376
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,440
right

377
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,399
now for

378
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
i

379
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,440
in

380
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,399
range

381
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,720
length

382
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,880
numbers

383
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:18,959
so we also repeat this enzyme look this

384
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,959
is one two three four here and right

385
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:26,399
so let's divide these in into half the

386
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,880
left part is already shuffled the right

387
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,600
part is still in the head yeah still in

388
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,440
the head okay

389
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,600
make sense remember the thing is the

390
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,040
thing i talked about here

391
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,880
yeah

392
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,360
the left this is the left

393
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,760
at least it's still in the head okay

394
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,279
stay in the head okay

395
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,440
sense

396
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,199
so i first of all i will generate the

397
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,639
index so for i

398
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,560
x will be

399
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,279
rent range right render range

400
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,360
red range lens num

401
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,160
uh

402
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,639
so we want to generally start from the i

403
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,120
start from i we want to swap this we

404
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,480
don't start from i i need not pick one

405
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,360
numbers

406
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,399
from here to the right right i

407
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,399
to the lens number

408
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,000
yeah

409
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,199
and then what should we do we just need

410
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,279
to swap it

411
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,440
now

412
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,880
i how do we solve two numbers by the way

413
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,480
how do we solve two numbers by the way

414
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,320
come on this is an easy question for you

415
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,720
how do we solve two numbers if a b how

416
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,360
do we solve a b a b

417
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,600
a wow any for you this is the python way

418
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,880
of doing and how about if we don't

419
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,759
copy

420
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,440
uh

421
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,199
no no how about if i

422
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,639
how about if we want to use the third

423
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,639
variable to do it how do we do this

424
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,360
not deep copy what i'm saying is that i

425
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,560
i won't swap value between a and b how

426
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,399
do we

427
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,279
um

428
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,160
how do we swap it with the half of the

429
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,160
third parameter

430
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:11,920
look you say a b equals b a f but

431
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,920
ideally what's behind is t equals a

432
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,320
a equals b

433
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,880
yeah yeah a value to copy a

434
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,040
yeah that's d copy right

435
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,000
oh wait that yes it's still copied yeah

436
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,720
because

437
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,279
yeah but what i mean is more specific t

438
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,839
equals a a b and then what what's the

439
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,639
third one uh

440
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,160
b

441
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,360
equal

442
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,440
yeah

443
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,279
if we said b equals a that would not

444
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,000
work right because a is already changed

445
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,480
to b okay make sense

446
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,920
yeah okay so this

447
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,800
uh nums i norms x

448
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,759
equals nums

449
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,360
x

450
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,920
nums

451
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,440
i okay now we're stopping the index at i

452
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,759
and x right

453
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,320
yeah first of all we generate index from

454
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,320
i to the to the end

455
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,079
so here we are i here

456
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,919
we first of all generate index

457
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,880
adjustment why because they're still in

458
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,120
the head

459
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,000
and we're swapping with the i right

460
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,000
so people is that

461
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,039
so so we don't touch the elements before

462
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,240
i because it's already it's already

463
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,919
picked

464
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,439
all right yeah make sense

465
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,240
and next time we move it because we

466
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,439
already have one already swap one more

467
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,320
element

468
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,480
so it becomes in uh in this

469
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,440
this is before i index smaller than i

470
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,240
right

471
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,600
in the smaller so let's let's see

472
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,280
shuffling look easy yeah for i in ranger

473
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,200
learn the range

474
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,880
yeah make sense

475
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,640
make sense any questions so far

476
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,720
okay so one one simple question what's

477
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,360
the probability of

478
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
swapping

479
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,720
swapping uh n elements

480
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,120
uh no

481
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,360
what's the what's the

482
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,760
random shuffling probability of each

483
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,840
permit of each permutation

484
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,360
if the n

485
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,799
if the end

486
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,400
items

487
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,120
how many how many ways of full

488
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,880
permutation of permutation of it

489
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,280
i just said at the beginning if not any

490
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,280
items

491
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:28,360
three items how many ways of doing it

492
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,360
okay so an item how many was doing

493
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,520
each one has the

494
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,600
if it's unbiased what's the probability

495
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:42,000
of each permutation

496
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,640
if it's unbiased what's the population

497
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,640
yeah easy yeah that's

498
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,640
that's simple max right simple mess

499
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,720
do you understand this part

500
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,720
do you understand

501
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,080
so we are separating this array into two

502
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,799
halves one

503
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,320
is

504
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,799
this bit

505
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,280
the right hand side is still in the half

506
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,440
it's the numbers we are not picking yet

507
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,559
so every time we generate a number at

508
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,559
this range

509
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,600
we want to pick a number at this range

510
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,320
and we swap it with the current one

511
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,640
and then we move it so this number is is

512
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,039
determined okay

513
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,720
why we won't do it because each number

514
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:29,520
is only swap once yeah once it's swapped

515
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,880
it becomes on the left side

516
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,520
look at me it becomes a left side so

517
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,360
can we say this if the number is swapped

518
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,000
only once

519
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,320
if a number is not only once

520
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,960
and if we perform n

521
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,880
because we are performing n times

522
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,200
right there are n numbers we're

523
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,559
performing n times each each number is

524
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,520
up only once so what does it mean

525
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,799
every number gets the equal prop uh

526
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,559
probability of being each location right

527
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,080
right so there are numbers i have n

528
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,559
slots

529
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,480
okay so n stops

530
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,080
uh listen carefully okay there and there

531
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,559
are n slots

532
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,400
and numbers one to n each number is

533
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,799
being swapped once

534
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,840
and if we swap n times

535
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,159
right

536
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,760
so it means that it means what it means

537
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,760
that each slot each is each number at

538
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,960
each slot right is

539
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,080
it

540
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,280
is what it has this equal probability

541
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,520
right

542
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,600
all right

543
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,799
so it's unbiased it's unbiased

544
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,840
we want the unbiased each number

545
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,679
each number is should be on

546
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,880
each slot

547
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,960
right

548
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,960
we don't want a buyer's one we don't

549
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,520
want to say okay okay we want one

550
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,360
in this slot because we just like it

551
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,520
we can't say that right

552
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,360
it needs to be equally equally

553
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,280
distributed right

554
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,919
if i say okay they are more likely this

555
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,360
chance chance of one in first location

556
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,080
is fifty percent

557
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,320
on all others is fifty percent that's

558
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,679
bad that's bad shuffling

559
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,760
when you should play the render

560
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,520
shuffling car do you want

561
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,080
the top of the car

562
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,720
to be more likely like you know some i

563
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,240
don't know yeah your favorite right

564
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,240
then that's bad right because people

565
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,600
think okay people could guess

566
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,080
all right do you see what i'm saying

567
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,880
if it's randomly shuffling it means that

568
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,200
the top of the car could be anything

569
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,280
if that anchor the top of the the first

570
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,159
position of the uh

571
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,320
of the

572
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,000
sequence random shuffling sequence could

573
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,799
be anything right so we can't guess

574
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,799
because it could be

575
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,760
yeah yeah yeah so yeah

576
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,360
even if people can catch the random

577
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,280
shuffling of uh you know the more likely

578
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,360
then then there's no point of shuffling

579
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,039
yeah right the point of shuffling is

580
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,520
make it

581
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,320
non-guessable right

582
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,799
yeah

583
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,799
so it it could be anything right because

584
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,320
each of each

585
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,679
its permutation is unbiased

586
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,960
it's equally

587
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:18,159
uh distributed so you can't make a guess

588
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,280
there's no more likely or less likely

589
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,360
okay

590
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,360
okay so i i feel like i talked a lot

591
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,000
today but the point is you understand

592
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,520
yeah you understand yes okay good job

593
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,520
that's for today you can do something

594
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,679
bye bye

595
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,559
okay

596
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,480
hey

597
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,359
okay that's it that's it for today

598
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,359
