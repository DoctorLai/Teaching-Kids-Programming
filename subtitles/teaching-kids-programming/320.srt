1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
go

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,040
hello

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,879
so we have a you know the computer we

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,639
have keyboards yeah we have this control

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,080
c okay

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,519
ctrl c yeah okay so what's that ctrl c a

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,960
copy copy copy where

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,880
copy what and then ctrl v

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,199
paste it we want to paste why wouldn't

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,199
control p

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,320
that's a good question control p is for

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,160
print very very good question okay

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,800
control plus p is usually print you know

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,680
ctrl v i don't know why is it called v

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,320
but it's actually paste control

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,600
so when we control c so if we have a

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,160
test like eric and ryan yeah

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,760
if we select you know we select we stand

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,600
the text

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,399
press ctrl c

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,520
and

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,440
the selected text or image or file

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,359
whatever you selected

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,879
is paste is it store one copy in a clip

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,640
clipboard

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,519
clipboard

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
paper okay so in the buffer we have this

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,640
error right

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,600
okay

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,520
and then i control v again and then

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,280
we will have it

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,119
right here and if i keep practicing

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,560
you'll have multiple copies of that

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,000
right okay let's just control

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,680
sequentially

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,799
okay make sense

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,000
that's it

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,400
so today we there's a very simple uh you

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,079
know very interesting math problem so if

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
we have a keyboard right if we have a

41
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,560
keyboard like can you go back if we have

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,920
a keyboard like only have one character

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,400
which is a

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,240
right if we have a unless

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,920
at the beginning there's only one a in

46
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,240
the screen

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,560
so for each operation you can

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,520
do this you can select

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,880
you can

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,479
control

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,680
control c

52
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,040
or

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,159
current a's or a's yeah in a screen

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,640
or you can control v

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,280
control v to paste whatever in the

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
buffer yeah paste paste whatever you

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
copied last time

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,280
right so let's give an example we want

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,080
to find out the minimum number operation

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,959
to get the number uh to get n a for

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,959
example if i want to have a

62
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,640
sorry if i want to have

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,319
two a's

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,400
how can we do it so at the beginning we

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,440
only have one egg how can we make using

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,319
these two operations to make two days

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,879
come on quite easy yeah

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,120
a control c you have to start with one

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,959
name control c yeah yeah it's easier

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,040
control c and control v where done

71
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,720
because control c you copy this a and

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,599
then console v you put an a in there

73
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,120
right

74
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,040
okay how about

75
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,360
if it's only one a do we need to do

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,800
anything else no no because there's only

77
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,680
one okay so for that one a input one a

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:56,080
we need a zero operation two a's we need

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,080
a two because copy and paste three a's

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,080
you need

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,120
three three

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,120
copy

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,879
paste paste right

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,680
copy paste place three

85
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,239
four eight three

86
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,640
three or four come on easy three

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,480
three four three

88
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,800
minimum the better you say four you said

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,800
three

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,440
oh

91
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,760
yeah

92
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,879
that's the thing look so first of all

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,720
so first of all you copy you copy one a

94
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,959
yeah yeah you paste it

95
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,239
two a's twice

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,480
then you copy again oh copy again and

97
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,720
then paste it again so that's that's

98
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,519
four right is the four yeah yeah

99
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,840
okay so it's the same thing as copy

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,239
paste paste paste right

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,879
it's full copy paste space paste so you

102
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,959
can have copy face paste space or you

103
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,120
can have copy

104
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,480
paste paste copy paste paste copy paste

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,319
all fours yes

106
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,560
okay

107
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,799
five okay a a

108
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,799
a

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,199
can we do better no

110
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,440
there's no other way right

111
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,600
because it's five right it's fine

112
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,560
fine okay this is comes with interesting

113
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:43,720
ones six you will have six

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,720
how can we do this one two copy

115
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
copy

116
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,680
copy

117
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,440
paste

118
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,639
and then copy

119
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,400
paste paste

120
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,520
right all you can do is copy paste

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,560
paste

122
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,479
copy

123
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,880
paste right which one is cluster copy

124
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,880
copy

125
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,039
paste

126
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,000
paste

127
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,199
copy

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,240
paste yeah you see or

129
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,160
copy

130
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,800
paste paste

131
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,840
paste paste space space

132
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,840
or copy

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
paste

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,120
copy

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,080
paste

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,919
paste

137
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,880
okay seems fine yeah it seems fine yeah

138
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,400
you see

139
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,199
did you get it yeah so that goes on yeah

140
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
yeah

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,320
all right

142
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,919
so we can do this profile so yeah of

143
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,440
course we can try because for each

144
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,000
operation we can keep trying for each

145
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,000
one we can say it's copy or paste we can

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,720
keep trying this until we get it but

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,320
this is quite uh quite slow right

148
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
because there are lots of possibilities

149
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,240
for each operation there are two right

150
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,319
we can for each one we can say we can

151
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,919
choose copy or we can choose space why

152
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,240
does it need to be a

153
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,000
sorry why are there any a is there's

154
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,440
only one characters well why does it

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
have to be a

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,360
oh it could be b b whatever then the

157
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,080
point is that we need n we need these

158
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,280
two operations to come up with n exactly

159
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,120
n

160
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,120
times

161
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,160
a okay or whatever letter you choose

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:29,199
okay so this problem is quite clear okay

163
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,199
so how can what how can we minimize this

164
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,919
one how do we minimize this

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,600
so look if i have

166
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,680
look look if i have nine a's

167
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,840
so what's how do we quickly come up with

168
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,919
9 8

169
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,680
if we have three characters three a's in

170
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,039
the buffer we can press copy paste paste

171
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,639
three times right yeah all right okay so

172
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:58,639
another example if i have uh

173
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,639
if i have 99 a's

174
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,479
one obvious way you can copy one and

175
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,440
press paste 98 times right

176
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,199
yeah

177
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,240
that's that's obviously you can for n a

178
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,520
if n bigger than or e bigger than one

179
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,560
then that's the most the slowest method

180
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,639
you can say is end and anyway exactly

181
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,240
because you copy one a and you press

182
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,080
press

183
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,479
and minus one time right

184
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
yeah hold it so what's about me holding

185
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,199
it

186
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,960
hold it yeah yeah hold it

187
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,759
you get it right 1998 one slowest way i

188
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,919
can think of is i copy one a because i

189
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,520
already have one a right i copy one a

190
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,080
that takes one time

191
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,080
and i put press paste 80 98 times right

192
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,800
yeah

193
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:54,160
right or i can i can do what i can copy

194
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,800
i can copy three uh i can copy one

195
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,680
i can copy three a's

196
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,360
right

197
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,440
copy paste paste

198
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,400
and i copy these

199
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,080
yeah then i have three a's and i press

200
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,199
32 times

201
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,199
right

202
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,120
like make sense because each time i

203
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,639
press ctrl v

204
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,000
that would be 3 8 am right

205
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,080
makes sense

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
makes sense so obviously this is quicker

207
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,160
because look copy

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,400
paste paste

209
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,240
copy paste paste and copy

210
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,000
four times and then i need to press how

211
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,800
many of v

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,320
32 times right 32 times 30 times of v so

213
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,599
all together that will be 34 32 plus 4

214
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,440
36

215
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,279
which is less than

216
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,399
99 we're talking about right

217
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:48,320
99 we're talking about okay

218
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:52,399
make sense right yeah it was

219
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:56,399
98 because you need to chris knight

220
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:59,680
19 i want the 99 99 a right

221
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,240
i want to 99 8 so now i have uh

222
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,560
oh yeah you are right 32

223
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,959
because all together is 33 nine

224
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,120
33 times of a and i already have three

225
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,480
a's so i need to press another 32 times

226
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,440
to cut paste three a's 32 times right

227
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,279
okay

228
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,480
okay so this is interesting yeah because

229
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,480
we look if so we can

230
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
as we talk about the blue force is too

231
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
slow yeah we're not going to do the full

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,800
first thing here because it's so slow

233
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,240
right

234
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,440
so how about if i have an s function

235
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
a function f n

236
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,120
yeah

237
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,839
if n if i if it's you know if it's the

238
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,920
number the minimum number of uh

239
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,920
if it's the minimum number operations to

240
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,440
get n right

241
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,920
and i can send them it's equals to mean

242
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,680
mean of what medium

243
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,800
because i want to try

244
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,200
try to try all possibilities try all the

245
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,160
factors yeah factors

246
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,000
fine

247
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,480
like for example like 10 what's the

248
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,760
factor of 10

249
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,200
2

250
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,839
five right i want to try two and five

251
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,279
right because if f2 can be

252
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,920
if f2

253
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,600
yeah i can i can copy i can copy the f2

254
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,720
two characters in the buffer and i can

255
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,279
play page five times or i can copy five

256
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,920
characters into the buffer and press the

257
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,000
ctrl v two times right and i want to

258
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,480
compare the minimum of these

259
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,320
right i want to compare minimum please

260
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,800
make sense

261
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,640
[Music]

262
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,200
it doesn't make sense yeah it makes

263
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,880
sense yeah how about 20

264
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,399
what's the factor of 20

265
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,200
20 keys what's the fact that 2

266
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,079
4

267
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,120
5

268
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,120
5

269
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,200
10 yeah up to half right so now

270
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,519
now if this is f another function and i

271
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,279
can i can see if this is from another

272
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,399
sub problem right sub problem then i can

273
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,279
say okay

274
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,920
if i have i know the answer of

275
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,760
if this is a time this is b times this c

276
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,120
times this c times and then the minimum

277
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,360
will be what

278
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,160
means

279
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,600
a

280
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,079
plus

281
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,000
20 and two divided by two right it needs

282
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,480
another ten times right

283
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,600
all right place ten times right

284
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,000
and then mean and then what b

285
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,680
plus how many twenty divided by four

286
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,800
five times

287
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,279
c

288
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,839
twenty c plus twenty divided by five

289
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,040
four times

290
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,720
ten 20 divided by 10 to plus d to the

291
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,240
potential right so i want to get these

292
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,519
four numbers and

293
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,880
get the minimum

294
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,600
what's this up what's this kind of thing

295
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,480
well we talked about the thingy you know

296
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,040
what's this we talk about the thingy

297
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,040
what's this

298
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,120
yeah dynamic programming we have two

299
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,240
ways of doing it which is what

300
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,839
what

301
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,079
yeah the fibonacci number remember

302
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,360
yeah number

303
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,399
yeah

304
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,120
all right

305
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:05,279
uh fibonacci number yeah

306
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:08,399
ff f7 equals f6 plus f5

307
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,880
s6 plus equals f5 plus f4

308
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,320
okay about it yeah typical nice number

309
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,320
if you're going this way that will be

310
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,519
top down if you're going that way

311
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,560
starting from f1 s2

312
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,440
to fn that's butter up right

313
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,760
it's going this way uh that would be

314
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,000
when using the top down right make sense

315
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,000
right

316
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,120
so let's quickly implement uh top down

317
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,880
okay because top down gives the most

318
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,920
intuitive way of solving this problem

319
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
okay

320
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,160
define

321
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,880
n

322
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,720
obviously if n smaller or equals one

323
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,639
then we return zero right because we

324
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,160
already have one characters

325
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,680
yeah we don't need to continue right

326
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,639
there's only one characters then that's

327
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,880
it

328
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,639
now let's say answer equals what let's

329
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,320
say what's the slowness remember we

330
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,279
talked about the slowest way to come up

331
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,079
with n character what's the slowest way

332
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,079
how many answer equals one

333
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,760
what's your opinion

334
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:09,000
the very big number or what

335
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,000
[Music]

336
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,800
right we talk about this is the slowest

337
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,839
way right if left and a

338
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,800
i can copy one a and press nine times

339
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:26,000
place place nine times right so one plus

340
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,240
nine equals ten right this is zero yeah

341
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,839
and then i fall i

342
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,720
in range

343
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,680
i start with the second yeah and up two

344
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,880
and divided by 2 plus 1 yeah because up

345
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,639
to n divided by 2 and we give a plus 1

346
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,880
because this gives the inclusive this

347
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,720
number is increasing and divided by 2.

348
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
so now if

349
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,839
n

350
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,639
modulus i equal equals zero right look

351
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,079
look look i want to get the f10

352
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,880
all right f10 and then i fi

353
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:03,199
so what's the factor this is together

354
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,600
factor yeah two five right yeah

355
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,680
i know what should we do answer

356
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,680
equals mean

357
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,199
answer

358
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,279
and so what look

359
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,680
f

360
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,279
f what f i

361
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,720
f y y come on plus what

362
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,959
what

363
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,959
x y plus one

364
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,279
x y plus one come on think about it

365
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,399
what's the f5 f5 as well

366
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,399
and then return obviously

367
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,639
f2

368
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,320
plus one plus one five times yeah so now

369
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,880
what's b i

370
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,240
i is two so what's what's this

371
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,920
and

372
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,760
divided by

373
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,399
i right because you need that term right

374
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,199
look n is ten i is two twenty divided by

375
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,160
five

376
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,399
all right

377
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,959
yeah all right

378
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,680
one thing is missing if i don't put that

379
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,720
cash well done yeah because look this is

380
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,639
expand you know exponentially

381
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,880
you need to put a cash to remember the

382
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,720
fn because we don't want to repeatedly

383
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,199
take away fl right this is the same

384
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,880
thing as the fibonacci number right

385
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,279
yeah

386
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,399
top down top down and actually what's

387
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,399
the time complexity if it is

388
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,480
[Music]

389
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,000
don't worry about the complexity

390
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,279
remember the square

391
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,519
yeah yeah yeah

392
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,759
we can always verify the the tom come

393
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,519
next using butter up okay let's try the

394
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,519
butter

395
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,519
up

396
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,059
[Music]

397
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,040
let's say i convert it to

398
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,040
range range and plus one yeah because we

399
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,399
want to return

400
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,160
everything ryan can i have your

401
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,720
attention from the last time please let

402
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,720
me go backstage

403
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:18,000
[Music]

404
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,399
return dp this is the value i want to

405
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,399
store the number uh to store the value

406
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,199
so which which value should i return

407
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,199
okay right

408
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,120
dp which value dpi stores the number of

409
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,120
uh

410
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,830
stores of the answer for so what's the

411
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,320
dptpu

412
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,399
[Music]

413
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,120
and yeah dp and the last value of tp

414
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,959
minus one yeah this is the same

415
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,759
so now look i have what i have uh four

416
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,079
i

417
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,759
in range

418
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,600
i start from the second yeah because i

419
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,519
already know the first one and then up

420
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,680
to m plus one

421
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,800
and i can start from another for loop

422
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,720
for j

423
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:02,600
in range

424
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,600
start from the two i up to i plus one

425
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,679
well i divided by 2 plus 1

426
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,480
right

427
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:18,199
and then now we can try if

428
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,199
if i modulus j equal equal 0 right

429
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,000
dp

430
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,919
i equals mean of dpi okay so tell me

431
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,760
what's right here it's quite similar dpi

432
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,720
what

433
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,720
what if i found j is the one of the

434
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,919
factor of i

435
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,640
and dpi is the number the minimum number

436
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,160
of operations to come up with i

437
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,919
a's yeah

438
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,559
ias

439
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,160
so what's the value of dpi we want to

440
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,120
get the minimum all right you just you

441
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,480
was just saying if that 10 10 if i found

442
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,080
the 10

443
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,400
and then i is two and what's the value

444
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,559
dpi because um two and five are more

445
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,840
closer to each other and one on ten is

446
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,000
more

447
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,440
okay that's a very interesting point but

448
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,520
look here i have i call i a yeah i want

449
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,640
to come up with i

450
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,240
i want to come up with i and i know j

451
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,640
j yeah is the one of the factor of i so

452
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,640
it equals what dp j

453
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,080
plus 1 plus 1

454
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,600
plus 1 i

455
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,880
plus 1 i

456
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,320
look dpi plus i y

457
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,720
i need to divide

458
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,320
divided by because j time man i have

459
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,320
already i i i already have j

460
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,000
i already have j in the clipboard in a

461
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,880
buffer and i need to press how many

462
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,120
times i divided by j times right i have

463
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,600
two in the buffer i have two in the

464
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,080
buffer right so i have to have to place

465
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,240
five times yeah four times yeah because

466
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,160
i have to copy one and uh press four

467
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,880
times so it's one plus four equals five

468
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,799
right

469
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,400
all right

470
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,919
repeating zero okay so what's the time

471
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,320
complexity if you're looking this this

472
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,320
is quite obvious alright

473
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,760
everyone come on what's the

474
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,919
what's the time conversation if you look

475
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,799
at this

476
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,799
come on hurry up

477
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,480
why is the one square can you tell me

478
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,239
[Music]

479
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,240
so remember the previous one

480
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,480
top down here

481
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,760
there is only one four but inside the

482
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,200
four you need to do cushion two

483
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,520
different cushions to get the other

484
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,200
values so this is actually another four

485
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,760
right so it's actually the same o n

486
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,760
square and this one this one is bottom

487
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,760
right which one you think is better

488
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,799
which one is this one this one this one

489
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,880
because there's no recursion right

490
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,640
there's no recursion and you can just

491
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,760
implement but this needs to

492
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,520
you need to do it the in a reverse order

493
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,600
from the bottom to the up right and you

494
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,799
need to create we need to create an dp

495
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,400
array yeah dpi dpi at the beginning

496
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,240
equals i right because they have the

497
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,799
slope right

498
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,039
all right yeah okay so there are 10 a's

499
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,280
what's the what's the number of uh ways

500
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,720
you can do it okay if i want to have 10

501
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,679
8 come on one last question

502
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,120
how can we do it

503
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,640
how can we do it

504
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,000
come on think about it give me answer

505
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:33,720
let me let me check what's the 10 a yeah

506
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,720
how many how many

507
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,720
five

508
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,640
two five six six six six i'll turn it to

509
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,080
the sixth one

510
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,720
