1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:05,640
all right

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,200
how would you put the data on a piece of

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,880
paper for example like you want to tell

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,040
your friends all right what's your name

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,059
what's your age how would you write on a

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,799
piece of paper

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,120
I didn't want to send your you know too

8
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,859
late in the envelope

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,600
and then you want to give it to other

10
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,220
people and then tell your name your age

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,080
how would you write it I mean suppose

12
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,340
this is a piece of paper

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,680
I know how to write it this someone

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,539
so you write a sentence right can you

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,880
find out the simplest way just to tell

16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,280
to let a lot of people know what you

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,500
want to say

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,500
yeah okay are you writing a sentence

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,360
okay I see okay so right and you're

20
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,460
writing like numbers by eight right and

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,500
then put them here right okay so let's

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,820
uh color mark

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,180
yeah okay

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,360
good okay so you yeah

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,280
okay so anyway okay so y'all the idea is

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,079
the writing a sentence all right all

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,260
right obviously writing a sentence that

28
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,840
people can understand it all right and

29
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,880
why your idea is to write the keywords

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,820
right and people can understand right

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,220
yes the bills are okay these are both

32
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,380
humans right so the idea is that we want

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,740
to come up with the data it's

34
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,380
interchange format so the easier for

35
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,619
humans and for computer to understand

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,020
so we want to exchange this data for

37
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,040
example like the name the age and I will

38
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,040
come up with something like this

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,600
Eric for example

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,820
age

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,820
10.

42
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,560
okay look suppose this format it's easy

43
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,740
to understand right because that sounds

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,960
familiar the key is very impaired it's a

45
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,820
lightweight

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,619
lightweight

47
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:58,740
data interchange

48
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:02,280
in the change format and that's uh easy

49
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,040
for computers and also for humans to

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,439
understand the computers we have an

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,000
efficient argument to pass this string

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,920
the text format this is a simple text

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,319
and this is quite similar to the

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,060
dictionary in Python so that's the

55
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,099
format that we are going to talk shortly

56
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,379
this is called Json

57
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,459
it's very popular it's a format text

58
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:26,160
format that we used usually to store and

59
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,080
transfer the data between the client and

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,920
the server so for example the computer

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,480
here right in the browser have you seen

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,459
the login window

63
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,760
can lock in window

64
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:41,580
the username the password

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,760
and there's a locking button right

66
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,260
okay so when you follow Eric yeah

67
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,540
and the password one two three four

68
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,000
obviously this needs to be encrypted all

69
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,959
right and then you click login what

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,840
happened

71
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,360
your computer you need a browser we send

72
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,400
a request to the server server in the

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,720
cloud right what's Cloud remember lots

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,720
of computers

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,420
somewhere right for example the cloud

76
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,060
the computer may be in London how does

77
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,099
this data exchange so you could be in

78
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,540
this Json format Json is one of the top

79
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:16,680
species right so you could be

80
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,739
constructing a format named Eric age 10.

81
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,180
and then the cloud takes it and then

82
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,519
you'll be able to external information

83
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,500
the name and the age

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,019
and the password okay we are talking

85
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,500
about the password Here okay so this is

86
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:34,319
the thing data in the change format so

87
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,800
so in Python we can use this import

88
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,300
Json and now we can say Json

89
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,099
stop

90
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,220
loads

91
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:46,200
we can load uh

92
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,360
adjacent format

93
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,159
parsley and store it into the variable

94
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,480
all we can do this opposite which is

95
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,060
thumbs

96
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,940
you can thumb the variable and into a

97
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,580
Json format string Json contains the

98
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,159
object or array there are two

99
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,720
possibilities one you know one is this

100
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,819
curly brace

101
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,780
with the key value pairs right each

102
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,959
value

103
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,200
could be another object or array so it

104
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,420
could be nasty so you can have them you

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,459
know like Alias something that I left

106
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,160
right and the keys

107
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,199
codified double coat right double quotes

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,000
only but in Python you can do it in

109
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,759
Singapore but Jason the standard Jason

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,400
format the keys should be coated in

111
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:33,000
double code the values could be array

112
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,979
the numbers right okay

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,259
and then array okay so we talk about the

114
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:40,500
array in Python what what's the array

115
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:43,500
using this one two this is array right

116
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,639
so this is a validation and this we can

117
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,840
say

118
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,840
uh numbers

119
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:55,259
five one two three this is a Json right

120
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,139
and uh foo foo and then you can have

121
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,120
another object and then we have another

122
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:05,400
bar

123
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:09,780
uh array one two or four bar what's

124
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,620
what's next p t t Okay and then it'll be

125
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:16,860
values some one two three

126
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,880
okay so you see the curly brace comes in

127
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,340
pairs

128
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,039
right the arrays

129
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,740
this is like this that we will define an

130
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,620
array in Python the numbers

131
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,380
so the numbers the values we can have

132
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,880
the numbers one two three we can have a

133
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,060
value string

134
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,340
string hello why

135
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,460
clothing in double quotes or we can have

136
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,840
a three special uh constant value which

137
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,400
is true

138
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,680
fourth

139
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,300
and noon what's new what's the reason

140
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,740
what I mean noon what do you mean

141
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,720
nothing nothing noon 2013 values

142
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,979
one thing about Jason is that we don't

143
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
have comments

144
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:00,060
what comment

145
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,440
when you write the python code you start

146
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,660
with a hashtag

147
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,940
and everything after the computer will

148
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,380
just ignore it that's for humans you can

149
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:13,380
say okay Eric is amazing okay and then

150
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,479
computer what is this sharp sun and we

151
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,419
ignore it it's not part of the code but

152
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:20,820
in in Json you can't have comments

153
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,979
everything is data all right everything

154
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,280
is data so you can have something that I

155
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:28,699
like why look so send the Json for my

156
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,699
only store

157
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,139
array okay but some other standards

158
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,780
allow the you know just storing the

159
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,400
values difference

160
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,740
okay

161
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,960
Okay so

162
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,600
today what's Jason and can you both

163
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,800
write a simple Json here the easy

164
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,960
situation

165
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,020
and that's it what's Jason

166
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,840
can you write an example of Json

167
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,180
just test your knowledge that's it Ryan

168
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,340
you want to have a go

169
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,560
simple Jason remember one day I talked

170
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,520
about the Jason

171
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,520
just simple Jason

172
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,560
[Music]

173
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,780
yeah okay so what's Jason what can you

174
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,300
write this thing for this Jason

175
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,099
you can do it very simple and that's it

176
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,080
you know what did I talk about the

177
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:24,120
objects and the way what's the simple

178
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,979
what's the empty object what's the empty

179
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,500
array how do you declare an object

180
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:30,660
dictionary in Python how do you declare

181
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,120
empty arrays in person

182
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,919
what's the key value pairing number you

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,539
start with the double chord and then

184
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,539
what a string can be a validation

185
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,300
what what do you want to write anything

186
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,539
Ryan name

187
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,539
okay

188
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,560
okay Karma okay but if this is the key

189
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,560
you have to do this with the you're

190
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,240
missing one this curly braids okay and

191
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,860
then calibrates to end it and you can

192
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,940
add add more

193
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:18,419
this is Jason this is not okay

194
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:21,360
remember Jason this is Jason this is the

195
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:25,979
Jason this is a Jason all these one two

196
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:29,580
three situation or two or two four

197
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:32,660
or noon right yeah so can you write a

198
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,660
pick one yeah

199
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,539
just speak organized

200
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,300
what's what's this how do you improve

201
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,300
this in computer

202
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,279
um there's no such thing as least what's

203
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,279
this

204
00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:00,740
age is a number right okay then

205
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,640
is that how we store

206
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,240
and transform the data format right like

207
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,920
like at the beginning said you want to

208
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,560
tell the name column

209
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,019
by an age per say something like that

210
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,240
and people can understand right because

211
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,279
it seems if it simply give the values

212
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,500
people may not understand what it is am

213
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,240
I right if you buy a 9 on a piece of

214
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,980
paper give it to Eric

215
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,440
I really may not understand what the

216
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,260
night meaning is you have to put the age

217
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,680
before it am I so this is for computer

218
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:38,459
to understand your data this is the Json

219
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:42,680
structure array string values numbers

220
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:42,680
and this is three special meanings

221
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,740
their calibrations for object this is

222
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,440
the keys this is very it's like a

223
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,180
dictionary in Python right in Python how

224
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,100
do you declare additionally

225
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,399
how did you get additional you just do

226
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,500
this right like uh you just do this a

227
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,180
equals this is the dictionary and we

228
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,240
talk about the partition right it's the

229
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,980
same thing the only thing that is so

230
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,339
special about this is the adjacent

231
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,200
format the keys has to be encoded with

232
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,200
double quotes but in Python you don't

233
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,140
have to uh stick to the double so it

234
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,140
could be a single chord right Jason what

235
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,800
does this stand for JavaScript object

236
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,120
notation okay JavaScript

237
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,180
this is another programming language you

238
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:37,800
just know it's a problem JavaScript

239
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:39,540
object notation huh okay okay so what

240
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,279
have you learned today that's it

241
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,360
you're letting the Jason from what is

242
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,360
this that's one sentence

243
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,959
information yeah for sending information

244
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,640
uh to a computer yeah for for computer

245
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,519
to store

246
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,220
and transfer the data and this format is

247
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,480
also easy to understand for humans all

248
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,079
right yeah

249
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,079
okay

250
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,100
what's that post

251
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,120
I left it for today bye-bye
