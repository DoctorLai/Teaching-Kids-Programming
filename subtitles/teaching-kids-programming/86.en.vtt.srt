hello mr eric mr ryan how are you today

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,160
hello mr eric mr ryan how are you today
 

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,349
hello mr eric mr ryan how are you today
good good good yeah so today we talk

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:07,359
good good good yeah so today we talk
 

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,430
good good good yeah so today we talk
about binary trees

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
about binary trees
 

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,070
about binary trees
binary trees okay can you tell me what

8
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
binary trees okay can you tell me what
 

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,830
binary trees okay can you tell me what
is the binary tree area

10
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:13,840
is the binary tree area
 

11
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,029
is the binary tree area
is it is the tree with the number

12
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
is it is the tree with the number
 

13
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,269
is it is the tree with the number
okay every time last time i ask you and

14
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
okay every time last time i ask you and
 

15
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,630
okay every time last time i ask you and
you say the same thing can you

16
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,640
you say the same thing can you
 

17
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,710
you say the same thing can you
stand up can you write write the binary

18
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
stand up can you write write the binary
 

19
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,830
stand up can you write write the binary
tree ryan doing to draw a minority

20
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
tree ryan doing to draw a minority
 

21
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,830
tree ryan doing to draw a minority
okay that's fine draw a banana tree

22
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
okay that's fine draw a banana tree
 

23
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:36,630
okay that's fine draw a banana tree
please

24
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640

 

25
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:47,029

come on it's not drawing lessons come on

26
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039

 

27
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,790

no no it doesn't it's a final tree it

28
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
no no it doesn't it's a final tree it
 

29
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,950
no no it doesn't it's a final tree it
doesn't have to be a final research tree

30
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
doesn't have to be a final research tree
 

31
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,350
doesn't have to be a final research tree
yeah

32
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
yeah
 

33
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,950
yeah
it's a binary tree okay so look

34
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
it's a binary tree okay so look
 

35
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,110
it's a binary tree okay so look
the the maximum pass between the loop

36
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
the the maximum pass between the loop
 

37
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,670
the the maximum pass between the loop
this is the root to the leaf is what

38
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
this is the root to the leaf is what
 

39
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,470
this is the root to the leaf is what
10 to two notes yeah yeah so this is

40
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:02,480
10 to two notes yeah yeah so this is
 

41
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,590
10 to two notes yeah yeah so this is
which is very smooth

42
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
which is very smooth
 

43
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,469
which is very smooth
so this is we if we call it the maximum

44
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
so this is we if we call it the maximum
 

45
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,030
so this is we if we call it the maximum
depth

46
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
depth
 

47
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,270
depth
is also equal to maximum pass

48
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
is also equal to maximum pass
 

49
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,350
is also equal to maximum pass
maximum pass between the root

50
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
maximum pass between the root
 

51
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,630
maximum pass between the root
and the length

52
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
and the length
 

53
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,070
and the length
okay so so

54
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
okay so so
 

55
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,990
okay so so
um so look what's this if i add one more

56
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
um so look what's this if i add one more
 

57
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,109
um so look what's this if i add one more
two more what's the two threes that's

58
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
two more what's the two threes that's
 

59
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,149
two more what's the two threes that's
right so what's the

60
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
right so what's the
 

61
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,270
right so what's the
maximum term maximum pass

62
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
maximum term maximum pass
 

63
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,390
maximum term maximum pass
four one two three four yeah

64
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
four one two three four yeah
 

65
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,109
four one two three four yeah
we're done so how can we do how can we

66
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
we're done so how can we do how can we
 

67
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,390
we're done so how can we do how can we
compute this

68
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
compute this
 

69
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,990
compute this
maximum thing you just look

70
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,000
maximum thing you just look
 

71
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,870
maximum thing you just look
maximum steps okay you look at all of

72
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
maximum steps okay you look at all of
 

73
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,950
maximum steps okay you look at all of
the leaves and which one's the lowest

74
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
the leaves and which one's the lowest
 

75
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,310
the leaves and which one's the lowest
look define max

76
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
look define max
 

77
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,950
look define max
steps we can use the recursion yeah

78
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
steps we can use the recursion yeah
 

79
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,749
steps we can use the recursion yeah
remember

80
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
remember
 

81
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,630
remember
yeah the number three how can we define

82
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
yeah the number three how can we define
 

83
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,109
yeah the number three how can we define
the tree

84
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
the tree
 

85
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,109
the tree
first first of all class three

86
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
first first of all class three
 

87
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,630
first first of all class three
yeah and then define

88
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
yeah and then define
 

89
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,030
yeah and then define
underscore

90
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040

 

91
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,430

left right okay

92
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
left right okay
 

93
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,350
left right okay
and then we can say self talk

94
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
and then we can say self talk
 

95
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,030
and then we can say self talk
load equals

96
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
load equals
 

97
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,309
load equals
uh set of top value top value because

98
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
uh set of top value top value because
 

99
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,309
uh set of top value top value because
equal at least we can do this value

100
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
equal at least we can do this value
 

101
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,750
equal at least we can do this value
equals value

102
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
equals value
 

103
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,070
equals value
and then sell the left

104
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
and then sell the left
 

105
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,710
and then sell the left
equals left and self

106
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
equals left and self
 

107
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,110
equals left and self
right so this is the definition of

108
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
right so this is the definition of
 

109
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,030
right so this is the definition of
a tree so look we can specify left left

110
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
a tree so look we can specify left left
 

111
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,830
a tree so look we can specify left left
you can say by default is the lung and

112
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
you can say by default is the lung and
 

113
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,869
you can say by default is the lung and
diabetic

114
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
diabetic
 

115
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,750
diabetic
now yes so basically we can say

116
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
now yes so basically we can say
 

117
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,110
now yes so basically we can say
root after we define this we can say

118
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
root after we define this we can say
 

119
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,830
root after we define this we can say
root

120
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
root
 

121
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,790
root
equals 3 and then we give a value so

122
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:04,800
equals 3 and then we give a value so
 

123
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,229
equals 3 and then we give a value so
then you a quick creator

124
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
then you a quick creator
 

125
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,910
then you a quick creator
you will initialize you initialize a

126
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
you will initialize you initialize a
 

127
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,070
you will initialize you initialize a
note which is the value one so basically

128
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
note which is the value one so basically
 

129
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,110
note which is the value one so basically
what what happened is

130
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
what what happened is
 

131
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,470
what what happened is
is like that yeah

132
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
is like that yeah
 

133
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,990
is like that yeah
okay yes and then i can say a equals

134
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
okay yes and then i can say a equals
 

135
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,630
okay yes and then i can say a equals
three two what does mean it means that

136
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
three two what does mean it means that
 

137
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,390
three two what does mean it means that
another note and then i can say blue

138
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
another note and then i can say blue
 

139
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,070
another note and then i can say blue
dot left equals a

140
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
dot left equals a
 

141
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,710
dot left equals a
so what does it mean it means like that

142
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
so what does it mean it means like that
 

143
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,750
so what does it mean it means like that
yes

144
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
yes
 

145
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,550
yes
yes why do you have a number right i

146
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
yes why do you have a number right i
 

147
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,270
yes why do you have a number right i
don't know

148
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
don't know
 

149
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,910
don't know
this is the reason this is rule this is

150
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
this is the reason this is rule this is
 

151
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,949
this is the reason this is rule this is
children okay

152
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
children okay
 

153
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,229
children okay
so look i can say b equals three

154
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
so look i can say b equals three
 

155
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,550
so look i can say b equals three
three so what does it mean i create

156
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
three so what does it mean i create
 

157
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,990
three so what does it mean i create
another three here

158
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
another three here
 

159
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,190
another three here
and i can say loot dot right

160
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200

 

161
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,550

equals b so you put this yeah

162
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
equals b so you put this yeah
 

163
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,110
equals b so you put this yeah
yeah yeah select the left equals left

164
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
yeah yeah select the left equals left
 

165
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,750
yeah yeah select the left equals left
and then

166
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
and then
 

167
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,830
and then
left and right but this is the call what

168
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
left and right but this is the call what
 

169
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,910
left and right but this is the call what
what do we call this

170
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
what do we call this
 

171
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,670
what do we call this
initi constructor

172
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
initi constructor
 

173
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,270
initi constructor
constructor of a class so this

174
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
constructor of a class so this
 

175
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,069
constructor of a class so this
this is a special function that is

176
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
this is a special function that is
 

177
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,030
this is a special function that is
called

178
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
called
 

179
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,550
called
when we do this right if we are doing

180
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
when we do this right if we are doing
 

181
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,949
when we do this right if we are doing
this

182
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
this
 

183
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,150
this
eric we were doing this we were doing

184
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
eric we were doing this we were doing
 

185
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,790
eric we were doing this we were doing
this

186
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
this
 

187
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,629
this
three you call this constructor okay

188
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
three you call this constructor okay
 

189
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,629
three you call this constructor okay
yeah okay so now going back to this

190
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
yeah okay so now going back to this
 

191
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,629
yeah okay so now going back to this
problem

192
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
problem
 

193
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,550
problem
so look if loot

194
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
so look if loot
 

195
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,749
so look if loot
is now so what's

196
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
is now so what's
 

197
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,830
is now so what's
what's the depth of uh

198
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
what's the depth of uh
 

199
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,270
what's the depth of uh
empty note what's the depth

200
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
empty note what's the depth
 

201
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,710
empty note what's the depth
return what number return where down

202
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
return what number return where down
 

203
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,310
return what number return where down
within zero yeah

204
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
within zero yeah
 

205
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,430
within zero yeah
yes because empty now has zero

206
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
yes because empty now has zero
 

207
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,430
yes because empty now has zero
depth now we we need to call this

208
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
depth now we we need to call this
 

209
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,270
depth now we we need to call this
recursion

210
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
recursion
 

211
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,469
recursion
left and right three to get the depth of

212
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
left and right three to get the depth of
 

213
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,350
left and right three to get the depth of
both

214
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
both
 

215
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,390
both
and then the value of the maximum depth

216
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
and then the value of the maximum depth
 

217
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,710
and then the value of the maximum depth
of the current load that will be

218
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
of the current load that will be
 

219
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,390
of the current load that will be
the maximum right right what you're

220
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
the maximum right right what you're
 

221
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,830
the maximum right right what you're
doing

222
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
doing
 

223
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,110
doing
right uh

224
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
right uh
 

225
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,310
right uh
so how can we do this look

226
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
so how can we do this look
 

227
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,710
so how can we do this look
f left equals max

228
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
f left equals max
 

229
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,350
f left equals max
steps what should happen here

230
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360

 

231
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,390

left right no low dowa we are

232
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
left right no low dowa we are
 

233
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,469
left right no low dowa we are
calculating the left tree

234
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
calculating the left tree
 

235
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,990
calculating the left tree
so look this is the left and right okay

236
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
so look this is the left and right okay
 

237
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,590
so look this is the left and right okay
okay so now i'm here blue that here

238
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
okay so now i'm here blue that here
 

239
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,070
okay so now i'm here blue that here
and i want to calculate the left depth

240
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
and i want to calculate the left depth
 

241
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,790
and i want to calculate the left depth
yeah

242
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
yeah
 

243
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,909
yeah
so that will be do the left right the

244
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
so that will be do the left right the
 

245
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,189
so that will be do the left right the
next one must be white

246
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
next one must be white
 

247
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,590
next one must be white
and right i i want to calculate the

248
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
and right i i want to calculate the
 

249
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,230
and right i i want to calculate the
right depth

250
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
right depth
 

251
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,790
right depth
so we need to do the same with the left

252
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
so we need to do the same with the left
 

253
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,909
so we need to do the same with the left
change

254
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919

 

255
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,469

look so this this bit is the depth of

256
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
look so this this bit is the depth of
 

257
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,670
look so this this bit is the depth of
this tree and then

258
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
this tree and then
 

259
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,670
this tree and then
left is the left of this tree and then

260
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
left is the left of this tree and then
 

261
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,710
left is the left of this tree and then
we turn one

262
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
we turn one
 

263
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,350
we turn one
so what's that what should we do 10 with

264
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
so what's that what should we do 10 with
 

265
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,629
so what's that what should we do 10 with
the left and right

266
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
the left and right
 

267
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,150
the left and right
so which one is the maximum yeah

268
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
so which one is the maximum yeah
 

269
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,350
so which one is the maximum yeah
they're both the same maximum left

270
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
they're both the same maximum left
 

271
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,790
they're both the same maximum left
and right but again we need to do what

272
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
and right but again we need to do what
 

273
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,749
and right but again we need to do what
because one yeah yeah exactly we need to

274
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
because one yeah yeah exactly we need to
 

275
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,150
because one yeah yeah exactly we need to
plus

276
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
plus
 

277
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,430
plus
one yeah right because look

278
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
one yeah right because look
 

279
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,469
one yeah right because look
the this is if this is maximum

280
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
the this is if this is maximum
 

281
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,430
the this is if this is maximum
this one is maximum two right yes this

282
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
this one is maximum two right yes this
 

283
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:35,909
this one is maximum two right yes this
is one

284
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
is one
 

285
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,309
is one
two is maximum and one right and the

286
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
two is maximum and one right and the
 

287
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,469
two is maximum and one right and the
depth should be two plus one because we

288
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
depth should be two plus one because we
 

289
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,749
depth should be two plus one because we
are we need to add the

290
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
are we need to add the
 

291
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,270
are we need to add the
depth of the root got it yeah

292
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
depth of the root got it yeah
 

293
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,990
depth of the root got it yeah
do you understand yeah

294
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000

 

295
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,790

you can actually don't need assignment

296
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
you can actually don't need assignment
 

297
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,589
you can actually don't need assignment
you can just put

298
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
you can just put
 

299
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,189
you can just put
return max maximum download left

300
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
return max maximum download left
 

301
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,070

304
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
one and then you can squeeze these two
 

305
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,950
one and then you can squeeze these two
lines into one

306

lines into one
 

307
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,150

okay yes okay so

308
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
okay yes okay so
 

309
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,810
okay yes okay so
what's the time complexity

310
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:09,820
what's the time complexity

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
binary tree is
 

321
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,909
binary tree is
is just like a single list since it's a

is just like a single list since it's a
 

323
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,469
is just like a single list since it's a
it's just one uh linked list yeah okay

324
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
it's just one uh linked list yeah okay

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,430
it's just one uh linked list yeah okay
then nonlinear will be n depth yeah it

326
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
then nonlinear will be n depth yeah it
 

327
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,309
then nonlinear will be n depth yeah it
will be n
