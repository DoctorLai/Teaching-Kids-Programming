1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,429

hi

2
00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:01,439
hi
 

3
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,230
hi
hello mr mr ryan are you right yeah

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,240
hello mr mr ryan are you right yeah
 

5
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,710
hello mr mr ryan are you right yeah
okay so today we're given the array of

6
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720
okay so today we're given the array of
 

7
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,710
okay so today we're given the array of
numbers a list of numbers

8
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,720
numbers a list of numbers
 

9
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,749
numbers a list of numbers
and we want to find out uh a meter index

10
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:11,759
and we want to find out uh a meter index
 

11
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,830
and we want to find out uh a meter index
so let's define this middle index okay

12
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:13,840
so let's define this middle index okay
 

13
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,550
so let's define this middle index okay
middle index what's negative minus one

14
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,560
middle index what's negative minus one
 

15
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,590
middle index what's negative minus one
i think no so middle index

16
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
i think no so middle index
 

17
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,550
i think no so middle index
you split the you split the array into

18
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
you split the you split the array into
 

19
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,870
you split the you split the array into
two halves right the left and the most

20
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:24,880
two halves right the left and the most
 

21
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,070
two halves right the left and the most
if the sum of left yeah we use this if

22
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
if the sum of left yeah we use this if
 

23
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,349
if the sum of left yeah we use this if
the sum of left yeah this meter index

24
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
the sum of left yeah this meter index
 

25
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,870
the sum of left yeah this meter index
let's call it

26
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
let's call it
 

27
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,069
let's call it
uh

28
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
uh
 

29
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,110
uh
m okay

30
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
m okay
 

31
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,030
m okay
we sum the middle index of uh plus

32
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
we sum the middle index of uh plus
 

33
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,430
we sum the middle index of uh plus
sum yes sum of s this is array s

34
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
sum yes sum of s this is array s
 

35
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,389
sum yes sum of s this is array s
up to

36
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
up to
 

37
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,069
up to
middle index m

38
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
middle index m
 

39
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,510
middle index m
yeah

40
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
yeah
 

41
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,029
yeah
give the index m is equals to the sum of

42
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
give the index m is equals to the sum of
 

43
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,910
give the index m is equals to the sum of
the

44
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
the
 

45
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,350
the
s

46
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
s
 

47
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,630
s
m plus one okay and plus from n plus one

48
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
m plus one okay and plus from n plus one
 

49
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,670
m plus one okay and plus from n plus one
to the end

50
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
to the end
 

51
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,470
to the end
so

52
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
so
 

53
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,310
so
so can you find if if there are multiple

54
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
so can you find if if there are multiple
 

55
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,270
so can you find if if there are multiple
mineral index just pick the decimals one

56
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
mineral index just pick the decimals one
 

57
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,670
mineral index just pick the decimals one
okay this is easy this is easy which is

58
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
okay this is easy this is easy which is
 

59
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,710
okay this is easy this is easy which is
index

60
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
index
 

61
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,149
index
two

62
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:08,159
two
 

63
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,990
two
what is that

64
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
what is that
 

65
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,390
what is that
zero one two

66
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
zero one two
 

67
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,230
zero one two
so you choose this estimated index

68
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
so you choose this estimated index
 

69
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,469
so you choose this estimated index
what's the sum of these that's five

70
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
what's the sum of these that's five
 

71
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,310
what's the sum of these that's five
what's the sum of this this 12 this does

72
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
what's the sum of this this 12 this does
 

73
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,590
what's the sum of this this 12 this does
not equal

74
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
not equal
 

75
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,630
not equal
oh what's this

76
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
oh what's this
 

77
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,030
oh what's this
wait wait yeah what's the middle index

eight

86
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
eight
 

87
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,030
eight
the middle english still one two three

88
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
the middle english still one two three
 

89
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,069
the middle english still one two three
okay

90
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:36,079
okay
 

91
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,830
okay
so i picked these as the meanings what's

92
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
so i picked these as the meanings what's
 

93
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:48,950
so i picked these as the meanings what's
the number this one right

94
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960

 

95
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,270

two plus three plus minus one is four

96
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
two plus three plus minus one is four
 

97
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,190
two plus three plus minus one is four
and what's the rightmost part four you

98
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
and what's the rightmost part four you
 

99
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,270
and what's the rightmost part four you
can choose the meter index as the first

100
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
can choose the meter index as the first
 

101
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,870
can choose the meter index as the first
one in this case

102
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
one in this case
 

103
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,990
one in this case
the left sum would be zero right if you

104
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
the left sum would be zero right if you
 

105
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,749
the left sum would be zero right if you
choose the in with the index the last

106
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
choose the in with the index the last
 

107
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,789
choose the in with the index the last
one the the sum of the right part is

108
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
one the the sum of the right part is
 

109
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,670
one the the sum of the right part is
zero

110
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
zero
 

111
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,469
zero
yeah remember this is the sum yeah yeah

112
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
yeah remember this is the sum yeah yeah
 

113
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,029
yeah remember this is the sum yeah yeah
this is some some simple okay

114
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:11,039
this is some some simple okay
 

115
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,430
this is some some simple okay
and in python we can use this any idea

116
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
and in python we can use this any idea
 

117
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,589
and in python we can use this any idea
easy that should be very easy

118
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
easy that should be very easy
 

119
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,630
easy that should be very easy

we have at least numbs
 

153
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,550
we have at least numbs
okay so now

154
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
okay so now
 

155
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,150
okay so now
uh we need to

156
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
uh we need to
 

157
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,710
uh we need to
what what's the end n equals length num

158
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
what what's the end n equals length num
 

159
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,149
what what's the end n equals length num
right the length

160
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
right the length
 

161
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,229
right the length
yeah okay so now what should we do we

162
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
yeah okay so now what should we do we
 

163
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,830
yeah okay so now what should we do we
should go for the yeah let's say four

164
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
should go for the yeah let's say four

come on
and when you end come on

174
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
and when you end come on
 

175
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,110
and when you end come on
and now what's the sum of the left path

176
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
and now what's the sum of the left path
 

177
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,630
and now what's the sum of the left path
the left part will be

178
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
the left part will be
 

179
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,830
the left part will be
l will be sum then we use this function

180
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
l will be sum then we use this function
 

181
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,229
l will be sum then we use this function
some places impressive sum yeah

182
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
some places impressive sum yeah
 

183
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,229
some places impressive sum yeah
and then the left part numbs number

184
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
and then the left part numbs number
 

185
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,149
and then the left part numbs number
numbers up to what i up to i i plus

186
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
numbers up to what i up to i i plus
 

187
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,430
numbers up to what i up to i i plus
one

188
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
one
 

189
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,910
one
after i plus one right is it true i

190
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
after i plus one right is it true i
 

191
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,869
after i plus one right is it true i
don't know

192
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
don't know
 

193
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,670
don't know
what oh no

194
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
what oh no
 

195
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,630
what oh no
no normally i don't i plus one do i need

196
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
no normally i don't i plus one do i need
 

197
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:57,830
no normally i don't i plus one do i need
to eyebrow

198
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840

 

199
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,830

yeah

200
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840
yeah
 

201
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,070
yeah
genius okay so can you tell me why we

202
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
genius okay so can you tell me why we
 

203
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,750
genius okay so can you tell me why we
skipped the i we

204
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
skipped the i we
 

205
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,390
skipped the i we
why we skip the numbers i

206
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
why we skip the numbers i
 

207
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,309
why we skip the numbers i
oh because i is the one

208
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
oh because i is the one
 

209
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:33,830
oh because i is the one
which is the middle right yeah if

210
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840

 

211
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,590

okay this is the tricky one what's the

212
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
okay this is the tricky one what's the
 

213
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,540
okay this is the tricky one what's the
time complexity

214
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:38,550

 

215
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:47,110

[Music]

216
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120

 

217
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,670

this is m but here is another n right

218
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
this is m but here is another n right
 

219
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,670
this is m but here is another n right
yeah o n i

220
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
yeah o n i
 

221
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,150
yeah o n i
am right now right now n square but

222
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
am right now right now n square but
 

223
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,990
am right now right now n square but
these air and eyes

224
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
these air and eyes
 

225
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,590
these air and eyes
oh and

226
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
oh and
 

227
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,590
oh and
n plus n is like that

228
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600

 

229
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,150

so how do you simplify o

230
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
so how do you simplify o
 

231
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,110
so how do you simplify o
2 times n how is that when cubic n plus

232
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
2 times n how is that when cubic n plus
 

233
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,790
2 times n how is that when cubic n plus
n 2 n

234
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
n 2 n
 

235
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,550
n 2 n
no i said oh

236
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
no i said oh
 

237
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,749
no i said oh
n plus n is not n times n come on okay

238
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
n plus n is not n times n come on okay
 

239
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,550
n plus n is not n times n come on okay
so o and q om2 times n squared so i drop

240
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
so o and q om2 times n squared so i drop
 

241
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,469
so o and q om2 times n squared so i drop
the constant yeah we drop the constant i

242
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
the constant yeah we drop the constant i
 

243
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,469
the constant yeah we drop the constant i
said n squared yeah yeah but you need to

244
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
said n squared yeah yeah but you need to
 

245
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,870
said n squared yeah yeah but you need to
understand how we're getting this okay

246
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
understand how we're getting this okay
 

247
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,029
understand how we're getting this okay
okay so

248
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
okay so
 

249
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,870
okay so
the the problem with this approach is

250
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
the the problem with this approach is
 

251
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,550
the the problem with this approach is
this sound right

252
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
this sound right
 

253
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,430
this sound right
yeah

254
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
yeah
 

255
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,430
yeah
it's uh taking time right do we need to

256
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
it's uh taking time right do we need to
 

257
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,749
it's uh taking time right do we need to
actually do this i mean

258
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
actually do this i mean
 

259
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,270
actually do this i mean
um she can can we improve this

260
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
um she can can we improve this
 

261
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,070
um she can can we improve this
yes so how can we improve this come on

262
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
yes so how can we improve this come on
 

263
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,430
yes so how can we improve this come on
if if this array right like one two a

264
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
if if this array right like one two a
 

265
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,550
if if this array right like one two a
minus one two three four five six okay

266
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
minus one two three four five six okay
 

267
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,950
minus one two three four five six okay
so if this one if i

268
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
so if this one if i
 

269
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,670
so if this one if i
i can i can do we can do this all one

270
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
i can i can do we can do this all one
 

271
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,590
i can i can do we can do this all one
time and that will be a sum of

272
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
time and that will be a sum of
 

273
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,670
time and that will be a sum of
everything the other numbers right we

274
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
everything the other numbers right we
 

275
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,070
everything the other numbers right we
can do this adding all the numbers yeah

276
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
can do this adding all the numbers yeah
 

277
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,830
can do this adding all the numbers yeah
right

278
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
right
 

279
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,150
right
and if we keep doing it keep adding this

280
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
and if we keep doing it keep adding this
 

281
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,550
and if we keep doing it keep adding this
if we add these

282
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
if we add these
 

283
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,749
if we add these
so we know what

284
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
so we know what
 

285
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,390
so we know what
we know

286
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400

 

287
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,270

we know this path and we also we can

288
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
we know this path and we also we can
 

289
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,670
we know this path and we also we can
also use the s minus this particular sum

290
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
also use the s minus this particular sum
 

291
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,670
also use the s minus this particular sum
of this right here i think it's possible

292
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
of this right here i think it's possible
 

293
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,309
of this right here i think it's possible
why is that yeah i know i'm just i'm i'm

294
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
why is that yeah i know i'm just i'm i'm
 

295
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,909
why is that yeah i know i'm just i'm i'm
just saying that

296
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
just saying that
 

297
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,270
just saying that
we can accumulate

298
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
we can accumulate
 

299
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,350
we can accumulate
let the sum of the left path

300
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
let the sum of the left path
 

301
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,590
let the sum of the left path
the sum of the left path

302
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
the sum of the left path
 

303
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,270
the sum of the left path
yeah we can accumulate the sum of the

304
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
yeah we can accumulate the sum of the
 

305
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,950
yeah we can accumulate the sum of the
plot i plus one

306
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
plot i plus one
 

307
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,350
plot i plus one
and then we use this uh

308
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
and then we use this uh
 

309
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,870
and then we use this uh
i don't know bigger s s minus smaller s

310
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
i don't know bigger s s minus smaller s
 

311
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,550
i don't know bigger s s minus smaller s
then that would be the sum of the right

312
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
then that would be the sum of the right
 

313
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,710
then that would be the sum of the right
most parts right correct

314
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
most parts right correct
 

315
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,550
most parts right correct
it will be similarly as the prefix sound

316
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
it will be similarly as the prefix sound
 

317
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,950
it will be similarly as the prefix sound
remember you know the perfect sound

318
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
remember you know the perfect sound
 

319
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,309
remember you know the perfect sound
we talk about this previous time

320
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
we talk about this previous time
 

321
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,670
we talk about this previous time
remember

322
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
remember
 

323
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,110
remember
yesterday one

324
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
yesterday one
 

325
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,270
yesterday one
two three four five six seven what's the

326
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
two three four five six seven what's the
 

327
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,790
two three four five six seven what's the
sum of these people

328
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800

 

329
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,270

um it is 12

330
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
um it is 12
 

331
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,350
um it is 12
yes but because what's the time

332
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
yes but because what's the time
 

333
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,670
yes but because what's the time
complexity if you just add in the sum

334
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
complexity if you just add in the sum
 

335
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,629
complexity if you just add in the sum
numbers

336
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
numbers
 

337
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,790
numbers
what can we do better yeah

338
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
what can we do better yeah
 

339
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,790
what can we do better yeah
and how do we go together and we just do

340
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
and how do we go together and we just do
 

341
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,670
and how do we go together and we just do
one

342
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
one
 

343
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,870
one
one different

344
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
one different
 

345
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,870
one different
okay yeah let's play with some we

346
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
okay yeah let's play with some we
 

347
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,950
okay yeah let's play with some we
calculate these into this accumulate

348
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
calculate these into this accumulate
 

349
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,029
calculate these into this accumulate
function and remember we accumulate from

350
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
function and remember we accumulate from
 

351
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:17,909
function and remember we accumulate from
here

352
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
here
 

353
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,270
here
accumulate

354
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
accumulate
 

355
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,710
accumulate
and that will give us what one three one

356
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
and that will give us what one three one
 

357
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,790
and that will give us what one three one
one two one what's next

358
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
one two one what's next
 

359
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,110
one two one what's next
one three

360
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
one three
 

361
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,029
one three
six

362
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
six
 

363
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,350
six
um 10

364
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
um 10
 

365
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,270
um 10
15

366
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
15
 

367
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,230
15
21 28 okay so what's the sum of this bit

368
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
21 28 okay so what's the sum of this bit
 

369
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,589
21 28 okay so what's the sum of this bit
is the same as the sum of these four six

370
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
is the same as the sum of these four six
 

371
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,029
is the same as the sum of these four six
numbers uh five numbers which is 15

372
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
numbers uh five numbers which is 15
 

373
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,629
numbers uh five numbers which is 15
right and i need to minus the first

374
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
right and i need to minus the first
 

375
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,230
right and i need to minus the first
two numbers right

376
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
two numbers right
 

377
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,550
two numbers right
yeah the sum of the

378
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
yeah the sum of the
 

379
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,790
yeah the sum of the
of these the numbers from

380
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
of these the numbers from
 

381
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,350
of these the numbers from
3 4 5 is the sum of the first sine

382
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
3 4 5 is the sum of the first sine
 

383
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,909
3 4 5 is the sum of the first sine
number subtract the first two number in

384
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
number subtract the first two number in
 

385
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,790
number subtract the first two number in
this case is 2 is 15 minus 3 equals 12.

386
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
this case is 2 is 15 minus 3 equals 12.
 

387
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,710
this case is 2 is 15 minus 3 equals 12.
look we're just looking up the numbers

388
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
look we're just looking up the numbers
 

389
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,869
look we're just looking up the numbers
and we just subtract one it's 12.

390
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:04,879
and we just subtract one it's 12.
 

391
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,550
and we just subtract one it's 12.
it's frosted it's the same it's a

392
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
it's frosted it's the same it's a
 

393
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,749
it's frosted it's the same it's a
similar

394
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
similar
 

395
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,510
similar
so

396
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
so
 

397
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,189
so
so we can do this okay

398
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
so we can do this okay
 

399
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,390
so we can do this okay

is the first question
 

411
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,869
is the first question
or in the legal context today

412
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
or in the legal context today
 

413
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,629
or in the legal context today
yeah it's continued what do you mean

414
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
yeah it's continued what do you mean
 

415
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,710
yeah it's continued what do you mean
there's a context contest

416
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
there's a context contest
 

417
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,189
there's a context contest
programming context every two weeks

418
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
programming context every two weeks
 

419
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,790
programming context every two weeks
you know every week or probably yeah

420
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
you know every week or probably yeah
 

421
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,709
you know every week or probably yeah
every week yeah yeah this is the first

422
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
every week yeah yeah this is the first
 

423
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,550
every week yeah yeah this is the first
question

424
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
question
 

425
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,630
question
okay so now sum we use the sum how do we

426
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
okay so now sum we use the sum how do we
 

427
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,790
okay so now sum we use the sum how do we
calculate the sum of all the numbers use

428
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
calculate the sum of all the numbers use
 

429
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,790
calculate the sum of all the numbers use
which function

430
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
which function
 

431
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,149
which function
which function

432
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
which function
 

433
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,430
which function
s-u-n yeah

434
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440

 

435
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,470

and then

436
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
and then
 

437
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,710
and then
n will be what n would be length do we

438
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
n will be what n would be length do we
 

439
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,750
n will be what n would be length do we
need the n

440
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
need the n
 

441
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,430
need the n
problem we don't need an n let's do it

442
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
problem we don't need an n let's do it
 

443
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,310
problem we don't need an n let's do it
we use a c to compute the current sum

444
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
we use a c to compute the current sum
 

445
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,829
we use a c to compute the current sum
equals zero

446
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
equals zero
 

447
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,389
equals zero
for

448
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399

451
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,509

forward for for do you still remember

452
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
forward for for do you still remember
 

453
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,949
forward for for do you still remember
the enumerate function remember we

454
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
the enumerate function remember we
 

455
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,870
the enumerate function remember we
talked about the enumeration yesterday

456
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
talked about the enumeration yesterday
 

457
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,350
talked about the enumeration yesterday
yeah what's the enumerator of this abc

458
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
yeah what's the enumerator of this abc
 

459
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,829
yeah what's the enumerator of this abc
come on what does it return

460
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
come on what does it return
 

461
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,190
come on what does it return
what's the initial function a b c

462
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
what's the initial function a b c
 

463
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,870
what's the initial function a b c
and then that's here enumerate one zero

464
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
and then that's here enumerate one zero
 

465
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,630
and then that's here enumerate one zero
one two okay so for i

466
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
one two okay so for i
 

467
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,990
one two okay so for i
let's say x

468
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
let's say x

equal equal equal uh look
this is the array yeah this is the array

492
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
this is the array yeah this is the array
 

493
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,110
this is the array yeah this is the array
and now i'm i know that the whole sum is

494
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
and now i'm i know that the whole sum is
 

495
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,910
and now i'm i know that the whole sum is
s

496
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
s
 

497
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,310
s
and now i'm iterating the x x is the

498
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
and now i'm iterating the x x is the
 

499
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,870
and now i'm iterating the x x is the
middle middle element right if i minus

500
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
middle middle element right if i minus
 

501
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,710
middle middle element right if i minus
this element

502
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
this element
 

503
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,870
this element
and i minus the previous one so what's

504
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
and i minus the previous one so what's
 

505
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,630
and i minus the previous one so what's
what's next

506
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
what's next
 

507
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,230
what's next
what's what's this part is this part

508
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
what's what's this part is this part
 

509
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,710
what's what's this part is this part
right the y power yeah yeah

510
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
right the y power yeah yeah
 

511
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,110
right the y power yeah yeah
look the whole o is s

512
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
look the whole o is s
 

513
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,430
look the whole o is s
look at me the x current the middle

514
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
look at me the x current the middle
 

515
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,509
look at me the x current the middle
element is x yeah

516
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
element is x yeah
 

517
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,350
element is x yeah
and i've subtract x

518
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,360
and i've subtract x
 

519
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,910
and i've subtract x
and i subtract this this bit is c

520
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
and i subtract this this bit is c
 

521
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,230
and i subtract this this bit is c
and what you wrong should we get

522
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
and what you wrong should we get
 

523
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,550
and what you wrong should we get
what should we get the overall is as i

524
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
what should we get the overall is as i
 

525
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,030
what should we get the overall is as i
subtract x is middle i subtract c which

526
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
subtract x is middle i subtract c which
 

527
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,750
subtract x is middle i subtract c which
is the sum up to x

528
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
is the sum up to x
 

529
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,790
is the sum up to x
and then right so

530
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
and then right so
 

531
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,150
and then right so
what should we check the other half

532
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
what should we check the other half
 

533
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,670
what should we check the other half
equals one

534
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
equals one
 

535
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,230
equals one
equals one

536
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
equals one
 

537
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,750
equals one
c let's see

538
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
c let's see
 

539
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,230
c let's see
if we don't know it is

540
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240

 

541
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,509

next return i right that's it and

542
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
next return i right that's it and
 

543
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,670
next return i right that's it and
what's this

544
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
what's this
 

545
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,430
what's this
and

546
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
and
 

547
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,590
and
yeah i know what should we do now

548
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
yeah i know what should we do now
 

549
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,509
yeah i know what should we do now
return return while return minus one

550
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
return return while return minus one
 

551
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,470
return return while return minus one
yeah

552
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
yeah
 

553
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,630
yeah
minus one that's no answer come on

554
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
minus one that's no answer come on
 

555
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,069
minus one that's no answer come on
yes it

556
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
yes it
 

557
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,630
yes it
okay so okay there's one thing missing

558
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
okay so okay there's one thing missing
 

559
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,550
okay so okay there's one thing missing
is there's c we need to update the c c

560
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
is there's c we need to update the c c
 

561
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,030
is there's c we need to update the c c
plus equals one

562
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
plus equals one
 

563
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,870
plus equals one
c plus equals one what c plus equal one

564
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
c plus equals one what c plus equal one
 

565
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:24,550
c plus equals one what c plus equal one
what plus

566
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560

 

567
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,710

so look i i just draw this picture

568
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
so look i i just draw this picture
 

569
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,069
so look i i just draw this picture
remember the whole the whole sound is s

570
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
remember the whole the whole sound is s
 

571
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,310
remember the whole the whole sound is s
and now i'm at x yeah

572
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
and now i'm at x yeah
 

573
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,110
and now i'm at x yeah
this is x this is the index i yeah come

574
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
this is x this is the index i yeah come
 

575
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,310
this is x this is the index i yeah come
on

576
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,320
on
 

577
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,949
on
the index i points to x

578
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
the index i points to x
 

579
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,829
the index i points to x
and then my sum c is the value up to x

580
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
and then my sum c is the value up to x
 

581
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,470
and then my sum c is the value up to x
yeah okay because i put it please after

582
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
yeah okay because i put it please after
 

583
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,069
yeah okay because i put it please after
the e so it's like

584
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
the e so it's like
 

585
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,150
the e so it's like
can you listen to me put it here so this

586
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
can you listen to me put it here so this
 

587
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,230
can you listen to me put it here so this
here is c so what this should be let's

588
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
here is c so what this should be let's
 

589
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,710
here is c so what this should be let's
see right so if it's the c

590
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
see right so if it's the c
 

591
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,110
see right so if it's the c
if the left part is equal to the right

592
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
if the left part is equal to the right
 

593
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,350
if the left part is equal to the right
path right then we return the index i

594
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
path right then we return the index i
 

595
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,910
path right then we return the index i
and then in the next iteration we we

596
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
and then in the next iteration we we
 

597
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,190
and then in the next iteration we we
expand the c

598
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
expand the c
 

599
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,470
expand the c
increment c

600
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
increment c
 

601
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,470
increment c
to x and then we move the x to one

602
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
to x and then we move the x to one
 

603
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,470
to x and then we move the x to one
position to the right okay

604
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
position to the right okay
 

605
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:14,020
position to the right okay
what's the time complexity

606
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,030

we accumulate the answer here right yeah

614
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
we accumulate the answer here right yeah
 

615
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,949
we accumulate the answer here right yeah
got it

616
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
got it
 

617
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,750
got it
okay

618
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
okay
 

619
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,509
okay
can can you write this

620
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
can can you write this
 

621
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,990
can can you write this
can you write this if you correct if you

622
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
can you write this if you correct if you
 

623
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,910
can you write this if you correct if you
know then i'll give it back to you come

624
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
know then i'll give it back to you come
 

625
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,990

627
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:06,949

look this is

628
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959

is the right we want to find the index

634
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,120
is the right we want to find the index
 

635
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,550
is the right we want to find the index
which is the left part equal to the
