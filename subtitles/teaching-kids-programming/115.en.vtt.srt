1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,990

go hello hello hello mr mr ryan how are

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
go hello hello hello mr mr ryan how are
 

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,150
go hello hello hello mr mr ryan how are
you today

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160

 

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,830

okay so today we talked about

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:09,840
okay so today we talked about
 

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,990
okay so today we talked about
intersection of two

8
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
intersection of two
 

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,390
intersection of two
intersections of

10
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400

 

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,310

so previously we talked about the

12
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
so previously we talked about the
 

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,910
so previously we talked about the
intersection of two linked lists

14
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
intersection of two linked lists
 

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,670
intersection of two linked lists
right yeah the principle is quite

16
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
right yeah the principle is quite
 

17
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,750
right yeah the principle is quite
similar how the approach we've taken

18
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
similar how the approach we've taken
 

19
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,390
similar how the approach we've taken
today is

20
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
today is
 

21
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,669
today is
quite similar so let's let's take a look

22
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
quite similar so let's let's take a look
 

23
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,670
quite similar so let's let's take a look
at this example okay

24
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
at this example okay
 

25
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,950
at this example okay
one two three four five

26
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
one two three four five
 

27
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,150
one two three four five
six okay and then eight nine three

28
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160
six okay and then eight nine three
 

29
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,190
six okay and then eight nine three
four five six seven eight so what's the

30
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
four five six seven eight so what's the
 

31
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,709
four five six seven eight so what's the
intersection of these two arrays

32
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719

 

33
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,310

one two three well there's no one here

34
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
one two three well there's no one here
 

35
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,670
one two three well there's no one here
intersection uncommon elements three

36
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
intersection uncommon elements three
 

37
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,189
intersection uncommon elements three
four five okay so these are the unique

38
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
four five okay so these are the unique
 

39
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,510
four five okay so these are the unique
numbers how about if i tell you that i

40
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
numbers how about if i tell you that i
 

41
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,189
numbers how about if i tell you that i
add another three here

42
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
add another three here
 

43
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,830
add another three here
and then stick three should appear once

44
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
and then stick three should appear once
 

45
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,190
and then stick three should appear once
or twice

46
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
or twice
 

47
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,350
or twice
three times how about if i put another

48
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
three times how about if i put another
 

49
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,030
three times how about if i put another
and how many three

50
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
and how many three
 

51
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,030
and how many three
two three so i need to put three here

52
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
two three so i need to put three here
 

53
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,149
two three so i need to put three here
right

54
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
right
 

55
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,550
right
all right so it's the intersection the

56
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
all right so it's the intersection the
 

57
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,510
all right so it's the intersection the
common parts

58
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
common parts
 

59
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,830
common parts
and if they are duplicate numbers you

60
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
and if they are duplicate numbers you
 

61
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,590
and if they are duplicate numbers you
should only have a

62
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
should only have a
 

63
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,390
should only have a
the minimum the less number now appears

64
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
the minimum the less number now appears
 

65
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,030
the minimum the less number now appears
because look

66
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
because look
 

67
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,910
because look
if three appears one here appears twice

68
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
if three appears one here appears twice
 

69
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,789
if three appears one here appears twice
here

70
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
here
 

71
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,310
here
then in the intersection there will be

72
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
then in the intersection there will be
 

73
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,990
then in the intersection there will be
only one right yeah if

74
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
only one right yeah if
 

75
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,630
only one right yeah if
that appears three times here and two

76
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
that appears three times here and two
 

77
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,670
that appears three times here and two
times here

78
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:39,680
times here
 

79
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,950
times here
so how many times i should put it here

80
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
so how many times i should put it here
 

81
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,630
so how many times i should put it here
two times two times okay

82
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
two times two times okay
 

83
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,149
two times two times okay
the hug what's the one coincidence

84
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
the hug what's the one coincidence
 

85
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,469
the hug what's the one coincidence
i'm not asking anything what's the

86
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
i'm not asking anything what's the
 

87
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,270
i'm not asking anything what's the
approach to

88
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
approach to

bluefox how to improve us checking every

102
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
bluefox how to improve us checking every
 

103
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,589
bluefox how to improve us checking every
thing checking every number in going

104
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
thing checking every number in going
 

105
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,910
thing checking every number in going
through each number on the first array

106
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
through each number on the first array
 

107
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,589
through each number on the first array
and then check if they appears in the

108
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
and then check if they appears in the
 

109
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,949
and then check if they appears in the
second array right yeah

110
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
second array right yeah
 

111
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,350
second array right yeah
so for example like one and i go through

112
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
so for example like one and i go through
 

113
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,510
so for example like one and i go through
these the second array

114
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
these the second array
 

115
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,910
these the second array
and how uh and to see if it has a one so

116
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
and how uh and to see if it has a one so
 

117
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,790
and how uh and to see if it has a one so
if this is

118
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
if this is
 

119
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,030
if this is
n this is m and animal what's the time

120
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
n this is m and animal what's the time
 

121
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,070
n this is m and animal what's the time
complexity

122
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
complexity
 

123
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,430
complexity
uh

124
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440

 

125
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,030

and thailand yeah that's cool

126
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,040
and thailand yeah that's cool
 

127
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,430
and thailand yeah that's cool
yeah because for each n numbers i need

128
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
yeah because for each n numbers i need
 

129
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,790
yeah because for each n numbers i need
to go through the second

130
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
to go through the second
 

131
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,710
to go through the second
element to check if it appears here and

132
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
element to check if it appears here and
 

133
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,309
element to check if it appears here and
there's only uh there's also

134
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
there's only uh there's also
 

135
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,830
there's only uh there's also
ones uh one thing to note is that

136
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
ones uh one thing to note is that
 

137
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,070
ones uh one thing to note is that
how do we how are we dealing with these

138
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
how do we how are we dealing with these
 

139
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,030
how do we how are we dealing with these
duplicate numbers for

140
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
duplicate numbers for
 

141
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,550
duplicate numbers for
over if there are three and then you

142
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
over if there are three and then you
 

143
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,470
over if there are three and then you
find a three right

144
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
find a three right
 

145
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,710
find a three right
i let you put a result in three in the

146
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
i let you put a result in three in the
 

147
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,710
i let you put a result in three in the
result but you need to remove the three

148
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
result but you need to remove the three
 

149
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,589
result but you need to remove the three
from

150
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
from
 

151
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,430
from
from the second number so it doesn't

152
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
from the second number so it doesn't
 

153
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,750
from the second number so it doesn't
count next time when you have a three

154
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
count next time when you have a three
 

155
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,350
count next time when you have a three
got it i'm right

156
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
got it i'm right
 

157
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,190
got it i'm right
how about if you don't look if there are

158
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,200
how about if you don't look if there are
 

159
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,790
how about if you don't look if there are
two threes and there's only one three

160
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
two threes and there's only one three
 

161
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,270
two threes and there's only one three
here

162
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
here
 

163
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,710
here
if you don't know you move it what

164
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
if you don't know you move it what
 

165
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,630
if you don't know you move it what
happened three it appears

166
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
happened three it appears
 

167
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,869
happened three it appears
here you put a three and then three

168
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
here you put a three and then three
 

169
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,309
here you put a three and then three
appears here again you put

170
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
appears here again you put
 

171
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,630
appears here again you put
another three but which is long yeah

172
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
another three but which is long yeah
 

173
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,030
another three but which is long yeah
it's incredible because it

174
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
it's incredible because it
 

175
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,710
it's incredible because it
only appears once in a second array

176
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
only appears once in a second array
 

177
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,110
only appears once in a second array
right so how do we fix this

178
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
right so how do we fix this
 

179
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,350
right so how do we fix this
is that when we go into the first array

180
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
is that when we go into the first array
 

181
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,229
is that when we go into the first array
we find

182
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
we find
 

183
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,190
we find
immediately as as long as we find it in

184
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
immediately as as long as we find it in
 

185
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,789
immediately as as long as we find it in
the second array

186
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
the second array
 

187
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,949
the second array
we put it in a result and we remove it

188
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
we put it in a result and we remove it
 

189
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,589
we put it in a result and we remove it
yeah all right this makes sense

190
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:37,599
yeah all right this makes sense
 

191
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,910
yeah all right this makes sense
this is blue for us so it's all end

192
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
this is blue for us so it's all end
 

193
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,949
this is blue for us so it's all end
times and

194
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
times and
 

195
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,390
times and
you're mentioning we are using we can

196
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
you're mentioning we are using we can
 

197
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,630
you're mentioning we are using we can
use the notebook right the notebook is a

198
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
use the notebook right the notebook is a
 

199
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,750
use the notebook right the notebook is a
good for the lookup

200
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
good for the lookup
 

201
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,030
good for the lookup
what's the time complex yeah but

202
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
what's the time complex yeah but
 

203
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,710
what's the time complex yeah but
we need the old end time to put it in

204
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
we need the old end time to put it in
 

205
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,550
we need the old end time to put it in
the notebook right leave it at them

206
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
the notebook right leave it at them
 

207
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,229
the notebook right leave it at them
and and apples yeah we want to put it

208
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
and and apples yeah we want to put it
 

209
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,030
and and apples yeah we want to put it
you know

210
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
you know
 

211
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,350
you know
i love apples yeah good and then it

212
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
i love apples yeah good and then it
 

213
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,949
i love apples yeah good and then it
needs the end times right

214
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
needs the end times right
 

215
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,990
needs the end times right
so so if we put it into the

216
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
so so if we put it into the
 

217
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,869
so so if we put it into the
notebook so we also need to remember how

218
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:06,879
notebook so we also need to remember how
 

219
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,270
notebook so we also need to remember how
many times it appears in array right

220
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,280
many times it appears in array right
 

221
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,830
many times it appears in array right
yeah we because for example this this

222
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
yeah we because for example this this
 

223
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,949
yeah we because for example this this
one three three

224
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
one three three
 

225
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,069
one three three
we need to have a a notebook saying like

226
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
we need to have a a notebook saying like
 

227
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,030
we need to have a a notebook saying like
okay three

228
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
okay three
 

229
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,550
okay three
appears twice right yeah i'm right

230
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
appears twice right yeah i'm right
 

231
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,830
appears twice right yeah i'm right
no book so what's the what's the

232
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
no book so what's the what's the
 

233
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,070
no book so what's the what's the
we we can go through this like this is

234
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
we we can go through this like this is
 

235
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,670
we we can go through this like this is
numbers then we can say for

236
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
numbers then we can say for
 

237
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,870
numbers then we can say for
i this is notebook okay then we can say

238
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
i this is notebook okay then we can say
 

239
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,629
i this is notebook okay then we can say
notebook uh dictionary default before

240
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
notebook uh dictionary default before
 

241
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,710
notebook uh dictionary default before
this dictionary which is the type of

242
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
this dictionary which is the type of
 

243
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,070
this dictionary which is the type of
integer and for i

244
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
integer and for i
 

245
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,990
integer and for i
in nums and then we can do this

246
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000

 

247
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,950

plus equals one right yeah yeah but all

248
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
plus equals one right yeah yeah but all
 

249
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,749
plus equals one right yeah yeah but all
these

250
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
these
 

251
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,110
these
all these can be can be converted

252
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
all these can be can be converted
 

253
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,110
all these can be can be converted
converted into what remember we're

254
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
converted into what remember we're
 

255
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,030
converted into what remember we're
talking about a

256
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
talking about a
 

257
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,070
talking about a
magic class in python which can count

258
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
magic class in python which can count
 

259
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,230
magic class in python which can count
the number of elements and how many

260
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
the number of elements and how many
 

261
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,270
the number of elements and how many
times they appeared

262
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
times they appeared
 

263
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,629
times they appeared
in in a way what what what's the object

264
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
in in a way what what what's the object
 

265
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,990
in in a way what what what's the object
start with c o

266
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
start with c o
 

267
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,189
start with c o
c o count counter

268
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
c o count counter
 

269
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,070
c o count counter
yeah so all these yeah can it can be

270
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
yeah so all these yeah can it can be
 

271
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,350
yeah so all these yeah can it can be
turning into

272
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
turning into
 

273
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,870
turning into
notebook equals counter we want to count

274
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
notebook equals counter we want to count
 

275
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,350
notebook equals counter we want to count
what

276
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
what
 

277
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,550
what
call the numbers yeah so this this three

278
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
call the numbers yeah so this this three
 

279
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,029
call the numbers yeah so this this three
lines

280
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
lines
 

281
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,790
lines
is exactly the same because this is

282
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
is exactly the same because this is
 

283
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,469
is exactly the same because this is
that's the same thing for you

284
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
that's the same thing for you
 

285
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,710
that's the same thing for you
okay so when we have the counter for

286
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
okay so when we have the counter for
 

287
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,590
okay so when we have the counter for
these two

288
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
these two
 

289
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,590
these two
counter which is the notebook when we

290
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
counter which is the notebook when we
 

291
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,110
counter which is the notebook when we
have the counter for these two arrays

292
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
have the counter for these two arrays
 

293
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,870
have the counter for these two arrays
and we can go through the keys

294
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
and we can go through the keys
 

295
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,629
and we can go through the keys
the number the number of the notebook

296
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
the number the number of the notebook
 

297
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,230
the number the number of the notebook
and then appears it

298
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
and then appears it
 

299
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,430
and then appears it
and append the same numbers

300
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
and append the same numbers
 

301
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,749
and append the same numbers
in the result okay let's do it

302
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759

 

303
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,430

define let's say in

304
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
define let's say in
 

305
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,430
define let's say in
in the section okay then array one

306
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
in the section okay then array one
 

307
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,469
in the section okay then array one
column let's say a b

308
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
column let's say a b
 

309
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,990
column let's say a b
column yeah okay so you tell me okay the

310
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
column yeah okay so you tell me okay the
 

311
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,629
column yeah okay so you tell me okay the
notebook

312
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
notebook
 

313
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,029
notebook
notebook one no book a notebook a equals

314
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
notebook one no book a notebook a equals
 

315
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,189
notebook one no book a notebook a equals
counter yeah

316
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
counter yeah
 

317
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,629
counter yeah
a and notebook b equals counter

318
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
a and notebook b equals counter
 

319
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,830
a and notebook b equals counter
b okay so now these two lines

320
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
b okay so now these two lines
 

321
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,029
b okay so now these two lines
just count how many numbers

322
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
just count how many numbers
 

323
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,790
just count how many numbers
in the array in both array right and

324
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
in the array in both array right and
 

325
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,390
in the array in both array right and
then put it uh

326
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
then put it uh
 

327
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,469
then put it uh
put it in the notebook okay let now we

328
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
put it in the notebook okay let now we
 

329
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,309
put it in the notebook okay let now we
go through one array of this yeah

330
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
go through one array of this yeah
 

331
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,469
go through one array of this yeah
for i in notebook a

332
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
for i in notebook a
 

333
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,990
for i in notebook a
right now

334
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000

 

335
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,150

then this i for example is three and we

336
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,160
then this i for example is three and we
 

337
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,749
then this i for example is three and we
want to find out if three

338
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
want to find out if three
 

339
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,150
want to find out if three
is in no book b how can we do it all

340
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
is in no book b how can we do it all
 

341
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,830
is in no book b how can we do it all
right

342
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840

 

343
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,550

uh

344
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560

 

345
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,230

sorry if this i is in the notebook a and

346
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
sorry if this i is in the notebook a and
 

347
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,909
sorry if this i is in the notebook a and
i want to find out if this number is

348
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
i want to find out if this number is
 

349
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,990
i want to find out if this number is
also in the notebook b so how can we do

350
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
also in the notebook b so how can we do
 

351
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
also in the notebook b so how can we do
it if i

352
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:03,850
it if i

355
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,510

so this number appears in both now at

356
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
so this number appears in both now at
 

357
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,830
so this number appears in both now at
least here this number appears in

358
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
least here this number appears in
 

359
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,550
least here this number appears in
both array right yeah so what do we do

360
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
both array right yeah so what do we do
 

361
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,029
both array right yeah so what do we do
now

362
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
now
 

363
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,790
now
if this number appears three times in

364
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
if this number appears three times in
 

365
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,950
if this number appears three times in
the first array and appears two times in

366
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
the first array and appears two times in
 

367
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,350
the first array and appears two times in
the second array so what do we do now

368
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
the second array so what do we do now
 

369
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:43,029
the second array so what do we do now
uh pretend

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
this answer okay so
 

375
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,189
this answer okay so
if the three appears two times in the

376
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
if the three appears two times in the
 

377
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,110
if the three appears two times in the
first array and then one time in the

378
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
first array and then one time in the
 

379
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,790
first array and then one time in the
second array so how many times

380
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
second array so how many times
 

381
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,390
second array so how many times
of three we need to add it in the

382
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
of three we need to add it in the

390
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
let's say for in range we want to put it
 

391
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,510
let's say for in range we want to put it
in a minimum so that's

392
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
in a minimum so that's

two times here
 

421
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,509
two times here
and b i which is one time here get a

422
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
and b i which is one time here get a
 

423
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,150

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,670
remember this link listing this is
a this is b and how can we

506
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680
a this is b and how can we
 

507
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,630
a this is b and how can we
how can we do this we put the last one

508
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
how can we do this we put the last one
 

509
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,630
how can we do this we put the last one
together and then keep on going

510
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640

 

511
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,150

a has half and b

512
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
a has half and b
 

513
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,190
a has half and b
has half and and uh you're trying to

514
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
has half and and uh you're trying to
 

515
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,590
has half and and uh you're trying to
make

516
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:17,600
make
 

517
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,509
make
a whole wait if a had half of a knuckle

518
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
a whole wait if a had half of a knuckle
 

519
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,550
a whole wait if a had half of a knuckle
and b had half an apple

520
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
and b had half an apple
 

521
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,670
and b had half an apple
and you tried to make a whole apple and

522
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
and you tried to make a whole apple and
 

523
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,790
and you tried to make a whole apple and
then

524
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
then
 

525
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,670
then
put them together yeah how many hot

526
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
put them together yeah how many hot
 

527
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,470
put them together yeah how many hot
apples

528
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
apples
 

529
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,310
apples
first of all these two you take away

530
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
first of all these two you take away
 

531
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,230
first of all these two you take away
half of each one

532
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
half of each one
 

533
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,910
half of each one
then put and the always still

534
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
then put and the always still
 

535
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,310
then put and the always still
there two pointers and two pointers yeah

536
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
there two pointers and two pointers yeah
 

537
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,949
there two pointers and two pointers yeah
exactly

538
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
exactly
 

539
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,350
exactly
so look in order for this aggregate to

540
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
so look in order for this aggregate to
 

541
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,389
so look in order for this aggregate to
work

542
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
work
 

543
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,350
work
we need two pointers two points but

544
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
we need two pointers two points but
 

545
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,990
we need two pointers two points but
these are

546
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
these are
 

547
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,310
these are
this linked list needs to be sorted all

548
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
this linked list needs to be sorted all
 

549
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,990
this linked list needs to be sorted all
right yes

550
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
right yes
 

551
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,030
right yes
look yeah look one smaller than two so

552
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,040
look yeah look one smaller than two so
 

553
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,750
look yeah look one smaller than two so
should i move two or one

554
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
should i move two or one
 

555
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,110
should i move two or one
one two and two okay it's the same so we

556
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
one two and two okay it's the same so we
 

557
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,509
one two and two okay it's the same so we
have

558
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
have
 

559
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,590
have
it out we added and then we move it

560
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
it out we added and then we move it
 

561
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,110
it out we added and then we move it
together three equals three

562
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
together three equals three
 

563
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,470
together three equals three
yeah four equals four

564
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
yeah four equals four
 

565
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,069
yeah four equals four
yeah and then and then what when

566
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
yeah and then and then what when
 

567
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,389
yeah and then and then what when
when these one any of these is beyond

568
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:16,399
when these one any of these is beyond
 

569
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,430
when these one any of these is beyond
the end then we

570
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
the end then we
 

571
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,350
the end then we
call the end okay yeah so it's 23 points

572
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
call the end okay yeah so it's 23 points
 

573
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,910
call the end okay yeah so it's 23 points
like two and three okay so for example

574
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
like two and three okay so for example
 

575
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,710
like two and three okay so for example
for example

576
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
for example
 

577
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,509
for example
so we can apply these the numbers look

578
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
so we can apply these the numbers look
 

579
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,030
so we can apply these the numbers look
first of all we need to sort the

580
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
first of all we need to sort the
 

581
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,350
first of all we need to sort the
array right if the array is not in order

582
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
array right if the array is not in order
 

583
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,710
array right if the array is not in order
we can apply these two points

584
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
we can apply these two points
 

585
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,710
we can apply these two points
right all right does it make sense yeah

586
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
right all right does it make sense yeah
 

587
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,470
right all right does it make sense yeah
okay so look one if we started one three

588
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
okay so look one if we started one three
 

589
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,990
okay so look one if we started one three
four nine nine okay and then this one

590
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
four nine nine okay and then this one
 

591
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,110
four nine nine okay and then this one
let's say

592
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
let's say
 

593
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,829
let's say
three nine seven uh so unite

594
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
three nine seven uh so unite
 

595
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,670
three nine seven uh so unite
ten okay look this is already

596
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
ten okay look this is already
 

597
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,069
ten okay look this is already
a result answer one and three

598
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
a result answer one and three
 

599
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,069
a result answer one and three
so one is smaller than three so i move

600
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
so one is smaller than three so i move
 

601
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,990
so one is smaller than three so i move
one also almost three one

602
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
one also almost three one
 

603
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,550
one also almost three one
so yeah equal all right let's put

604
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
so yeah equal all right let's put
 

605
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,110
so yeah equal all right let's put
another

606
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
another
 

607
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,150
another
duplicate number three here okay

608
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
duplicate number three here okay
 

609
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,470
duplicate number three here okay
and then i just put another nine here

610
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
and then i just put another nine here
 

611
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,470
and then i just put another nine here
and another nine here okay

612
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
and another nine here okay
 

613
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,509
and another nine here okay
so three three and three 23 here

614
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
so three three and three 23 here
 

615
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,710
so three three and three 23 here
and i need to move

616
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
and i need to move
 

617
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,710
and i need to move
both yeah yeah three and nine

618
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
both yeah yeah three and nine
 

619
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,750
both yeah yeah three and nine
move through your nine

620
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760

 

621
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,430

three four nine move forward all night

622
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
three four nine move forward all night
 

623
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,069
three four nine move forward all night
four nine and nine okay put the knight

624
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
four nine and nine okay put the knight
 

625
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,590
four nine and nine okay put the knight
here and then move it to

626
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
here and then move it to
 

627
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,790
here and then move it to
both again nine and nine right you see

628
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
both again nine and nine right you see
 

629
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,189
both again nine and nine right you see
so it handles the duplicate numbers

630
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
so it handles the duplicate numbers
 

631
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,910
so it handles the duplicate numbers
perfectly got it okay

632
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920

 

633
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,269

define okay let's just do it f a

634
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
define okay let's just do it f a
 

635
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,629
define okay let's just do it f a
b what's missing column okay

636
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
b what's missing column okay
 

637
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,189
b what's missing column okay
a dot source okay we're sorting this

638
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
a dot source okay we're sorting this
 

639
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,829
a dot source okay we're sorting this
what's the time complexity of sorting

640
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
what's the time complexity of sorting
 

641
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,360
what's the time complexity of sorting
array

642

we talked about this before suit yeah

648
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
we talked about this before suit yeah
 

649
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,990
we talked about this before suit yeah
yeah okay

650
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000

 

651
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,509

and answer equals we're putting these

652
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
and answer equals we're putting these
 

653
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,990
and answer equals we're putting these
the common elements in the array okay

654
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
the common elements in the array okay
 

655
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,710
the common elements in the array okay
then look

656
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
then look
 

657
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,750
then look
i equals z equals zero right

658
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:33,760
i equals z equals zero right
 

659
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,949
i equals z equals zero right
they're pointing what's i equals z

660
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
they're pointing what's i equals z
 

661
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,949
they're pointing what's i equals z
equals zero what does it mean

662
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
equals zero what does it mean
 

663
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,470
equals zero what does it mean
i is zero j is zero what's iron what's

664
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
i is zero j is zero what's iron what's
 

665
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:55,670
i is zero j is zero what's iron what's
j we

666
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680

 

667
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,790

so what does it mean here

668
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800

 

669
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,389

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000
a b equals l a
 

673
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:25,189
a b equals l a
l b yeah please

674
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199

 

675
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,990

you don't listen next a b equals look we

676
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
you don't listen next a b equals look we
 

677
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,949
you don't listen next a b equals look we
talk about this

678
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
talk about this
 

679
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,069
talk about this
a b equals 1 1 1

680
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
a b equals 1 1 1
 

681
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,710
a b equals 1 1 1
2 what does it mean a equals 1 b

682
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720

 

683
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,069

b here it means what a equals a

684
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079

 

685
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,590

okay so it's the length of that okay

686
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
okay so it's the length of that okay
 

687
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,509
okay so it's the length of that okay
then now we can do this

688
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
then now we can do this
 

689
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,189
then now we can do this
y i smaller than l a

690
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199

mean
 

701
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,310
mean
what does this mean i smaller than l a

702
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
what does this mean i smaller than l a
 

703
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,749
what does this mean i smaller than l a
and j smaller than

704
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
and j smaller than
 

705
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,189
and j smaller than
b wire then you move it so

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,350
why any of these are not are still
in the range yeah okay if

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
in the range yeah okay if
 

711
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,629

714
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
b j what should i do
 

715
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,870
b j what should i do
if less than equal what should i do even

716
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:28,880
if less than equal what should i do even

but before that
 

723
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:43,460

okay so shorter ai is smaller than bj

744
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
okay so shorter ai is smaller than bj

okay so shorter ai is smaller than bj
what i see

746

753
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:56,070

755
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,620

all n plus m okay
 

767
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,350
all n plus m okay
yeah equal sorry what did that equal

768
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
yeah equal sorry what did that equal
 

769
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,270
yeah equal sorry what did that equal
good question so look this part of

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
good question so look this part of

the small one smaller smaller part which
 

795
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,909
the small one smaller smaller part which
is this pie

796
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:53,919
is this pie
 

797
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,029
is this pie
this is smaller than this yeah yeah so

798
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
this is smaller than this yeah yeah so
 

799
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,190

831
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,029
trivial right
yeah if we don't need the sorting then

832
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
yeah if we don't need the sorting then
 

833
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,070
yeah if we don't need the sorting then

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,510
yeah so so for our uh accurate
complexity

842
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
complexity
 

843
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,029
complexity
we always pick the most time consuming

844
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
we always pick the most time consuming
 

845
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:53,590
we always pick the most time consuming
power

846
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
power
 

847
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,630
power
right yes and we discard the

848
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
right yes and we discard the
 

849
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,830
right yes and we discard the
constant right all right o2 n is the

850
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840
constant right all right o2 n is the
 

851
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,549
constant right all right o2 n is the
same as o

852
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
same as o
 

853
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,669
same as o
n or a hundred n is the same as o n

854
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:03,679
n or a hundred n is the same as o n
 

855
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,070
n or a hundred n is the same as o n
got it because a 100 is the constant

856
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
got it because a 100 is the constant
 

857
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,270
got it because a 100 is the constant
okay

858
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
okay
 

859
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,310
okay
yes uh so

860
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
yes uh so
 

861
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,669
yes uh so
okay so this is the pretty much for

862
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
okay so this is the pretty much for
 

863
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,230
okay so this is the pretty much for
today

864
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
today
 

865
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,549
today
i'm going to erase one uh one of it okay

866
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
i'm going to erase one uh one of it okay
 

867
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,470
i'm going to erase one uh one of it okay
so let's see

868
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
so let's see
 

869
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,149
so let's see

you're not looking you're not looking
you're not okay i'm raising erasing here

872
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
you're not okay i'm raising erasing here
 

873
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,630
you're not okay i'm raising erasing here
okay

874
