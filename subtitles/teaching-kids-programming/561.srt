1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:08,700
okay so we're given the integer I want

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,120
to transform that to something on the

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,340
right so basically we extract each digit

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,980
and you see five two three five minus

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,619
two plus three equals six three two one

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,720
zero three minus two plus one minus zero

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,760
one just one one two three one minus two

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,320
plus three equals two it doesn't have to

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,560
be minus plus

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,500
that's right yes so the leftmost we call

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,540
it the most uh significant digit okay

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,700
most significant digit on the left right

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,040
because this is the most significant at

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,800
least one is this one on the right hand

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,079
side this is one right these are the

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,300
least significant digits

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,539
okay so we start with most significant

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,899
digit always with plus one and the next

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,120
and the next digit is -1 and the next

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,059
digit is plus one again so alternative

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,980
sine digit okay so we just want to know

22
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,079
the sum what's your thoughts about it

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,539
are you given the number on the left

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,760
yeah I will not get this number on the

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,180
right you only have like one choice like

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,659
minus plus minus plus yeah one choice

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,520
yes yeah yeah and so you're giving given

28
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,200
the one the number on the left and

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,960
you're trying to give the number on the

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,479
right that's right yes okay I feel

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,780
confess it and then so what's your sauce

32
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,780
okay

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,020
I think we're done

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,240
so it's easy

35
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,860
easy it's simulation it's basically

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,880
doing what you're told right so you're

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,880
basically

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,880
okay

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,960
how do we extract each digit so you

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,200
start with the first first number which

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,579
you said is the most significant digit

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,579
and then for every two numbers every two

43
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,399
numbers leave every two digits you

44
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,880
subtract that digit okay and then for

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,560
others we add it yeah okay okay so my

46
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,239
question was more like how do you get

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,340
the five how do you get the two how do

48
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,900
you get the three and then there are two

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,400
ways right you can start from the left

50
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,760
to the right or you can start from right

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,420
to the left right which one is better

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,379
from the left to the right I think it's

53
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:30,420
tiver it depends on what or or what the

54
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:32,400
number is like moderate I think yes but

55
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,319
I'm saying that okay so five two three

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,459
you start from the left to the right or

57
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,319
you start from the right to the left

58
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,599
that's what I'm saying left you right

59
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,780
left to the right end

60
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,360
he says we're left I think it I think

61
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,640
left to right is how you do it because

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,400
English you like read it like that way

63
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,500
but and also you said it's the most

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,780
significant yeah yeah

65
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,640
right yeah okay so that's what I want to

66
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,920
know yeah because five two three yeah

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,620
always start with the positive right so

68
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,480
you know intuitively yeah five two three

69
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,239
we start from the left to the right

70
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,220
there are only two choice if it's even

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,540
number of digits or if it's the odd

72
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,400
number of these right you don't know

73
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,739
which one is it

74
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,360
all right so you can still do it from

75
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,400
left to the right as long as we come

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,019
release into

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,300
string

78
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,940
so with the string then I can cut each

79
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,159
digit we can also do it from right to

80
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,959
the left but the problem with the right

81
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,840
to the left is that you don't know which

82
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,000
one you know if you five two three these

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,400
three this is one this is plus one and

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,180
this is past right but if it's five two

85
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,920
three four this will be minus right plus

86
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,739
minus

87
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,299
plus minus MRI if you start from the

88
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,379
right to the left but you're not sure

89
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:51,540
which one is the least significant digit

90
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,400
right but why do we need to care about

91
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,099
starting from right to the left because

92
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,040
it's easy to do the math modulus right

93
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,120
look five two three four how do we get

94
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,140
the four

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,140
models by 10. multiply 10 and then

96
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,879
divided by 10. how do we get a three

97
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,239
modules by ten

98
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,280
divided by 10 modules by 10 divided by

99
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,160
10. let's do this uh the first approach

100
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,100
using the converting to the string as

101
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,620
equal if the number is uh defined okay f

102
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,460
n okay and then this needs to return

103
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,800
integer Type S equals Str we convert it

104
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,360
to a string answer equals elevation zero

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,699
sine

106
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,620
plus one minus one right so at the

107
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,919
beginning is plus one yeah

108
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,360
for I in s

109
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,919
answer

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:47,580
plus equal and the plus equal I I this

111
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,360
is the string we cover T2 integer

112
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,160
converted to integer yeah times

113
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,180
sign

114
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,699
okay yeah I learned I need to make plus

115
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,220
one two minus one how do I neglect The

116
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,720
Sign Plus make it minus if it's minus I

117
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,220
want to make a plus how do I do this

118
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,080
sign equals what

119
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:12,199
uh equals minus minus sign

120
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,780
oh sign

121
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,460
equals sine times equal minus one one

122
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,919
times minus one

123
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,919
is minus one and minus one times minus

124
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:28,080
one is one and then we turn

125
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:30,419
and look if the number n has n digit and

126
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,820
digit the time complexity we're going

127
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:35,039
through each one so o n

128
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,880
phase complexity we need to convert it

129
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,160
to a string and this is O and Y if n is

130
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,419
the number of digits okay number of

131
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,479
digits

132
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:48,539
yeah so n is the number of digits then

133
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,220
it's block 10 face the N right look

134
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:52,979
because block one two three four how

135
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,699
many digits four digits so one two three

136
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:58,740
four is the inner scale of log ten one

137
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,740
two three four okay

138
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:06,300
n is the number of digits and log 10

139
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:09,180
base 10. block 10 100 what's this number

140
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,120
10 to the what power equals a hundred

141
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,360
two two not ten a hundred equals two

142
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,680
okay mixes okay the other way we're

143
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,680
going through the number from the right

144
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,020
to the left okay okay so that's a trick

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
to do this

146
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,160
that's a trick with tourists okay

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,840
previously I was talking about that we

148
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,300
are not sure that this significant digit

149
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,240
if it's the plus or minus right yeah

150
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:37,020
yeah yeah okay how about let's try with

151
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:41,100
minus one one two three four okay yeah

152
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:44,280
minus four plus three minus two plus one

153
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,340
and if I add another digit minus five

154
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,979
plus four minus three plus two minus one

155
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,680
minus one plus one minus one plus one so

156
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:54,660
plus one and the last one minus one plus

157
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,340
one minus one plus one minus one this is

158
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,280
one two three four yeah the answer

159
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,039
should be one minus two plus three minus

160
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,319
four this is equals to minus two okay

161
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:07,080
this is the answer this is correct and

162
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,000
the sign is plus one one minus two okay

163
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm confused

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,979
one minus two plus three two two and

165
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:20,220
five one two three four five seven seven

166
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:23,180
minus one seven minus two this is seven

167
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:28,259
why is it seven hundred

168
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:30,720
this is one this is one one so this is

169
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:34,560
three okay I know what we get from here

170
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,780
seven minus one minus one minus three

171
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,479
plus two minus one that's minus four

172
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,819
minus two minus three okay

173
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,380
okay so look if we are always starting

174
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:49,919
with the minus one on the least

175
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,360
significant digit for the odd number of

176
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,660
digit number

177
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,060
we need to we need to negate this right

178
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,759
so but it's okay because at the end the

179
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,880
sign is minus one we just need to fix

180
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,680
the Sun by times the sun okay does it

181
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,780
make sense yeah

182
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,300
yeah okay let me repeat okay this is a

183
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,340
little bit tricky tricky let's have a

184
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,039
little strategy okay let's start with

185
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,919
minus one from the right to the left so

186
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,180
this equals to minus two plus one

187
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,180
okay

188
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,599
this is minus one if we have another

189
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,120
value with the three digit one two three

190
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,220
this is minus three plus two minus one

191
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
this is minus two

192
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,219
okay

193
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,560
but the answer for this one should be

194
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:38,219
one minus two plus three this would be

195
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,320
two all right but we get minus two

196
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,060
but that's okay

197
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,219
we want to change the minus two to two

198
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,980
we need just need to fix the sign by

199
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:51,060
times the other side sine look

200
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,860
minus one plus one minus one times sun

201
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,019
when you turn this okay and how about

202
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,420
this one minus one

203
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:59,399
plus one when you still need to fix the

204
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,980
Sun but it's okay because minus one

205
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,180
times one equals one so we times percent

206
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,640
okay

207
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,620
so the strategy is that we start from

208
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,360
the least significant digit from right

209
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,480
to the left and we keep tracking of the

210
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,060
sun sun star is minus one plus one minus

211
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,640
one plus one and at the end we just have

212
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:21,000
to fix the sign by multiplying the

213
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,160
answer to the side does it make sense

214
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,820
we can do this uh look from right to the

215
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:30,180
left okay F and N is a digit it needs to

216
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,820
return the integer I answer equals zero

217
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:36,480
so at the beginning we set it one but we

218
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:40,019
immediately times it to minus one wire

219
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,000
and it's bigger than zero answer plus

220
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,279
equal

221
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,500
sign okay I need to change the sign sine

222
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,540
equals minus sign right

223
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,399
at the beginning is one and we are

224
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,800
starting from right to the left so you

225
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,680
immediately become minus one okay

226
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,260
sign

227
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,760
times N I want to get this n number one

228
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,700
two three I want to get this three how

229
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,920
do we get it us more do you understand

230
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,760
and then we need to get rid of sweet how

231
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,760
do we get rid of it

232
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,480
divided by 10 and then okay now we get

233
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,860
this now this answer we need to

234
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,019
return

235
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:24,779
answer times sine right okay this is the

236
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:27,420
last step to fix the sign okay this is

237
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:29,040
from right to the left yeah

238
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,540
time complexity

239
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,440
oh

240
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:37,800
and space come back to be first

241
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,440
uh one a one okay or one because there's

242
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,360
no arrays you know we're given n we just

243
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,519
have a few variables or one the time

244
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,279
till next day it's hard

245
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,940
at least not so what are we doing with

246
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:53,220
this end look at one two three four five

247
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,899
what's and look we just get rid of this

248
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,320
video get rid of this did you get rid of

249
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:00,260
this the end digit right so it's o n is

250
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,060
it simple

251
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:06,839
but you need to tell me what's the end

252
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,220
if we did and usually itself is well one

253
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,019
when you say oh one you don't need to

254
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,180
say and because there's no letter but

255
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,579
when you say o n you need to tell me

256
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,360
what n is n could be anything

257
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:21,720
n is n okay and N is the number of

258
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,339
digits in decimal format of of this

259
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,380
number for example one two three four

260
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:28,620
and N is four

261
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,959
because what are we doing here is

262
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,459
get the least significant digit get rid

263
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,160
of it you don't need to explain because

264
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:38,279
they all you need to know is o n

265
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,740
now use o n when you say o n it's just

266
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,320
50 percent when I ask you what's the

267
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,940
time complexity you say o n but I don't

268
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,399
know what n is you need to tell me what

269
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,019
n is n is the number of Digit I think

270
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,620
you know what n is because you written

271
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:54,120
no I could be anything okay okay

272
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,240
this is oh and it's the number of days

273
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,380
required okay so he said it is the

274
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:04,040
number of digits yes

275
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,040
divided by 10 okay

276
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,420
or you don't convert it to string this

277
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,760
is all mathematics right all numbers all

278
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,579
numbers numbers numbers

279
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,860
number we get the digit by modulus so

280
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:18,720
it's all numbers the thing here is we

281
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,399
need to multiply the sign as I said this

282
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,680
is a tricky way from right to the left

283
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,320
but from the left to the right we can

284
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,360
convert it to a string and get each

285
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,680
digit right and then we convert it to a

286
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,260
string and then we need to convert it

287
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,860
back using the in in I block two is

288
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,720
usually for binary 15. in binary is one

289
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,300
one one right you know that right and if

290
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,880
we want to go through the digit in

291
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,440
binary format is one one one and the

292
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,660
time conversation usually in this case

293
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,320
is

294
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:51,060
locked

295
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:54,959
n and log base 2 and N is the number is

296
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:57,660
15. log base n now this four in binary

297
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,600
one one one okay every time we get one

298
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,940
we shift it make sense yeah yeah what

299
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,279
have you learned today numbers and we're

300
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,279
doing some stuff sounds

301
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,019
plus minus plus minus

302
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:18,779
antique on all the digits and and then

303
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,000
we're getting the sound we're done and

304
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:22,700
then how can we do it uh usually how

305
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
many ways we learned how to do it today

306
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,860
what are those uh from left to right and

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,320
right to it yeah and which one you think

308
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,779
is better that's right

309
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,959
it's easy to implement but which one is

310
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:39,380
more efficient in terms of space

311
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:39,380
why because

312
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,399
complexity for the left to the right

313
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:50,220
oh

314
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,800
oh we need to convert it to a string so

315
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,240
our end what's the space n is the number

316
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,120
of digits okay what's the space

317
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,620
complexity for right to the left one so

318
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,779
which one is better

319
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,139
right left because the one is better

320
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:07,200
than om right both uh time complexity is

321
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:09,240
o n the L is the number of digits in the

322
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,880
in the taximal format of n okay let's

323
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,680
see for today bye-bye goodbye hello bye

324
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,399
bye

325
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,399
foreign
