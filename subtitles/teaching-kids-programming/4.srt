okay hello okay please

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,840
today i'm going to talk about the data

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,719
structure called stack

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,719
do you know stack

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,760
can anyone describe what is the stack

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,039
it's a tower it's a towel can you draw

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,400
it somewhere

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,400
color okay

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,280
eric you want to draw

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,040
tower okay and lots of things yeah

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,040
yesterday

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,040
um loads of houses windows

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,399
okay yeah yeah yeah okay

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,760
okay let's that's why it was mean by

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,680
state yeah

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,160
okay similar similar so a stack is uh

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,000
it's uh it's probably simply a stack is

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,719
the data structure we call it data

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,359
structure

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:02,320
data structure so data structure is

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,600
is a kind of structure to hold data yeah

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,799
to hold data

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,640
so this stack is actually it's it's

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,000
quite similar to what you have

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,560
put here but it's like it's an

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,560
a list it's a it's uh

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,000
so so for example like if you put a

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,080
plate

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,840
yeah you can put a bigger plate yeah

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,840
put a big plate

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,430
[Music]

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,520
okay okay you do a better job okay

34
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,759
coward okay okay come

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:53,119
yes yes okay so the point here is

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,720
i put a plate on top of each other but i

37
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,159
every time i want to take a play which

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,360
played i take the first

39
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,920
the top one right yes i cannot take

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,719
these

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,520
right without taking these and that yeah

42
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,600
yeah

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,760
okay so so so this is one property of uh

44
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,959
one important one important thing about

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,080
a step is

46
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:21,280
is what first thing

47
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:24,319
first in last out

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,599
okay we call it

49
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,599
first thing you have now the plate look

50
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,440
you put the plate you put this plate

51
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,959
first you put the second plate you put

52
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,480
the third plate when you take it out you

53
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,879
take the three first

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,760
and then you take the second you take it

55
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,640
the second

56
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,840
and then the last take you take the one

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,239
out okay

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,440
okay so the first thing lasts off so in

59
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,280
person

60
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,800
in person we can do this we can do this

61
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,760
like let's let's let's call it

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,560
let's call it what plate okay let's call

63
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,640
it plate

64
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,840
plate when we define what we can do

65
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,040
equals what a bracket yeah

66
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,680
empty so first of all it's empty okay

67
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,519
so now what i want to do is i want to

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,360
put one plate first

69
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,720
so plate stop

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,879
append yeah

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,920
what's the meaning of a pen describe

72
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,840
append describe a pen

73
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,239
no yes it's quite open what's it what

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,239
does it mean

75
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,280
to put something yeah put something at

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,440
the end

77
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,879
okay so what does it what does it mean

78
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,239
here so one is

79
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,599
one is when a statement gets executed

80
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:49,040
ryan ryan listen eric

81
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:53,840
these plates will contain one

82
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,720
okay okay and then after this place

83
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
dot a pen

84
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,560
two now what will it happen it will put

85
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,360
this

86
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,959
two at the end of the this data

87
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,400
structure yeah

88
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,760
two okay and then again i can put this

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,080
three

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,879
and then what happened it will become a

91
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,040
three

92
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,440
okay now this is interesting part how

93
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,639
about i do this

94
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,600
play stop pop

95
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,160
so what do you think pop and then i get

96
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
the x

97
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,160
i assign it to x so what do you think

98
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,520
what happened

99
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,400
what do you think what happened here pop

100
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,080
a pen pop pop is like to take it out so

101
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,120
what happens they

102
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,080
will damage you take

103
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,960
the biggest number out no no first thing

104
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,080
that's all

105
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,280
first thing that's off so i i put it

106
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,800
first one

107
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,960
two three so this one is the first thing

108
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,639
in right yeah so it should be the last

109
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,520
style so what should be coming

110
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,360
in first sit down otherwise three three

111
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,120
yes good job so x

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,160
will become three left one

113
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,000
and look look like eric i

114
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,240
think it's pop what is the meaning of

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,720
pop

116
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:18,080
take out okay so this will be gone

117
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,770
okay and x will be three okay

118
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,360
yeah so then let's try again place

119
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,960
[Music]

120
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,600
the append four

121
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:34,240
what happened what happened

122
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,880
you put the four leg yeah you put four

123
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,560
here

124
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,440
okay all right

125
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,520
and then again i thought this y equals

126
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,080
place

127
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,080
the pop

128
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,680
after this okay why because playing

129
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,160
support what happened

130
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,840
y equals place the pop so what happened

131
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,880
now

132
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,440
the y is four y

133
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,039
is four yeah we're done and this will be

134
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,720
erased from the

135
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,039
stack right from the plate got it

136
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,960
yeah so if you keep doing that then the

137
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,319
next element to take out is two

138
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,520
yeah and the next element to get cut out

139
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,400
is one so next functions to c

140
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,120
to to check how many elements are in the

141
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,280
plate

142
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,600
in the stack do you know what it is why

143
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,680
do you have lens number four

144
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,080
length yeah we call it lens stands from

145
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,360
lens yeah you know the word lens

146
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,720
yes length is the size okay so length of

147
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,560
this plate

148
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,319
now it will become two right

149
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:48,000
yes okay okay so do you know

150
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,360
how about if you want to reverse a

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,360
list how do we do it reverse it

152
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,360
we can use this first in lassa okay

153
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:04,639
yeah look let's let's call this

154
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,250
define reverse okay

155
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,759
yeah say properly please reverse

156
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,120
[Music]

157
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,800
reverse let's let's for example numbers

158
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,720
at least the numbers okay the llamas

159
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,960
okay yeah so how do we do it

160
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,759
how do we do it it's numbers already i

161
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,120
know we want to reverse it

162
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,440
okay then we can do this let's call it

163
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,080
the

164
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,360
reverse is in the answer okay answer is

165
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,759
a list

166
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:42,800
okay so now what we can do

167
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,800
y length

168
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,039
numbers

169
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,319
is bigger than zero yeah even less

170
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,800
element in the list

171
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:56,000
what do we do we we

172
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,919
we take a value from the end from from

173
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,400
the end yeah from the

174
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,800
end which is lambs the pop am right

175
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,280
look now we take this for example the

176
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,560
numbers is one two three okay

177
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,800
now length lumps is three right

178
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,240
three is bigger than zero we pop it so

179
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,680
we take these three

180
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,639
make it one two and x is three right

181
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,319
then we do this answer dot append we

182
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,080
append it to this right

183
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,160
okay x and then it goes

184
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,160
long and the next one is two and then

185
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,199
the next answer will be three two and

186
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,440
the next one is one

187
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,839
three two one and then return what

188
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,880
written one we want to write down

189
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,600
x return x no no no

190
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,480
what we have to written answer we're

191
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600

we are creating a list and then we pop

198
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,160
it we check these numbers we pop it

199
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,000
when it's not empty we pop it we take

200
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,920
one animal from the end and then we

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,080
append it to the other list

202
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,839
and we return this okay and do we want

203
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,720
