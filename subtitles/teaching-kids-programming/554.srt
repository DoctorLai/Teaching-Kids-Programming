1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:07,560
right okay so we're given the numbers

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,200
array array of integers positive

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,219
negative and zero zeros are neither

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,940
positive nor negative right yeah so we

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,039
want to find out the maximum count of

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,140
the positive number of negative so

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,820
taking this uh for example like how many

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,220
positive numbers here

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,680
how many positive numbers

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,720
um

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,880
no I I was just saying that zeros are

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,540
not positive and are not negative okay

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,840
two okay so how many negative numbers

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,960
three okay so you need to tell me is

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,180
sweet is that easy it's very trivial

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,200
okay okay another example numbers equals

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,200
is a limit

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
negative

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,780
[Music]

20
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,400
we have to count the negative and

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,380
positive number and compare which one is

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,060
bigger basically this is what it is am I

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,979
right

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,159
you have to say negative or positive

25
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,159
yeah positive or negative we count yeah

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,840
we just count yeah how do we count

27
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,960
counter

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,860
uh we don't need them no the counter is

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,860
more like uh

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,159
now the counter is more like you want to

31
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,380
know how many times the number appears

32
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,299
right but here we just want to know how

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,420
many times a positive any positive

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,579
numbers or any negative numbers here oh

35
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,720
we can just go from the left to the

36
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,140
right

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,540
yeah should come right negative two

38
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,380
negative three negative okay three

39
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,399
negative

40
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:59,220
yellow zero we ignore positive positive

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,340
to annually compare why are you always

42
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:05,219
writing numbers which are sorted

43
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,899
that's a very good observation okay so

44
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,880
this is the proof of us right I didn't

45
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,099
tell you that it's salty right

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,780
that's very good very good yes I need

47
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,760
your eyes on this that's very good

48
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,739
actually if it's not salty if it's

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,780
unsalted that's the only way we can do

50
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,540
right it's a random the only way we can

51
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,239
check is go into all the numbers and

52
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,060
then just classify them right if it's a

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,420
positive just imagine there's a two

54
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,700
bucket if it's a positive plus one if

55
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,620
it's a negative a plus one if it's zero

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,840
so right away at the end we just compare

57
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,200
these two numbers right this is the case

58
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,420
when the level does yes the numbers are

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,040
unsorted right okay so let's quickly

60
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,080
write it it should be very easy right

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,300
okay and then think about how we can

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,879
improve it when it's sorted okay so look

63
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,700
positive equals zero negative equals

64
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:59,040
zero four I in numbers look

65
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:04,080
if p is positive

66
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:08,160
if I is positive P plus equal one L if L

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,220
if this is s if plus short for L if okay

68
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,560
and if I is smaller than zero negative

69
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,120
plus equal one and after we're going

70
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,319
through the all the numbers we just

71
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,480
return depend maximum if it's a p bigger

72
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,519
or and bigger this is Trivial right it

73
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,860
should be understand this in you know a

74
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,659
second a Time complexity

75
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,739
leave without a number what's the

76
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,440
temperature

77
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,540
oh well obviously we have to

78
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,760
finish seconding right that's today's

79
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,000
complexity a one right because we just

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,620
need a constant space okay excuse me to

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,980
sort it if I tell you these numbers

82
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,180
sorted in non-decreasing order so in

83
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,659
other words it's ascending

84
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,340
non-decreasing right

85
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,760
yellow yes why we look for geolog

86
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,760
because

87
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,900
that's good so what is sorted how we can

88
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,500
improve this uh we just I just we I just

89
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,099
can't go before go from beginning until

90
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,099
it's until it's positive or zero

91
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:14,040
and he is positive or zero which one the

92
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,380
country is you have to have zero

93
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,600
yes that could be zeros in there no but

94
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,820
do you have to what do you mean do you

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,380
have to yeah yeah because I have to have

96
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,320
is it right it doesn't have to have a

97
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,780
zero or can it notice if I'm negatives

98
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,020
it could be having a jealous you can't

99
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:34,199
make assumptions

100
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,780
when the negative ends it comes to zero

101
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,720
or another positive so if we delete

102
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,979
those two zeros with us we'll count

103
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,560
oh

104
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,479
if you let us know the ganza is the sin

105
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,240
and that's why I said that yellow is not

106
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,580
positive not negative yeah yeah

107
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,720
but the thing is um my point

108
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,540
is

109
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:00,080
do we have to have a zero in it

110
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,080
do we have had to chill in the uh

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,300
you can say yes

112
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,940
so we have to if it hasn't then then it

113
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,560
will turn to positive yeah of course but

114
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,380
the answer is still the same

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,199
yeah I know yeah but you're you're

116
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,780
thinking about the answer changing but

117
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,199
what I'm talking about is how when we're

118
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,199
negative

119
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:28,800
and it either stops at zero or another

120
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:31,620
positive okay so yes I understand your

121
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,699
point now but so you need to tell me a

122
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,919
way that works for both cases if the

123
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:41,220
zeros in there or if the deals are not

124
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,380
in there so if the array is sorted if

125
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,020
numbers are sorted if we meet the

126
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,419
positive we just stop can we because we

127
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,000
don't need to continue so with scan scan

128
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:53,300
scan we check check check okay it's a

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,300
positive

130
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,820
we don't need to count the rest we don't

131
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,000
need to continue suppose look yeah minus

132
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,100
one zero one two three

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,699
up to a minute

134
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,520
I mean how many zeros okay okay so here

135
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:14,280
this is a very extreme cases okay so now

136
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,300
now I'm telling you

137
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,360
okay okay thank you for correction okay

138
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,539
thank you so look the number of the

139
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,539
numbers in the array is a million and

140
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:29,940
two right very specific Facebook okay

141
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,979
this is the total number assume you can

142
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,440
get this number you know how many

143
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,539
numbers in the number in the array right

144
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,880
this is the number okay so do I need to

145
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:42,240
finish counting tier list no look

146
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,319
negative negative number

147
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,600
one

148
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,240
zero ignore

149
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,220
one it's positive so how do we calculate

150
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,639
the number of positive numbers

151
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,940
I know I already visit two numbers so so

152
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,819
for it's just like forever was it called

153
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,280
like the maze thing like you plus one

154
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:05,940
and the one time you tell us like plus

155
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,940
one minus one so for the negative we may

156
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,759
be minus one and and then for the

157
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,180
positively plus one

158
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:18,000
uh okay

159
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:21,900
because look let's say you have those

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,440
yeah you you have a negative yeah

161
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,500
whatever and a positive so when you have

162
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,979
something like I don't know

163
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:34,759
this and so when you mean minus one you

164
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,759
minus one

165
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:41,580
and then when you

166
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,220
um okay so so you start with zero as

167
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:48,060
always and then and then you minus one

168
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:50,520
two minus one and and then and then and

169
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,919
then you meet a zero and when you meet a

170
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,740
zero it's it's still the same and then

171
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,419
the next must be positive and then it

172
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,280
makes it a zero and then another

173
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,380
positive is one and you don't need to

174
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,240
count there because because you know all

175
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,280
the rest are going to be positive so

176
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,259
look I already counted two

177
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,699
right and then now I have a positive

178
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,919
number

179
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,960
I already counted two which is like are

180
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,880
not positive number and I know total

181
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,440
numbers how many positive numbers

182
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,900
there are two numbers which you are not

183
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,099
positive and I told the numbers in the

184
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,500
array so how many different numbers

185
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,539
simple math a million that's right a

186
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,220
million and two minus two right this is

187
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,800
what I'm saying right so because look

188
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,479
I've counted this and then I made the

189
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,459
first positive I don't need to continue

190
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,860
to the end this is a huge I can just do

191
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:37,440
a simple mess as long as we know this

192
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,419
number and normally this number is a one

193
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,120
we get this number one right

194
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,919
but some problem in language don't

195
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,440
provide these in order to know the

196
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,300
number of elements in the array you know

197
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,220
possibly what they do is that they count

198
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,860
it until the end that's very stupid way

199
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,360
right you can't imagine how stupid this

200
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,700
computer is now

201
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,620
you know if it has to count each number

202
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,540
to know how many numbers right normally

203
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,519
this is not the case normally there will

204
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,040
be a counter somewhere saying okay how

205
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,660
many uh how many numbers in the array

206
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,000
and then if we add one more number we'll

207
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,380
just add the this counter or we take a

208
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,660
number out there with decremental

209
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,940
counter so this is uh one simple way so

210
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,399
we can just improve this right so uh

211
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,440
negative equals zero total equals the

212
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,320
length of the array right negative

213
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,560
equals zero right now positive let's say

214
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,640
at the beginning we said to nine four I

215
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,540
in

216
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,779
numbers right if I is smaller than zero

217
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,040
the negative plus equal one right here

218
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,700
if

219
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,220
if I is bigger than zero if we meet the

220
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,519
first positive number so in this case

221
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,100
the positive equals what the total

222
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,399
right okay so we need to know the index

223
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,519
right so I V in illuminate right you

224
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,660
know this function right you numer like

225
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,399
illuminated function and then we need to

226
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,240
change this to V

227
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:03,000
V the I is the indexes of zero this is

228
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,640
the zero this is one Index this is two

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,339
so we need to minus this one right so P

230
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,380
equals total minus I this is Index right

231
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,420
and then we need to break we don't need

232
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,580
to continue here this is the the

233
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,620
optimization we need to break right we

234
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,399
need to play and return this is the same

235
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,200
return maximum p and v okay the time

236
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,240
comma x t come on this is a tricky one

237
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,620
we have a third Improvement the time

238
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,420
from next day when we talk about the

239
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,399
time complexity we always talk about in

240
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,500
the worst case so what's the times I'm

241
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,399
listing

242
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,010
oh

243
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,600
be brave say it out

244
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,180
[Music]

245
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,300
in worst case what could be in the worst

246
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,300
case

247
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,120
no in in the worst

248
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,459
in the worst case

249
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,279
these optimization slight optimization

250
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:56,760
is not useful at all when

251
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,980
they know positive number right if there

252
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,019
is no positive number it's the same as

253
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,800
the previous one so the time complexity

254
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,800
is

255
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,779
oh and oh and because in the worst case

256
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,180
you still have to go through each

257
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,880
numbers when there is no positive number

258
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,519
right okay so this optimization may not

259
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,680
work please optimization works if like

260
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,060
there are lots of the

261
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,360
positive numbers

262
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,700
right like this we just count two and

263
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,279
then we can exit oh we're given is

264
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,860
sorted arrays one algorithm we can think

265
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,899
of is what kind of ignorant we need to

266
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,120
think you know one we're given something

267
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,420
sorted we need to think one algorithm

268
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,040
which is like Ryan you talk about

269
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,720
finding zero zero is a very important

270
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,480
part so look

271
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:48,079
this number right minus five minus four

272
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,079
minus 3 0 1 100 a million

273
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,920
so we want to find the zeros here these

274
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,260
are very exotic so how do we find it

275
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,459
because it's sorted

276
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,459
sorry we can

277
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,660
binary

278
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,180
gas

279
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,940
spinosis yes exactly yeah yeah if we can

280
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,760
finally search we can reduce the

281
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,920
complexity from o n to O log n guessing

282
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,019
the number not example I've given you

283
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,920
many many times I have a number in my

284
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,140
head

285
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,480
and I can't tell you you get the number

286
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,899
what's your story is it 50 okay the

287
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,579
number in my head is smaller 25 okay

288
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:29,640
you're not a strategy you're always cut

289
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:31,980
in half when look so I have a number a

290
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,140
zero to a hundred and then you guess the

291
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,339
in the meter right if it's a

292
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,579
figure

293
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:42,360
you guess from 51 to 100 if it's smaller

294
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:45,240
it gets from zero to 49 right every time

295
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,800
you walk you abandon half of it you

296
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,680
don't need to check any numbers here

297
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,139
right your abundant half of it so let's

298
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,120
improve the speed right like cut the

299
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:56,760
search space into half right so we can

300
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,860
finally search right and we can find and

301
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,380
search the zero this is very important

302
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,600
but we need to understand how to win

303
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,160
final research the zero we talked about

304
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,079
five seconds five seconds left and

305
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,839
biceps right right we talked about that

306
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:11,160
probably 200 days ago

307
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,139
okay

308
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:18,660
one example okay five seven left

309
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:21,720
five set

310
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,060
right find the search okay we can

311
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,760
Implement search but the python function

312
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,820
is this one when the item we are looking

313
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,380
for in a sorted array does not exist

314
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,660
these two function Returns the same

315
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:38,940
thing when it's not exist okay so look

316
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:41,820
zero one two two two two three I have

317
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,399
lots of tools right so if I'm saying

318
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,040
that I want to buy set that the numbers

319
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,100
right this is numbers

320
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,320
okay numbers

321
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,160
okay and I want to find the two where is

322
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,519
the two

323
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:59,220
okay look I want to find the two

324
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,860
but I said left and right works on the

325
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,839
salty the lumbars needs to be sorted and

326
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,940
then you're looking for two looking for

327
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,480
two so five and left you will return

328
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:12,060
this position this is five set left

329
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,940
it means that this is the position that

330
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,720
you can put the new another tool to make

331
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,720
it salty right

332
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:24,660
is here look here this is the difference

333
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,399
so first advice is that when you put

334
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,220
this partition here

335
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,380
why is salted okay this is a new index

336
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,000
okay

337
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,540
yeah

338
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,540
so

339
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:44,639
minus five minus four minus three zero

340
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:47,040
zero zero one two three okay so look

341
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,100
we're looking for pi set left

342
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,980
is here please position price and right

343
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,740
is this one okay so look

344
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,720
if we do divisor left faster than how

345
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,040
many negative numbers

346
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,040
yeah all right

347
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,180
how many positive numbers

348
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:08,639
how many positive numbers this bit but

349
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,980
we know this Index right we know it is

350
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,139
index so we know how many total numbers

351
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,260
the minus the spices right and then

352
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:19,860
that's it okay makes sense so simple

353
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:23,160
right this end is this total total

354
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:27,839
equals the length of the numbers

355
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:31,199
okay the negative number equals five set

356
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,420
left the numbers

357
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:37,279
zero this is the number of negative

358
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:39,600
numbers and positive number equals total

359
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,459
minus 5 set

360
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,959
right

361
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:45,480
numbers

362
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,160
zero and then we can

363
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,220
maximum

364
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,440
negative positive this speed is the same

365
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,279
okay one two three four four lines of

366
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,740
code

367
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,959
and the time complexity oh look n plus o

368
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:02,040
log n two

369
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:04,680
login oh login plus o login equals o log

370
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,980
n times two we drop the constant so it's

371
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,540
O log n okay the first approach oh n the

372
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,260
second approach is n the third position

373
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,300
which one is better which one is faster

374
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,740
okay

375
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:20,160
the first approach you know some people

376
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,680
might write it as one return in a

377
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,180
maximum all right you can say some I

378
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:30,120
smaller than zero for I in numbers all

379
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:33,720
right this is to count how many negative

380
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,300
numbers and some I bigger than zero for

381
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,940
IE numbers right but the problem of this

382
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,100
is that the max function requires two

383
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,320
parameters here we need to go through

384
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,660
the array twice right so you go to one

385
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,339
array once to find out how many are

386
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,079
negative numbers you go through another

387
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,920
time to find out the positive number so

388
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:54,899
it's actually o n plus n which is o2n we

389
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,820
drop the constant even the time

390
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,800
complexity is still on the performance

391
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,540
is worse than the first as you remember

392
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,100
we just go through it away and we have

393
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,480
counter to count how many are negative

394
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,860
numbers how many are positive number

395
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,020
right it's just single person all right

396
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,020
okay so what have you learned

397
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:16,679
these numbers and there's a range of

398
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,620
negative and positive numbers but then

399
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,079
we're supposed to counter the negative

400
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,000
and positive numbers and then the most

401
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,839
popular

402
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,380
positive or negative number we we return

403
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:35,100
the clarity of positive or negative

404
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,440
number and also zero zero doesn't count

405
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,020
so we can just program a bin

406
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,559
okay good so what kind of equivalent can

407
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,559
we use here

408
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,000
the only if the numbers are in order

409
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,440
yeah even they are not in order we can

410
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,160
prove us from the left to the right

411
00:17:52,440 --> 00:18:00,080
right yes okay right on your turn

412
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,080
to learn about that there's like

413
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,620
it's even negative

414
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,660
yes and sometimes somebody arrives yes I

415
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,059
know you want to find out the biggest

416
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,120
number we want to find out if there are

417
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:17,940
more positive numbers or negative

418
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,460
numbers right okay so if the numbers are

419
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,900
sorted what what can we do with it we

420
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,720
can basically

421
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,240
can't use that bicep thing and also we

422
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,880
could count the negative numbers and

423
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,760
then these quick maths that's true and

424
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,700
the pie set is finally first yeah so we

425
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,620
are buying a research of what

426
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,840
we want to find this but basically what

427
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,179
are we trying to do with the binaries

428
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,299
bicep thing we want to look for the

429
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,940
zeros right the left zeros and the light

430
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:50,820
zeros and based on the index but because

431
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,220
spacer left retains the index python

432
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,140
right it also Returns the index so we

433
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,919
can paste on the index to do the math

434
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,440
because bicep is by research takes a

435
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,240
long end time it's faster and the bicep

436
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,120
left and python right basically the same

437
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,220
if the element if the element is not

438
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,380
existent in a way right for example if

439
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,840
I'm looking for 0.5

440
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,940
if I are looking for serum for Thai uh

441
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,559
using python level right basically will

442
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,620
tell me it's here you don't need to make

443
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,860
a difference if the element is in the

444
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:25,770
array okay that's it for today bye bye

445
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,770
