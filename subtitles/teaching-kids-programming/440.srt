1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,080
go hello hello hello

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
yeah okay so we have given a few

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,240
integers yes like five seven six

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,400
four can you tell me that if it's a

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,400
consecutive yeah four five six seven

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,320
how about

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,160
seven

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,039
six

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,599
three

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,359
two no no why is that we've got two

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,000
three six seven one where's one

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,120
missing where's five

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,200
your butt okay seven

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,120
five six five

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,800
yes or no four by six seven

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,719
hey

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,239
okay so how can we achieve this how can

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,239
we do it first thing to do is do one

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,000
and then we check if the neighbors are

20
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,039
one different right

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,240
define

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,320
is consequences

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,320
how do you spread the sensitivity

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,320
consecute

25
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,240
yeah i'm right okay so

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,240
first of all nouns

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,840
and we just have to check

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,799
okay comma if the nums i

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,880
if it is not equal to nums

30
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,079
i minus 1 1

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,600
look

32
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,680
this number

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,520
if it's not equal to the previous number

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,680
plus what what number that will return

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,680
for

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,799
if this number is not equal to the

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,799
previous number

38
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,920
the previous number

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,160
was if after we saw that if this number

40
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,120
is not the same as the previous number

41
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,879
plus what plus one which number here one

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,959
one exactly that would be ten fourths

43
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,879
yeah

44
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,800
after all the check will return true

45
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,440
here

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,599
okay so look releasing

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,000
can be turned into one line because we

48
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,920
are checking look what what are we what

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,640
are we doing here we are checking

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,800
if for any violation yeah

51
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,120
okay everybody listen to me

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,599
we're checking for the violation

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,560
so it's the same thing as we return all

54
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,160
of it all conditions are satisfied or q1

55
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,840
remember

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,400
everybody

57
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,800
okay one how do we say

58
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,519
nums i o

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,319
if equals num

60
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,280
i minus one plus one

61
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,159
for

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,800
i

63
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,800
in range

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,800
one

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,840
can you explain to me

66
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,159
this one

67
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,440
return oh what's it all

68
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,159
uh oh

69
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,720
i mean everything everything needs to be

70
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,599
true here right so everything look numbs

71
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,040
i

72
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,040
this this is

73
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,280
if this is nums i and what's this numbs

74
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,440
i minus one what does it mean what's a

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,360
num time minus one

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,920
right

77
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,000
uh i minus one is like the one before

78
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,200
yeah so the numbers are should be the

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,360
nums

80
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,080
before it plus one for i in when you

81
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,959
start from one right yeah why start from

82
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,959
one

83
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,400
one two three four why we start from

84
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,840
here

85
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,920
this number should be the previous

86
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,239
number plus one this number should be

87
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,640
previous to normal plus one this number

88
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
should be previous number two okay all

89
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,080
right right

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,319
okay time convexity this one is o and

91
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,959
again this one is a one

92
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,560
so what's the overall time complexity

93
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,080
this one

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
this one

95
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
this one is o and again

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,080
this one is oven so what's the timer

97
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,799
velocity

98
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
yeah this one is dominating this one is

99
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,880
complex now this one yeah takes more

100
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,520
time yeah so we ignore this one huh yeah

101
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,320
space complexity a one we are not using

102
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
any

103
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,880
linears uh we are we're only using the

104
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,000
constant base right

105
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,759
now

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
okay

107
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,520
okay so what have you learned so far

108
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,520
today

109
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,560
can you tell me one sentence what have

110
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,720
you done today we have learned how to

111
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,639
you're turn first we learn how to

112
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
um

113
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,800
generate is consecutive

114
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,320
how about you right

115
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,320
i learned how to uh

116
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,759
check if

117
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:03,440
[Music]

118
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,440
and how do we do it what's the most

119
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,080
important thing salty and checking and

120
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,600
then this is keyword okay so apart from

121
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,120
this all keyword

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
there's another one can you guess what's

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,840
this meaning any

124
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,160
any of them so at least one of them

125
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,479
all means everything yeah exactly yeah

126
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,479
your english is better than mine

127
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,479
okay that's it for today bye bye

128
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,479
bye
