yes today we talk about
metric transport uh magic transpose

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:18,720
metric transport uh magic transpose
 

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,550
metric transport uh magic transpose
i didn't know that because i wasn't

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
i didn't know that because i wasn't

there pantry

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
there pantry
 

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,189
there pantry
magics what is magic i don't know

12
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
magics what is magic i don't know
 

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:25,589
magics what is magic i don't know
because

14
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
because
 

15
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:36,310
because
oh that is what you sleep on

16
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320

 

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,389

you can think of it as a two dimensional

18
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
you can think of it as a two dimensional
 

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,350
you can think of it as a two dimensional
array

20
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
array
 

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,389
array
so look this is a metric

22
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
so look this is a metric
 

23
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,470
so look this is a metric
okay so numbers like one two three

24
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
okay so numbers like one two three
 

25
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,670
okay so numbers like one two three
that's basically four

26
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
that's basically four
 

27
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,630
that's basically four
five six seven eight nine so there are

28
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
five six seven eight nine so there are
 

29
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,750
five six seven eight nine so there are
nine numbers

30
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
nine numbers
 

31
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,069
nine numbers
okay so in in python you can do it this

32
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
okay so in in python you can do it this
 

33
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,270
okay so in in python you can do it this
way you can have this

34
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
way you can have this
 

35
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,910
way you can have this
yeah this is a list but it's a

36
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
yeah this is a list but it's a
 

37
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,069
yeah this is a list but it's a
two-dimensional list yeah four

38
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
two-dimensional list yeah four
 

39
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,630
two-dimensional list yeah four
dimensional list it's three times three

40
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
dimensional list it's three times three
 

41
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,590
dimensional list it's three times three
metric because it's three rows three

42
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
metric because it's three rows three
 

43
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,229
metric because it's three rows three
columns

44
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
columns
 

45
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,070
columns
oh i know i know yeah

46
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
oh i know i know yeah
 

47
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,830
oh i know i know yeah
this is a whole bed there's six

48
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:11,840
this is a whole bed there's six
 

49
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,750
this is a whole bed there's six
okay okay think of learn as well okay

50
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
okay okay think of learn as well okay
 

51
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,749
okay okay think of learn as well okay
look and how about this one look

52
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
look and how about this one look
 

53
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,950
look and how about this one look
one two three and

54
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
one two three and
 

55
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,149
one two three and
four five six and then you can do a

56
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
four five six and then you can do a
 

57
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,550
four five six and then you can do a
uh impression you can do this yeah this

58
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
uh impression you can do this yeah this
 

59
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,990
uh impression you can do this yeah this
is a style with a list yeah

60
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
is a style with a list yeah
 

61
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,390
is a style with a list yeah
it's at least two lists a whole is

62
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
it's at least two lists a whole is
 

63
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,109
it's at least two lists a whole is
conceived

64
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
conceived
 

65
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,510
conceived
consists of two lists one is it consists

66
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
consists of two lists one is it consists
 

67
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,630
consists of two lists one is it consists
of three elements so

68
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
of three elements so
 

69
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,230
of three elements so
this is also a magic it is two times

70
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
this is also a magic it is two times
 

71
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,630
this is also a magic it is two times
three

72
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
three
 

73
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,950
three
match because it's two rows three

74
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
match because it's two rows three
 

75
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,469
match because it's two rows three
columns okay

76
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
columns okay
 

77
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,429
columns okay
so this is three columns zeros okay so

78
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
so this is three columns zeros okay so
 

79
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,190
so this is three columns zeros okay so
now we are transposing uh

80
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
now we are transposing uh
 

81
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,109
now we are transposing uh
transpose transpose what's this meaning

82
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119

can you guess okay sorry
i write it and then you tell me what it

88
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
i write it and then you tell me what it
 

89
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,630
i write it and then you tell me what it
is okay okay

90
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
is okay okay
 

91
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,510
is okay okay
okay so it's this uh okay so it's the

00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
okay so it's this uh okay so it's the
 

93
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,350
okay so it's this uh okay so it's the
same okay

94
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
same okay
 

95
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,190
same okay
but i will have this one five nine okay

but i will have this one five nine okay
 

97
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,430
but i will have this one five nine okay
and then two four three seven

98
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
and then two four three seven
 

99
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,190
and then two four three seven
six eight oh yeah okay so can you tell

100
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
six eight oh yeah okay so can you tell
 

101
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,869
six eight oh yeah okay so can you tell
me what's transpose

102
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
me what's transpose
 

103
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,670
me what's transpose
one two three four five six seven eight

104
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
one two three four five six seven eight
 

105
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,110
one two three four five six seven eight
nine

106
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
nine
 

107
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,309
nine
i guess then you basically go down

108
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
i guess then you basically go down
 

109
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,949
i guess then you basically go down
what do you mean go down so how do okay

110
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
what do you mean go down so how do okay
 

111
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:23,750
what do you mean go down so how do okay
so you

112
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
so you
 

113
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,150
so you
for this one it's it's less but how

114

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
this is original coordinate is one
 

173
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,510
this is original coordinate is one
two right out one two right

174
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
two right out one two right
 

175
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,629
two right out one two right
so it should be the same as in the

176
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
so it should be the same as in the
 

177
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,990
so it should be the same as in the
new new metric it should be 2 1 so 0 1

178
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
new new metric it should be 2 1 so 0 1
 

179
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,629
new new metric it should be 2 1 so 0 1
2 1 2 2 1 so it should be c sorry

180
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
2 1 2 2 1 so it should be c sorry
 

181
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,070
2 1 2 2 1 so it should be c sorry
1 0 1 2 2 1 is

182
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080

 

183
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,430

so for this one if the side if the rows

184
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
so for this one if the side if the rows
 

185
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,230
so for this one if the side if the rows
and the columns are the same yeah if the

186
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
and the columns are the same yeah if the
 

187
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,629
and the columns are the same yeah if the
rows

188
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
rows
 

189
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,909
rows
of columns if the size of the rows

190
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
of columns if the size of the rows
 

191
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,990
of columns if the size of the rows
and the column if it's a square okay if

192
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
and the column if it's a square okay if
 

193
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,710
and the column if it's a square okay if
it's a square metric

194
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
it's a square metric
 

195
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,029
it's a square metric
this is diagonal yeah you never change

196
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
this is diagonal yeah you never change
 

197
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,909
this is diagonal yeah you never change
yeah

198
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
yeah
 

199
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,029
yeah
oh yeah you never change and you just

200
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
oh yeah you never change and you just
 

201
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,070
oh yeah you never change and you just
swap it

202
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
swap it
 

203
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,230
swap it
so look two becomes small four becomes

204
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
so look two becomes small four becomes
 

205
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,230
so look two becomes small four becomes
two yeah yeah i'm saying that

206
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
two yeah yeah i'm saying that
 

207
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,790
two yeah yeah i'm saying that
if this is a square metric you just swap

208
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
if this is a square metric you just swap
 

209
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,350
if this is a square metric you just swap
it look

210
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
it look
 

211
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,310
it look
two and four swap three and seven swap

212
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
two and four swap three and seven swap
 

213
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,749
two and four swap three and seven swap
six and i swap

214
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
six and i swap
 

215
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,110
six and i swap
okay swap along these do you get it

216
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
okay swap along these do you get it
 

217
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,150
okay swap along these do you get it
okay yeah yeah yeah

218
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
okay yeah yeah yeah
 

219
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,350
okay yeah yeah yeah
for this one for any any of others

220
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
for this one for any any of others
 

221
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,870
for this one for any any of others
if it's not a square you can think of

222
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
if it's not a square you can think of
 

223
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,029
if it's not a square you can think of
this one so first of all if

224
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
this one so first of all if
 

225
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,070
this one so first of all if
these are two rows and three columns

226
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
these are two rows and three columns
 

227
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,749
these are two rows and three columns
and the target metric will be three

228
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
and the target metric will be three
 

229
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,110
and the target metric will be three
dollars and two columns

230
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
dollars and two columns
 

231
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,590
dollars and two columns
right right the size will be swapped

232
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
right right the size will be swapped
 

233
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,629
right right the size will be swapped
yeah

234
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
yeah
 

235
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,390
yeah
yeah it will be first of all you return

236
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
yeah it will be first of all you return
 

237
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,230
yeah it will be first of all you return
this way yeah yeah

238
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
this way yeah yeah
 

239
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,029
this way yeah yeah
and turn this way but if this if this

240
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
and turn this way but if this if this
 

241
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,909
and turn this way but if this if this
original here is it is one two

242
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
original here is it is one two
 

243
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,309
original here is it is one two
if it's a one two location and then it

244
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
if it's a one two location and then it
 

245
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,070
if it's a one two location and then it
should be in the new metric

246
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
should be in the new metric
 

247
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,710
should be in the new metric
it should be in the two one location got

248
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
it should be in the two one location got
 

249
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,309
it should be in the two one location got
it

250
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
it
 

251
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,430
it
yeah yeah okay okay okay so

252
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
yeah yeah okay okay okay so
 

253
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,029
yeah yeah okay okay okay so
how do we write this code

254
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039

 

255
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,270

transport of magic how do we write it

256
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280

 

257
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,870

define transpose

258
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
define transpose
 

259
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,110
define transpose
that looks like let's do it like a a is

260
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
that looks like let's do it like a a is
 

261
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,230
that looks like let's do it like a a is
the magic okay

262
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
the magic okay
 

263
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,430
the magic okay
and then we return b okay

264
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
and then we return b okay
 

265
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,309
and then we return b okay
okay let's call it r and c will be

266
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
okay let's call it r and c will be
 

267
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,029
okay let's call it r and c will be
original

268
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039

that's okay then a0 okay so that's the

274
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
that's okay then a0 okay so that's the
 

275
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,909
that's okay then a0 okay so that's the

i like we need to create a new metric

278
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
i like we need to create a new metric
 

279
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,189
i like we need to create a new metric
which let's call it b

280
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
which let's call it b
 

281
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,029

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,990
okay okay t
equals t yeah attack it or transfer so

284
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
equals t yeah attack it or transfer so
 

285
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,950
equals t yeah attack it or transfer so
let's do it

286
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
let's do it
 

287
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,189
let's do it

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
bc what's b next
 

339
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:31,270
bc what's b next
c r c rc so you see this is

340
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280

 

341
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,870

of course we are doing this you can

342
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
of course we are doing this you can
 

343
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,269
of course we are doing this you can
guess okay so look

344
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
guess okay so look
 

345
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,990
guess okay so look
this is a bit tricky this is to create

346
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
this is a bit tricky this is to create
 

347
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,310
this is a bit tricky this is to create
the original size is a

348
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
the original size is a
 

349
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,949
the original size is a
column and time thing now this could be

350
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
column and time thing now this could be
 

351
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,230
column and time thing now this could be
is create a

352
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
is create a
 

353
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,389
is create a
metric with c co c zeros and our columns

354
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
metric with c co c zeros and our columns
 

355
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,870
metric with c co c zeros and our columns
and then we go through each row each

356
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
and then we go through each row each
 

357
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,110
and then we go through each row each
each column in the original array

358
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
each column in the original array
 

359
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,990
each column in the original array
of magic which is rc but in the new

360
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
of magic which is rc but in the new
 

361
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,430
of magic which is rc but in the new
metric it should be cr what's the

362
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
metric it should be cr what's the
 

363
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:05,430
metric it should be cr what's the
time compensating

364
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:05,440

 

365
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,910

no you're just kissing

366
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920

 

367
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,829

using the r and c because when you say

368
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
using the r and c because when you say
 

369
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,190
using the r and c because when you say
log n when you say

370
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
log n when you say
 

371
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,230
log n when you say
n n means something i see

372
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
n n means something i see
 

373
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,470
n n means something i see
so what's c meaning here there's no c

374
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
so what's c meaning here there's no c
 

375
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,550
so what's c meaning here there's no c
minor here yeah

376
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
minor here yeah
 

377
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,310
minor here yeah
there is only r and c so what's the

378
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
there is only r and c so what's the
 

379
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,870
there is only r and c so what's the
complexity

380
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880

 

381
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,630

because we need to go through r times

382
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
because we need to go through r times
 

383
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,630
because we need to go through r times
rho and c times r do you get it

384
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
rho and c times r do you get it
 

385
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,630
rho and c times r do you get it
you're not guessing you're not saying n

386
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
you're not guessing you're not saying n
 

387
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,790
you're not guessing you're not saying n
and what what

388
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
and what what
 

389
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,150
and what what
you can say o o n

390
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
you can say o o n
 

391
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,470
you can say o o n
square right if n is a size of a square

392
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
square right if n is a size of a square
 

393
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,190
square right if n is a size of a square
metric if

394
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
metric if
 

395
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,590
metric if
this is n yes very much

396
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600

 

397
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,750

when you say oh something that's

398
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
when you say oh something that's
 

399
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,350
when you say oh something that's
something you need to mean it

400
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
something you need to mean it
 

401
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,350
something you need to mean it
you need to tell me what it is that i'm

402
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
you need to tell me what it is that i'm
 

403
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,030
you need to tell me what it is that i'm
right do i make that

404
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
right do i make that
 

405
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:09,910
right do i make that
okay so what's the space complexity

406
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920

 

407
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,470

because you need to allocate the new

408
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,480
because you need to allocate the new
 

409
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,710
because you need to allocate the new
basically you this is the metric you

410
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
basically you this is the metric you
 

411
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,430
basically you this is the metric you
you transpose it you rotate it you still

412
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
you transpose it you rotate it you still
 

413
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,590
you transpose it you rotate it you still
it still takes that much amount of space

414
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
it still takes that much amount of space
 

415
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,190
it still takes that much amount of space
am i right yeah we're done let's do the

416
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
am i right yeah we're done let's do the
 

417
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,750
am i right yeah we're done let's do the
coating

418
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760

 

419
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:45,190

can you turn on light please

420
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200

 

421
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,389

wait i need to take this off okay

422
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
wait i need to take this off okay
 

423
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:55,670
wait i need to take this off okay
and then i need a little bit blurry

424
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680

 

425
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,389

no now the picture's super blurry

426
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
no now the picture's super blurry
 

427
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,190
no now the picture's super blurry
well i forgot my password you can go

428
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
well i forgot my password you can go
 

429
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,150
well i forgot my password you can go
your father

430
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
your father
 

431
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,389
your father
oh yeah yeah it's one two five six eight

432
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
oh yeah yeah it's one two five six eight
 

433
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,350
oh yeah yeah it's one two five six eight
nine

434
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
nine
 

435
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,150
nine
you think one one three four zero three

436
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
you think one one three four zero three
 

437
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,710
you think one one three four zero three
right

438
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
right
 

439
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:19,670
right
is that all right is that alright

440
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680

 

441
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,910

oh my god i need to see i need to check

442
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920

 

443
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,509

okay that's it no don't don't touch it

444
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
okay that's it no don't don't touch it
 

445
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,910
okay that's it no don't don't touch it
i think this is all right very clear

446
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
i think this is all right very clear
 

447
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,350
i think this is all right very clear
yeah

448
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
yeah
 

449
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:53,350
yeah
i'm right myself

450
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360

 

451
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,070

that's okay

452
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,080

 

453
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:09,030

[Music]

454
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040

 

455
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,110

okay good so let's do the transpose okay

456
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
okay good so let's do the transpose okay
 

457
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,550
okay good so let's do the transpose okay
transpose ui

458
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
transpose ui
 

459
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,910
transpose ui
i wasn't here yesterday yeah that's okay

460
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920

 

461
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,190

i i i so let's do this original metric

462
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
i i i so let's do this original metric
 

463
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,910
i i i so let's do this original metric
okay

464
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
okay
 

465
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,030
okay
so we can do this so it equals

466
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
so we can do this so it equals
 

467
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,430
so we can do this so it equals
one two three okay and then

468
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
one two three okay and then
 

469
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,509
one two three okay and then
column four five six

470
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
column four five six
 

471
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,870
column four five six
let's do a square metric and not square

472
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
let's do a square metric and not square
 

473
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,310
let's do a square metric and not square
metric right

474
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320

 

475
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,230

and b equals

476
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
and b equals
 

477
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,269
and b equals
one two three

478
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
one two three
 

479
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,310
one two three
four five six okay and then that's it

480
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
four five six okay and then that's it
 

481
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,430
four five six okay and then that's it
one two three let's let's put in the uh

482
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
one two three let's let's put in the uh
 

483
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,389
one two three let's let's put in the uh
let's print this queen queen print the

484
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
let's print this queen queen print the
 

485
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,190
let's print this queen queen print the
magic okay

486
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
magic okay
 

487
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,550
magic okay
print the battery a so we just do this

488
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
print the battery a so we just do this
 

489
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,190
print the battery a so we just do this
for

490
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
for
 

491
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,389
for
r in

492
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399

 

493
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,629

but we can just do this a and then print

494
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
but we can just do this a and then print
 

495
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,310
but we can just do this a and then print
up okay print the r

496
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
up okay print the r
 

497
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,750
up okay print the r
so if i think yeah yeah let's do this

498
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
so if i think yeah yeah let's do this
 

499
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,350
so if i think yeah yeah let's do this
let's try metric a and put printer

500
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
let's try metric a and put printer
 

501
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,230
let's try metric a and put printer
matrix

502
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
matrix
 

503
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,470
matrix
b let's see if it works okay

504
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,480

 

505
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,670

one two three four five six yeah it
becomes three rows and two columns

676
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,640
becomes three rows and two columns
 

677
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,990
becomes three rows and two columns
yeah yeah okay

678
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
yeah yeah okay
 

679
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,150
yeah yeah okay
this is the python because we already

680
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
this is the python because we already
 

681
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,110
this is the python because we already
know how to

682
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
know how to
 

683
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,029
know how to
how to do it in python and it's quite

684
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:03,039
how to do it in python and it's quite
 

685
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,029
how to do it in python and it's quite
useful so that's why computer already

686
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
useful so that's why computer already
 

687
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,070
useful so that's why computer already
provides this

688
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
provides this
 

689
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,870
provides this
so we don't have to reinvent the wheel

690
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
so we don't have to reinvent the wheel
 

691
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,029
so we don't have to reinvent the wheel
you know we invent the wheel

692
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
you know we invent the wheel
 

693
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,230
you know we invent the wheel
you know the phase we invented we are if

694
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
you know the phase we invented we are if
 

695
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,909
you know the phase we invented we are if
it means something that has been

696
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
it means something that has been
 

697
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,230
it means something that has been
invented we don't need to

698
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
invented we don't need to
 

699
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,510
invented we don't need to
invent it again i'm right yeah

700
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
invent it again i'm right yeah
 

701
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,510
invent it again i'm right yeah
i'm right hello
