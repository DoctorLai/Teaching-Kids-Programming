1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,100
right

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,240
so guess what

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:12,320
well irregular circles something eggs

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,780
eggs okay eggs

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,300
okay so okay these are actually balloons

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,400
okay they don't look anything like

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,400
balloons okay I'll get eggs okay eggs

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,720
so we are giving this eggs on the wall

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,539
suppose that you just put the eggs

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,539
attach the eggs

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,539
Friday

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,100
Okay okay something like that yes let's

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,500
say how about the balloons you know

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,540
balloons are simple yeah but they don't

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,780
like anything like balloons they look

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,539
like so you only know the extraordinate

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,879
left and right right you only know but

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,120
you don't know the Y coordinates okay so

19
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,860
that doesn't matter so yeah accordingly

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,820
so

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,780
coordinate okay look at these

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,780
coordinates

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,479
so if we should

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,420
if we have this error right

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,400
okay if we have this error

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,439
you know vertical errors

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,299
so last time we have a vertical Arrow

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:27,180
here then if this error goes forever

29
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,880
right from bottom to the top and then

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,460
you will burst the balloons right so

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,439
look first up again but if I have

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,560
another arrow here you'll pass this

33
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,540
balloon so the question is

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,579
it that's good yeah that's good

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,439
observation yeah so the question is how

36
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,659
many we want to find out the minimum

37
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,340
number of errors that can burst all the

38
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,340
balloons one two three

39
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:59,399
one two three yes okay got it yeah so

40
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:02,759
let's say we have a unlimited number of

41
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,219
uh errors and then we are given a list

42
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,899
of balloons right but we don't know why

43
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,880
coordinates actually we don't need to

44
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,520
know the wild thing is we just need to

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,340
know the X boundary of the balloon and

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,140
they are regular Circle okay they are

47
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,140
regular Circle like this

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,180
that one doesn't look nice

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,120
that's okay but all we need to know is

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,760
that the balloon of our place yeah a

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,920
place on the wall right

52
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,739
and then we want to find out the minimum

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,220
number of the arrows that could burst

54
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,560
all the balloons right and

55
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,260
and you're saying that three how do you

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,260
know history because like it's my plane

57
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,140
I checked the ones above it

58
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,760
yeah so what's your strategy here so you

59
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,980
know I'm just giving you so what's your

60
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:58,260
strategy how do we know it's uh you know

61
00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:02,220
one two three I I just eat my big smart

62
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,260
the balloon will be bursted if look if

63
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,800
this x i x

64
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:11,220
smaller than equal than this uh right

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:14,300
okay right and bigger than equal is left

66
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:18,360
okay if it is the balloon X

67
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:21,239
catching the left boundary or right

68
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,480
boundary you count it as a bursting okay

69
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:28,200
and it could fall into any values

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,000
between this range okay so yeah we've

71
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,459
given that this stuff to be like zero

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,200
and one can be like 0.5 it doesn't

73
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,480
matter because we are not we are not

74
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,239
finding when we should put the error

75
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,239
right we just want to know how many

76
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,640
right so but that's a good question like

77
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,959
we can just put it any one but only one

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,959
is enough right

79
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:53,599
yeah so we don't care which one where

80
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:57,239
exactly you just need one Arrow why

81
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:01,319
no just place this the error Circle uh

82
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,840
look Arrow now if Queen no it doesn't

83
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,159
redirect okay okay that's okay it

84
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,640
doesn't look that right okay it doesn't

85
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:11,280
change the directions it's just uh going

86
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,280
straight up forever forever it could

87
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,880
burst as many balloons

88
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,079
as they can along the direction vertical

89
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,979
up

90
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,020
okay so what's your strategy here

91
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,100
any idea any idea well if they're no

92
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,900
balloons

93
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,460
no balloon just returns yellow good

94
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,520
question that's a common case yeah no

95
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,479
balloons given nothing can you get

96
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,580
deceiving fault do you get this

97
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,320
no we just want to find out the minimum

98
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,900
number so minimum

99
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,660
number

100
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:50,759
of Errors to First

101
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:53,460
oh balloon

102
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,440
okay this is the question why I'll lose

103
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,440
you you are very clear right so we just

104
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,759
launched a vertical errors and balloons

105
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:06,240
so when it touches like the side of the

106
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,340
blue new bus let's try yes yeah

107
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,560
so

108
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,900
this is the kind of question remember we

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,820
talk about the interval thing right is

110
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,800
this kind of similar question in the

111
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,020
verse finding the intersection of

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,720
intervals right so we can visualize this

113
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,120
right this is one interval this is

114
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,620
another interval this is another

115
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,100
interval right

116
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,860
and then another interval

117
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,100
another interview right so we visualized

118
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,039
as these there are five intervals look

119
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,419
one two three four five so we want to

120
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,539
find out

121
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:44,699
how many right connected how many

122
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,560
components how many groups so obviously

123
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,780
by looking at it we know that one two

124
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,199
three right so three arrowser all right

125
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:56,759
yeah okay to solve interval questions

126
00:05:52,199 --> 00:06:01,080
one usual way is to solve them to solve

127
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:04,020
all the coordinates solar intervals okay

128
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,440
so once we started we can go through

129
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,120
this right so we can sort the intervals

130
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,580
by the end point

131
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,199
okay so why do we need to solve the

132
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,539
intervals by the endpoint not the

133
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,000
starting point this is the question you

134
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,699
need to think about okay so look yeah

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,620
zero one right here

136
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,060
two three

137
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,180
and then

138
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,280
three four this is five seven and five

139
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,479
six right so we put the

140
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:38,460
five six here and then five seven okay

141
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:40,919
okay zero one two three four five this

142
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,139
is six this is seven okay

143
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,479
so now let's just take the first

144
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,319
interval this is current n which is

145
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:52,620
equal one right and obviously we need at

146
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,440
least one error to first the first

147
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,360
balloon right so answer equals one right

148
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,639
we check this one

149
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,000
we check if the

150
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,280
but if this is smaller than that if the

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,500
N is smaller than the beginning of the

152
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,600
next experiment right so we need one

153
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,080
more error right all right yeah because

154
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,080
it is

155
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,740
okay forget about

156
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,539
[Music]

157
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:30,780
it okay but and anyway just imagine this

158
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:33,840
is a different example okay so look

159
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,660
and it's smaller than the at least the

160
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,120
start of this panel so look visually

161
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,440
they are separated so we need to plus

162
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,940
one

163
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,039
all right

164
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,039
and as long as we press one we need to

165
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,860
change this end to here because this

166
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,060
covers up to this point so the end of

167
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,680
these three

168
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,539
if 3 is smaller than 3. no right if it's

169
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,039
not smaller than three if it's smaller

170
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,259
than three we need one more error to

171
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,759
burst this one but it's not smaller than

172
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,280
three it means the current error

173
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,620
converts this one okay

174
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,860
next okay so what's left

175
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,620
this balloon five and six is three less

176
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,900
than five yes this Arrow cannot pass

177
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,539
this column so we need to plus one and

178
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,220
then we change this end to counter n

179
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,740
which is six

180
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,680
okay so now we change the six now we

181
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,039
check this one it's six

182
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,399
smaller than five no no so it means that

183
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,020
the last error first this person

184
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,200
makes sense

185
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:41,219
yeah if it's smaller look if this this

186
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,399
is n right and this is the next one a

187
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:47,580
this is one situation if n is smaller

188
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:51,060
than a we need one more error to pass

189
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,339
this balloon and then once we turn left

190
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:57,060
we need to move this end

191
00:08:53,339 --> 00:09:00,959
to here because that indicates the next

192
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:04,140
error can cover up to this point and

193
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,140
then we just iterated to the check if

194
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,459
and is not smaller than a so look this

195
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,320
is n

196
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:13,140
is not smaller than

197
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,480
you hit this way right look this is n is

198
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,279
a and it's not smaller than a

199
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,740
so what does it mean let's have an error

200
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,260
can pass this balloon

201
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,820
so we don't need one more error right we

202
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,000
can just jump to next one make sense

203
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,339
this is kind of usual way we solve the

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,080
interval pressure solar intervals and

205
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,300
then going from the left to the right we

206
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,880
need to sort by the end point so look

207
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,260
the input means this one

208
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,660
these

209
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,540
comes before life right another example

210
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,700
is yeah okay so which comes first which

211
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,860
comes first look this is the one

212
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,980
interval this is another interval we

213
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,620
need to compare we need to put the

214
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,860
interval the endpoint right the end

215
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,860
point smaller that's the coordinate the

216
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,720
balloon with the smaller right

217
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,519
before so right

218
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,260
okay

219
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:09,360
because we are checking we are checking

220
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:11,940
we need to move to a smaller right

221
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,160
and instead of the Pickled right and

222
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,800
balloon

223
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,019
dot salt what's the time complexity for

224
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,860
this one if they are endurance oh and

225
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,600
again okay all right okay the space

226
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,920
complexity usually oh and again as well

227
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,339
okay so now

228
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,459
the N equals the first balloon

229
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,920
the first one zero the end point right

230
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:37,380
zero one zero means the first one the

231
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,200
index the one means the end point the

232
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,720
the right boundary okay so we have to

233
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,440
also check if not balloon then we return

234
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,959
zero right if we are given zero values

235
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,959
then we just return

236
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,360
look the answer

237
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,839
at least we need one error right for a b

238
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,720
in burnt we start from the second

239
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:07,380
problem to the end right

240
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:10,500
e n is smaller than a

241
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:13,040
if we need one more error if the current

242
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,800
error does not burst the next balloon

243
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,339
then answer plus equal one

244
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,980
okay and then what's next if left n is

245
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,079
smaller than a the current error does

246
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,839
not pass the next balloon we plus the

247
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,480
answer we need one more errors and and

248
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,940
equals B right we jump to the right

249
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,040
boundary of the next element right and

250
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,339
then that's it right hand

251
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,839
answer this is the angular simple the

252
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:43,380
key thing here is

253
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,600
balloons dot sword is to sort it using a

254
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,540
quick salt right usually clicks off and

255
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,940
then this is the right battery of the

256
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,700
first person and then answer equals one

257
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,440
and then we go through the tolerance for

258
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,940
the second one to the end we can just go

259
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,500
through from a star we don't need this

260
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,920
and it still works why why is that

261
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,779
because the end is the n right boundary

262
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,720
of first room on the first iteration

263
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:09,660
this never gets executed it just weighs

264
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,720
one cycle because n equals a and the

265
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,540
next one so the key idea is that we saw

266
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,519
the balloons we saw the balloons by the

267
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,680
right boundary okay by the right

268
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,339
boundary thought here we need to sort by

269
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,820
the right boundary look by a b sort by

270
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,920
this one so k equals Lambda x x one okay

271
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,160
this is very important okay we sorting

272
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,500
let alone by the right boundary not the

273
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,380
left boundary and then we just have to

274
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,440
check what's the first distance

275
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:44,339
let the current error come first

276
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,980
the end which is indicated by n if n is

277
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,320
smaller than a right it means the

278
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,560
current error cannot reach the next

279
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,139
balloon we need one more barrel and then

280
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,839
we move that current

281
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,880
error to the right of the

282
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,360
next person so the terms of let's say

283
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:08,700
dominating and login and this is just o

284
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:11,160
n so it's o n log n plus n but it's

285
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,740
dominating by this one so we drop the

286
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,100
trivial part okay okay so what have you

287
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,669
learned today

288
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,669
[Music]

289
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:30,360
so if it is kind of like you you have

290
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,399
balloons and you have an arrow

291
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,100
is that you have balloons and you have

292
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,339
like a banana

293
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,940
and you gotta travel

294
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:41,459
balloons

295
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,579
so if it's kind of like if a balloon is

296
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:48,360
behind it another balloon you can burst

297
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:51,060
more than one and so and so for this we

298
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,860
use kind of like an intervals so so it

299
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,399
kind of looks like there's

300
00:13:52,860 --> 00:14:00,300
um the kind of bubbles kind of thing and

301
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:04,260
then for the more previous one like that

302
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:07,380
one so you get this end and this

303
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,260
beginning if the end is smaller than a

304
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:14,100
we need two

305
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:16,440
if but if it ended bigger or or equal we

306
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,899
can bust two balloons at once that's

307
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,820
right yes yes exactly okay okay that's

308
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,880
it for the day bye

309
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,880
bye
