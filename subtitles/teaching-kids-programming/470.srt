1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
yo

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,279
hello me tell me mr runner all right

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,120
okay now let's look at this final tree

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,160
okay okay one

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,639
two what's finally trees a binary tree

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,040
is a tree with numbers

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,440
okay so upside down tree

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,359
the uptight the trunk

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,119
the leaves and the leaves don't have any

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,960
children the loot does not have any

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,920
pearls if you look outside now this is

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,359
the root here this is the root

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,800
okay upside down this is the leaves

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,680
okay

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,559
so the binary tree is is a graph

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,360
um

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,480
that does not have any cycles yeah

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,200
directly acyclic png

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,680
yeah

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,160
does that not have any cycles and

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,120
it's connected one in one piece okay if

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,280
we have a small tree what do we call it

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,199
you know if it is this is not connected

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,079
what do we call it

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,800
forest yeah exactly first

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,960
yeah so we only have one root right we

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,760
only have one root so for this one you

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,640
know multiple roots so multiple trees

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,520
and forests okay so today questions very

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,200
simple so we want to find out the sum

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,759
of the deepest leaves okay

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,400
some of these

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,920
leaves so what what how can we do this

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,560
what's the what's the sum of the

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
difference this thing is in this tree

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,920
come on six easy exactly okay how about

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,960
i add another one

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,040
okay what's the sum of 16 16 exactly

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,880
okay that's it the question is very

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
similar how can we do it

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,799
i'm going to do it easier it's easy so

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,040
how can we do it

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,079
how many ways we can traverse the binary

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,320
tree and how do we do it i mean

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,280
breakfast

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,040
which one you think is easier

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,880
in this case

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,880
better search and how about you which

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,079
one you think is easier both are okay so

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,079
which one you think is easier

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,600
to guess

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,479
why okay

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,640
yes

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,799
you're right

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,879
because

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,720
it's a wild guess well i guess okay so

57
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,120
buffer search you know professors will

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,360
travel a tree by a level by level and

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,520
then we updated the sun

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,879
to to do this in pepper search we have

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,920
the dictionary dictionary dictionary and

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,920
the keys will be the levels

63
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,080
and the value will be the sum so we

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,120
traverse the uh different search right

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,360
whichever

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,280
search and then we accumulate the sum

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,080
for each level right and once we have

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
this dictionary so for example

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
uh the sum

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,239
sub dictionary yeah some is dictionary

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
we go through we traverse the

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,200
binary tree and then we pass down the

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,800
levels and we accumulate the sum of for

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,680
each level and then we what we need to

75
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,160
do

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,160
so we just need to return the maximum

77
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,400
level right because it says the

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
difference yeah so you'll be max

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,920
s dot keys and that will be the sum okay

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,760
easy so i think i think definition is

81
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,959
easier to implement for the perfect

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,120
search

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,040
level by level yeah every time we take

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,280
the notes because we know all the notes

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,080
in the sentence in a queue remember we

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,560
talked about this a few days ago yeah

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,040
look if we every time we put uh the

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,480
first one we put the dude in we take it

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
out we put the kids

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,280
in

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,879
yeah we take it off

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,640
we put the kids four five zero we take

93
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,920
take all the notes i'll push their kids

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,640
six 10 so the la we always uh updated

95
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,599
the sum we keep a value of the sum for

96
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
the

97
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,280
for the current level

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,760
yeah when the weather search terminates

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,760
then the sum would be the

100
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,480
will be the level of the deepest leaves

101
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,519
okay

102
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,239
so let's go for the definition okay so

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,239
we can traverse the different search in

104
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,480
the tree in how many orders i'll give

105
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,680
you another example

106
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,680
pre-order

107
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,680
pre-order

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,560
what do we have pre-order in order and

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,439
what poisson yeah

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,080
these are typically three orders

111
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,519
yeah but maybe we can have this reverse

112
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,639
you know yeah

113
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,720
uh a binary search tree if we perform an

114
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,799
inorder on a banister stream we get this

115
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,600
in order right we get a list in order

116
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,720
okay

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,720
and let's say d equals the dictionary uh

118
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,120
before dictionary okay

119
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,639
because and then we want to

120
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,880
be able to use this before key which is

121
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,280
initialized to zero if we given the type

122
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,840
value type is in okay

123
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,440
define definite search and then we have

124
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,240
this first parameter as the rule the

125
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,680
second parameter is the level

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,600
level okay

127
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,400
if not root

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,720
if non-load will just return

129
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,160
otherwise what look d

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,759
level

131
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,919
plus equal blue dot value okay

132
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:05,919
and we just traverse the left tree

133
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,919
and then we traverse the right tree

134
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,639
and

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,240
and what do we do we can

136
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,360
d

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,160
max

138
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,120
the

139
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,120
keys okay

140
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,120
okay that's it look i'm going to

141
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,039
explain this and then you need to tell

142
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,840
me later back up

143
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,039
dictionary default dictionary

144
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,840
dictionary.com the keys would be the

145
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,800
number the value would be the sum i know

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,960
it just travels uh traversal uh okay so

147
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
we have to call this definite root and

148
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,039
then let's pass the parameter the first

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,199
one is never zero so we traverse a

150
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,080
recursively and then when we visit this

151
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,960
node look we accumulate

152
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,120
the sum the level with this blue dot

153
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,600
value and then we travel the left tree

154
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,080
will write really closely and then some

155
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
of the deepest leaves deepest which is

156
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,560
the max

157
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,960
level right the next level max

158
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,080
level d dot keys is the level max dot

159
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
levels

160
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,919
right and we want to get the values

161
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,240
so the the time conducting oh and yes we

162
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,880
have to traverse the order nodes each

163
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,120
node is visited exactly once the

164
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,919
space complexity is o

165
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,240
o n or o h h is the height of the tree

166
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,520
right in the worst case h will be the n

167
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
right

168
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,479
okay in what cases in the worst cases o

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,800
h equals o n why is that can you tell me

170
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,960
why the in the worst cases

171
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,720
why the height is the number of nodes

172
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,800
can you give me an example like in worst

173
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,080
cases what does the binary tree look

174
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,759
like

175
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,000
that's the highest line

176
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,440
where that is looks like line yeah

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,800
like that yeah

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,280
okay

179
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,120
not exactly not necessarily to produce a

180
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,720
straight line it could be

181
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,000
like that yeah

182
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,080
let's still o h equals one all right

183
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,880
yeah make sense

184
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,199
can you explain to me what's this

185
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,199
that's

186
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,319
so um

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,800
are adding we are we are accumulating

188
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,840
the sum for this level here okay

189
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,759
okay so there's another problem level

190
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,680
needs to pass one okay i forgot this

191
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,199
most important thing

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,800
okay yeah

193
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,120
because we're going

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,440
down we need to

195
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,919
we need to implement that am right

196
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,800
yeah okay what have you learned today so

197
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,880
far

198
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,800
about

199
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,720
whatever

200
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,039
what are we trying to do today and what

201
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,160
are we what kind of equipment should we

202
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,720
use today

203
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,880
we're using different assets

204
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,199
okay and then what kind of how do we

205
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,880
implement this staff research

206
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,880
how do we implement this definition

207
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,599
and what kind of data structure we need

208
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,360
to use to store the

209
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,360
sum for each level stack

210
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,599
what data structure you were using we're

211
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,479
not using any

212
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,560
stationery they stole the

213
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,960
keys

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,960
okay that's it for today bye bye bye
