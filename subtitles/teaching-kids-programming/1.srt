1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,480
okay

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,519
yep so today

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,160
come on eric uh i'm going to talk about

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,160
recursion

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,160
so tell me what's the question

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,760
i-c-u-r-s-i-o-n

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,080
recursion tell me what does it mean

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,800
i don't know you don't know what's what

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,400
does that mean

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,480
what does this word mean in english

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,680
i don't know okay that's right

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,719
simplicity properly please

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,840
recursion so

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,160
it's like something that calls itself

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,399
repeatedly

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,399
so

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,440
so for example if i define the function

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,199
yeah if i define the function

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:01,120
like let's say factorial yeah

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:04,960
you know factorial yeah like n factorial

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:10,840
equals n times n minus 1

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:14,080
times n minus 2 times until 1 right

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,439
yeah three factorial equals three times

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,439
two times one all right

25
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,520
so do you see this what's this what's

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,040
this bit

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,520
that's two factorial yeah and what's

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
this

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,360
that's one factorial i hope about four

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,360
factorial

31
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,320
equals four times three times two times

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,360
one right

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,479
yeah what's this

34
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,000
three factors yeah

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,640
do you understand so this problem can be

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,439
solved by solving a smaller problem

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
right

38
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,960
yeah okay so we call it

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
we can call this like let's call it f

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,040
function okay f

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,560
n okay so it's the

42
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,000
base case if it's one if

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,640
n is one

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,160
return one one factorial is what

45
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,080
one one then as we don't need to

46
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
write the errors but it's good to write

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,120
the errors

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,599
because you can say okay return if n is

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,640
one return one a has to return

50
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,040
and right this is n yeah

51
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
times

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,840
what's this f and -1

53
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,519
yeah look this is minus one we're

54
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,720
calling excel so this is called

55
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,120
recursion

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,000
look at it because now we are solving

57
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,760
this problem

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,519
by solving a smaller problem yeah

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,319
okay and now it comes itself okay

60
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,840
so so let's let's do this example f3

61
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,200
okay

62
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
so what do we have f3

63
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,040
f3 okay we come here n

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,480
is three it's not equals one so as yeah

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,800
what does it return so f3 it will return

66
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,640
three times f3 minus one f2 right

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,680
all right yes okay f2

68
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,879
calling itself if n is one no

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,560
right your f2 will become two

70
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,519
times f1 right yes

71
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,959
f1 if only was one then what we return

72
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,000
one

73
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,319
okay so we can going backwards two times

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
one

75
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:47,360
two two times three six so s3 equals six

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,280
yes any questions so far

77
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,000
no yeah no no it's easier is it

78
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
is it easy

79
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:04,239
okay so look what this recursion

80
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,070
look recursion anyway where is the

81
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,300
location happen can you tell me

82
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,300
[Music]

83
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,959
that yeah look this is the function we

84
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,759
defined here

85
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,840
yeah look it's calling itself with

86
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,680
another parameter which is a smaller

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,960
one right because we are solving the

88
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,040
problem with n

89
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,400
and now we're calling excel because the

90
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,240
recording is with n

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,520
minus one yeah so n n minus 1

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,000
and minus 2 until we reach n n equals 1

93
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,280
which we know how to solve it

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
yeah because when n is 1 we return 1

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,040
and when n is 2 it will return 2 times

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,080
f1

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,360
yeah which is 1. so we're calling itself

98
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,080
okay

99
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,000
yes okay do you want to input this in

100
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,880
the computer okay i'm going to turn this

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,880
off for a while
