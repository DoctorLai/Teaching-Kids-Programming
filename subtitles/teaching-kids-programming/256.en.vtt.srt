00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,990

doubling that means that it could be

doubling that means that it could be
 

33
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,590
doubling that means that it could be
pointing to next and pointing to

you'll be something like that but we are

38
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
you'll be something like that but we are
 

39
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,270
you'll be something like that but we are
talking about let's think

40
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
talking about let's think
 

41
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,990
talking about let's think
it's only point okay so each no three no

42
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
it's only point okay so each no three no
 

43
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,430
it's only point okay so each no three no
no not just two

44
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
no not just two
 

45
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,709
no not just two
so only the synthesis would be a node

46
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:46,719
so only the synthesis would be a node
 

47
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,470
so only the synthesis would be a node
contains a value and then point a link

48
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
contains a value and then point a link
 

49
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,350
contains a value and then point a link
points to another node yeah so it knows

50
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
points to another node yeah so it knows
 

51
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,029
points to another node yeah so it knows
means to another node

52
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
means to another node
 

53
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,310
means to another node
so here this is okay so this is a single

54
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
so here this is okay so this is a single
 

55
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,510
so here this is okay so this is a single
node and i want you to change it to so

56
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
node and i want you to change it to so
 

57
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,709
node and i want you to change it to so
let each node

58
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
let each node
 

59
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,910
let each node
points to points to

60
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
points to points to
 

61
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,870
points to points to
the value number of nodes ahead so for

62
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
the value number of nodes ahead so for
 

63
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,149
the value number of nodes ahead so for
number two

64
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
number two
 

65
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,750
number two
so meaning jumps to two jumps two

66
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
so meaning jumps to two jumps two
 

67
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,350
so meaning jumps to two jumps two
one two yeah so the two should be points

68
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
one two yeah so the two should be points
 

69
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,149
one two yeah so the two should be points
to

70
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
to
 

71
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,310
to
four here now and i don't care about the

72
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,320
four here now and i don't care about the
 

73
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,390
four here now and i don't care about the
one and then four

74
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400
one and then four
 

75
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,910
one and then four
through four jump but it doesn't have

76
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
through four jump but it doesn't have
 

77
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,710
through four jump but it doesn't have
enough force knows then

78
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
enough force knows then
 

79
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,469
enough force knows then
because they're only one node left so

80
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
because they're only one node left so
 

81
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,830
because they're only one node left so
you you you

82
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
you you you
 

83
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,350
you you you
just needs to needs to jump points to

84
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
just needs to needs to jump points to
 

85
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,069
just needs to needs to jump points to
noon

86
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
noon
 

87
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,590
noon
to none okay another example like

88
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
to none okay another example like
 

89
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,750
to none okay another example like
one two

90
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:43,760

93
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,109

so what was one one jumps to the here so

94
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:55,119
so what was one one jumps to the here so
 

95
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,469
so what was one one jumps to the here so
let's hear two

96
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
let's hear two
 

97
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,749
let's hear two
two jumps one two right so this these

98
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
two jumps one two right so this these
 

99
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,550
two jumps one two right so this these
will be

100
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
will be
 

101
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,789
will be
you have to start from the beginning one

102
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
you have to start from the beginning one
 

103
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,550
you have to start from the beginning one
one one yeah okay

104
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
one one yeah okay
 

105
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,910
one one yeah okay
yes start from the beginning so the

106
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
yes start from the beginning so the
 

107
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,590
yes start from the beginning so the
first note is always the no we don't

108
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
first note is always the no we don't
 

109
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,229
first note is always the no we don't
want to keep

110
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
want to keep
 

111
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,309
want to keep
then you can go one direction yeah one

112
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
then you can go one direction yeah one
 

113
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:21,270
then you can go one direction yeah one
direction

define let's say jump
 

135
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,509
define let's say jump
and then note okay first of all if

136
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
and then note okay first of all if
 

137
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,509
and then note okay first of all if
there's the only one now what happened

baby pretend no
 

147
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,670
baby pretend no
no no no right because it's empty then

148
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
no no no right because it's empty then
 

149
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,670
no no no right because it's empty then
there's no need to continue right

150
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
there's no need to continue right
 

151
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,309
there's no need to continue right
and then now look head equals no i

152
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
and then now look head equals no i
 

153
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,710
and then now look head equals no i
so here this is the note right i don't

154
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
so here this is the note right i don't
 

155
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,670
so here this is the note right i don't
care how many

156
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
care how many
 

157
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,830
care how many
i want to jump this is head here i

158
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
i want to jump this is head here i

00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
the head very well because this is the
 

171
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,110
the head very well because this is the
value we want to jump right up like two

172
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
value we want to jump right up like two
 

173
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,229
value we want to jump right up like two
to head of value

all right yes and
 

177
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,390
all right yes and
how can we jump how can we jump head how

178
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
how can we jump how can we jump head how
 

179
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,830
how can we jump how can we jump head how
can we jump to the next half equal as

180
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
can we jump to the next half equal as
 

181
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,770
can we jump to the next half equal as
well

182

already reached the end
 

189
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,670

no it's not head what happened if here

190
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
no it's not head what happened if here
 

191
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,670
no it's not head what happened if here
not head or weapon

192

not head or weapon
 

193
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,869
not head or weapon
and pointing the nail thingy no okay i

194
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
and pointing the nail thingy no okay i
 

195
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,229
and pointing the nail thingy no okay i
can just break yeah

196
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
can just break yeah
 

197
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,190
can just break yeah
break right because look because you

198
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
break right because look because you
 

199
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,589
break right because look because you
just

200
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
just
 

201
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,270
just
break because if you don't break it what

202
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
break because if you don't break it what
 

203
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,830
break because if you don't break it what
happened the next iteration happens and

204
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
happened the next iteration happens and
 

205
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,349
happened the next iteration happens and
you return something

206
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
you return something
 

207
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,350
you return something
okay so what why what are we doing here

208
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
okay so what why what are we doing here
 

209
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,710
okay so what why what are we doing here
we are finding the head

210
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
we are finding the head
 

211
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,310
we are finding the head
the points to the next one so no right

212
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
the points to the next one so no right
 

213
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,629
the points to the next one so no right
now next equals

214
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
now next equals
 

215
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,430
now next equals
what jump

216
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440

 

217
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,469

jump jump what can you feel the blank

218
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
jump jump what can you feel the blank
 

219
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:51,270
jump jump what can you feel the blank
and return

220
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280

 

221
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,430

jump here i divide it jump i want to

222
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
jump here i divide it jump i want to
 

223
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,270
jump here i divide it jump i want to
because it will jump away

224
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
because it will jump away
 

225
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,189
because it will jump away
why got it

226
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
why got it
 

227
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,189
why got it
come on so what does this mean here

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,150
come on so what does this mean here
after this point this head will be the

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
after this point this head will be the
 

231
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:17,189
after this point this head will be the
head
