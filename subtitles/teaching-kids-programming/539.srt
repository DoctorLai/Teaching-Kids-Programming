1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:06,000
hello Miss Mary Mr Rhino right

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,420
Okay so we've given this uh four digit

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,940
number and our test is to split the

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,219
number into two we can use the digit

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,640
this is these four digit so we want to

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,500
split the digit into two and now we want

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,019
to minimize the sum for example like

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,359
this one if we split these into one two

9
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:29,699
and three four and by the way you can

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,880
rearrange these numbers right you can be

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,059
2 1 or 43 and we want to minimize some

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,020
so the sum is 46 can you find the

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:45,140
smaller one yes what is this 13 and 24

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:48,960
13 plus 24 Max

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,940
37 that's smaller and anymore

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,039
14 and 23

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:01:00,559
14 and 23 that's it's 47. is it the same

18
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,559
answer this one yeah okay anymore

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,740
okay so basically we can prove off right

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:12,380
do we have to try splitting the number

21
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,380
into three digits and one digit no

22
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,780
yes because of no matter which three

23
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,580
digit is at least three digits right

24
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,759
there will be a hundreds right maybe

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,560
hundreds

26
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,200
good question one zero zero one okay two

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,360
two yeah we can have bleeding yellows

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,100
bleeding zeros so like obviously this is

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,340
four units you know one plus zero one

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,220
right it's two okay how about this one

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,799
do one plus zero zero thirty four one

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,159
two five four and two sorry what did you

33
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,560
say one two three four one two five four

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,560
one two three four and two one plus zero

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,640
zero one okay okay yes yes we'll add two

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,640
very special case

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,780
this is 27

38
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,680
. okay so how do you know this is the

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,780
smallest

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,580
yeah we can try I mean obviously this is

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,920
just four digits we can prove us right

42
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,480
four digit we can prove ourselves as we

43
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,739
said that we don't want to try the three

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,520
teachers thing right so how many

45
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:21,180
possibilities so four digit we just pick

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,879
two as the first number right and this

47
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,120
is the normal way of picking the

48
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:31,560
two-digit and now we need to times two

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,319
right this is the overall proof of if we

50
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,480
don't try three digit thing right so

51
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,520
what's this number four Apple speaking

52
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,500
to Apples right there for that five plus

53
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,019
we just have to pick two apples as the

54
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,060
first number and then how many ways so

55
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,680
this is basically

56
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,019
p

57
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,660
four apples picking two apples but with

58
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:56,040
sequence right so it's four times

59
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:58,620
3 12 waves right this is just 12 12

60
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,500
different ways we have to prove us three

61
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,760
different ways right okay

62
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,700
so this one if I saw this number

63
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,680
okay if I saw this number this is the

64
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,680
small list this is the biggest

65
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,959
so obviously this this big is number

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,240
where do we want to keep this biggest

67
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,599
number

68
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,840
[Music]

69
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:23,700
the biggest digit we want it to be hands

70
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,099
or we only repeat it once

71
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,019
we only be once obviously right so we

72
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,420
want to be two ones here

73
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,060
okay so here there are two numbers put

74
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,840
us together this is the ones how about

75
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,780
this number this is the smallest put it

76
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,640
before before yeah so this is I wanted

77
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,060
to obviously I want to put it here right

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,360
so yeah and then these two which one is

79
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,420
bigger so it's bigger so the bigger one

80
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,480
we want to put it in right in the ones

81
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,720
right yeah in a while

82
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,080
so this is the smallest 27 one two three

83
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,920
four so four I want to put it you know

84
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,040
once

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,159
one and put it in a tens and then two

86
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,860
three seven okay this is just common

87
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,879
sense right the big digit I want it to

88
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:17,880
be in uh once that's not the digit we

89
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,199
can put it in the tens okay if we're

90
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,239
given these four digits how do we

91
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,940
extract each digit well we can convert

92
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,880
it to a string right one way or because

93
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,160
this is four digits if this is n all

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,080
right how do we convert it to each

95
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,960
Studio first of all we convert it to a

96
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,240
string all right convert to a string and

97
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,880
then we

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,419
split we convert it to an array of

99
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,139
digits and then we have to map it as

100
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:49,620
method as integer right

101
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:53,639
okay I know we need to sort it

102
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:56,040
salt it right so look this is two three

103
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,580
four one if this is two three four one

104
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,900
Str will put a cloth that's the string

105
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,639
least if we do this list you'll become

106
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,960
two three

107
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,720
four

108
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,320
one right this is the list we map it to

109
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,199
integer so that will become two three

110
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,560
four one all right I know we sort it now

111
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,720
become one two three four okay that's

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,400
basically what it is right and then we

113
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,380
just have to return

114
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,560
this number

115
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,419
this number times 10 plus

116
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,440
this number

117
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:37,440
and then plus this number times 10

118
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,720
right because it's in the tens Plus

119
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,600
this number okay and now okay okay

120
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,180
another way I'll do three four one if we

121
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,139
want to get it into each number so this

122
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,180
if this is n and modulus 10 that will

123
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,460
give us one right and then we need to

124
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,100
divide this number into ten now become

125
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,919
two three four and then

126
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,039
we keep doing this right we remove the

127
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,320
last digit that the ones a number like

128
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:08,000
one two three four how do we get this

129
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,000
how to get the digit only once

130
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,580
yeah modular scent right

131
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,919
yeah and then how do we remove that last

132
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,020
digit we just divided by 10 right

133
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,639
divided by 10 it will be one two three

134
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,680
point four but we converted to the

135
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,780
integer so one one two three okay one

136
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,419
two three

137
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:31,460
123 models ten divided by 10 remaining

138
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,460
three okay yeah make sense

139
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,100
yeah one two three six is the same yeah

140
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,819
so one two three six six six equals one

141
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,940
two three six modulus ten and then

142
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:48,720
one two three equals one two three six

143
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:52,440
divided by divided ten right in Python

144
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,440
okay in Python right modulus divided

145
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,960
yeah you see six I want to get this last

146
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,600
the lowermost digit I'm not understand I

147
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,400
want to remove the rightmost digit I

148
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:07,919
divided by 10. double divide means to

149
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,979
divide by 10 and only keep the integer

150
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,300
part forget about the fraction okay okay

151
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,639
so what have you learned today and

152
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,180
that's it I learned about numbers

153
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,780
there's a full digit number and split it

154
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:25,259
and we split it and to get to like the

155
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:28,500
lower sum okay so do we have to try the

156
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,620
three digit and one digit right okay why

157
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,919
because it'll be big it will be big

158
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,900
right three digit you guaranteed it's a

159
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,819
three digit thing once we did this thing

160
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,060
you guarantee there's a hundred right a

161
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,060
hundred

162
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,940
this problem is founded there are only

163
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,960
12. if we try to expect four numbers

164
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:58,080
four digits into uh two digits Plato

165
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,360
digit so it's it's basically the same

166
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,080
thing like four iPods speaking to apples

167
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:07,500
with sequence that's that's p

168
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,960
two apple five for picking two apples is

169
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,599
equals let's pick two apples out of four

170
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,240
apples and then permutate it permutated

171
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,500
okay permutated first of all we pick

172
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,180
like two a plus

173
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,800
and then we can rearrange these two

174
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,539
apples that's basically the way it is

175
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,539
