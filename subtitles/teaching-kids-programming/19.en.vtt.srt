00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,270

hello hello

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,280
hello hello
 

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,550
hello hello
i'm here are there enough enough

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:06,560
i'm here are there enough enough
 

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,750
i'm here are there enough enough
enough enough okay

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:09,760
enough enough okay
 

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,350
enough enough okay
okay so yesterday we talked about the

8
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,360
okay so yesterday we talked about the
 

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,109
okay so yesterday we talked about the
algorithm complexity right oh god

10
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,119
algorithm complexity right oh god
 

11
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,550
algorithm complexity right oh god
yeah so let let's um

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
yeah so let let's um
 

13
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,710
yeah so let let's um
let's just review a little bit okay as a

14
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
let's just review a little bit okay as a
 

15
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,070
let's just review a little bit okay as a
quiz

16
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080
quiz
 

17
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,830
quiz
okay so i have two games i have a

18
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
okay so i have two games i have a
 

19
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,029
okay so i have two games i have a
number yes a list of numbers

20
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
number yes a list of numbers
 

21
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,030
number yes a list of numbers
and i want to compute the sum okay so i

22
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
and i want to compute the sum okay so i
 

23
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,709
and i want to compute the sum okay so i
have two problems what do you have to do

24
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
have two problems what do you have to do
 

25
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,270
have two problems what do you have to do
look don't shake i mean you don't check

26
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,280
look don't shake i mean you don't check
 

27
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,470
look don't shake i mean you don't check
so i have the

28
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
so i have the
 

29
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,310
so i have the
laser function f1 here right

30
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
laser function f1 here right
 

31
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,670
laser function f1 here right
look look and this is number n

32
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
look look and this is number n
 

33
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,310
look look and this is number n
okay and i have a function for

34
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
okay and i have a function for
 

35
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,990
okay and i have a function for
s equals zero i in s

36
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
s equals zero i in s
 

37
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,590
s equals zero i in s
s plus equals i return

38
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
s plus equals i return
 

39
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,750
s plus equals i return
okay

40
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760

 

41
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,910

okay maybe make it this way okay make it

42
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
okay maybe make it this way okay make it
 

43
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,469
okay maybe make it this way okay make it
this way n is a number

44
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
this way n is a number
 

45
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,429
this way n is a number
n is a number like 10 so then i want to

46
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
n is a number like 10 so then i want to
 

47
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,670
n is a number like 10 so then i want to
calculate 1 plus 2 plus 3

48
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
calculate 1 plus 2 plus 3
 

49
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,230
calculate 1 plus 2 plus 3
plus tier 10 okay so let's one way of

50
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
plus tier 10 okay so let's one way of
 

51
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,789
plus tier 10 okay so let's one way of
doing it

52
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
doing it
 

53
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,550
doing it
is is this yeah

54
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
is is this yeah
 

55
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,950
is is this yeah
range m plus one

56
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
range m plus one
 

57
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,230
range m plus one
and plus i okay return s

58
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
and plus i okay return s
 

59
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,990
and plus i okay return s
yeah this is one way or two you need the

60
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
yeah this is one way or two you need the
 

61
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,069
yeah this is one way or two you need the
other way i'll do unit

62
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
other way i'll do unit
 

63
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,109
other way i'll do unit
f2 and i

64
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
f2 and i
 

65
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,390
f2 and i
return n

66
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
return n
 

67
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,710
return n
times m plus 1 divided by 2

68
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
times m plus 1 divided by 2
 

69
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,270
times m plus 1 divided by 2
okay so so this can you tell me which

70
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
okay so so this can you tell me which
 

71
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,910
okay so so this can you tell me which
one is

72
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
one is
 

73
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,109
one is
better there are two both can computer

74
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
better there are two both can computer
 

75
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,149
better there are two both can computer
sum of the first and positive numbers so

76
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
sum of the first and positive numbers so
 

77
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,630
sum of the first and positive numbers so
which one is better

78
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
which one is better
 

79
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,429
which one is better
just take a guess the equivalent

80
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
just take a guess the equivalent
 

81
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,109
just take a guess the equivalent
complexity remember

82
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
complexity remember
 

83
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,830
complexity remember
we talk about that so this is just

84
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
we talk about that so this is just
 

85
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,190
we talk about that so this is just
looping the n numbers

86
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
looping the n numbers
 

87
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,869
looping the n numbers
and then adding each number into the sum

88
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
and then adding each number into the sum
 

89
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,710
and then adding each number into the sum
and this is just using the mathematic

90
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
and this is just using the mathematic
 

91
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,470
and this is just using the mathematic
equation so which one is faster which

92
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
equation so which one is faster which
 

93
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,309
equation so which one is faster which
one is better

94
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
one is better
 

95
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,350
one is better
which one yeah you know the answer yeah

96
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
which one yeah you know the answer yeah
 

97
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,030
which one yeah you know the answer yeah
which one is better

98
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
which one is better
 

99
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,910
which one is better
remember we talked about the linear yeah

100
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
remember we talked about the linear yeah
 

101
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,589
remember we talked about the linear yeah
linear complexity

102
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
linear complexity
 

103
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,869
linear complexity
hmm what do you think come on come on

104
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
hmm what do you think come on come on
 

105
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,390
hmm what do you think come on come on
give me this

106
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:29,400
give me this
 

107
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,710
give me this
interesting okay okay come on come on

108
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720

 

109
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,150

what's

110
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160

 

111
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,030

which one is better just just guess if

112
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
which one is better just just guess if
 

113
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,430
which one is better just just guess if
if

114
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
if
 

115
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,509
if
n is a minion and what this does is

116
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
n is a minion and what this does is
 

117
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,670
n is a minion and what this does is
it needs to iterate the numbers between

118
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
it needs to iterate the numbers between
 

119
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,190
it needs to iterate the numbers between
zero to a minion

120
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
zero to a minion
 

121
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,270
zero to a minion
and adding each number and this one i'm

122
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
and adding each number and this one i'm
 

123
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,830
and adding each number and this one i'm
just putting a minion there

124
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
just putting a minion there
 

125
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,030
just putting a minion there
one million yeah yeah yeah i know and

126
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
one million yeah yeah yeah i know and
 

127
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,630
one million yeah yeah yeah i know and
putting a minion and computer sum so

128
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
putting a minion and computer sum so
 

129
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,630
putting a minion and computer sum so
which one is faster what do you think

130
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
which one is faster what do you think
 

131
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:11,110
which one is faster what do you think
in terms of computers

132
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120

 

133
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,070

yeah you know a hundred times a hundred

134
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
yeah you know a hundred times a hundred
 

135
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,110
yeah you know a hundred times a hundred
plus one

136
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
plus one
 

137
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,750
plus one
divided by two which is gives you 50 50.

138
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
divided by two which is gives you 50 50.
 

139
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,149
divided by two which is gives you 50 50.
right

140
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
right
 

141
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:26,710
right
okay this one is faster

142
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720

 

143
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,630

you don't need to repeat yeah yeah

144
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
you don't need to repeat yeah yeah
 

145
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,750
you don't need to repeat yeah yeah
you're all right yeah

146
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
you're all right yeah
 

147
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,030
you're all right yeah
yeah this is

148
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040

 

149
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,670

this one is a one constant right and if

150
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
this one is a one constant right and if
 

151
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,070
this one is a one constant right and if
you

152
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
you
 

153
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,509
you
draw it on the ball look if you drop

154
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
draw it on the ball look if you drop
 

155
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,789
draw it on the ball look if you drop
joy on here yeah this is n this is t

156
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
joy on here yeah this is n this is t
 

157
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,390
joy on here yeah this is n this is t
so what does it look like this line

158
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
so what does it look like this line
 

159
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,229
so what does it look like this line
all right look at this line water is

160
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
all right look at this line water is
 

161
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,390
all right look at this line water is
okay this is one so the complexity will

162
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
okay this is one so the complexity will
 

163
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,830
okay this is one so the complexity will
be just like that

164
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
be just like that
 

165
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,309
be just like that
yeah yeah that would be just like that

166
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
yeah yeah that would be just like that
 

167
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,070
yeah yeah that would be just like that
it doesn't matter if it's 1 million or

168
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
it doesn't matter if it's 1 million or
 

169
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,149
it doesn't matter if it's 1 million or
10 million right it's always one right

170
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
10 million right it's always one right
 

171
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,990
10 million right it's always one right
but this one is if it's one million it's

172
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
but this one is if it's one million it's
 

173
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,149
but this one is if it's one million it's
very high 10 million is even higher do

174
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
very high 10 million is even higher do
 

175
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,030
very high 10 million is even higher do
you get it

176
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
you get it
 

177
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,190

179
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,670
this is okay well done that's very good
okay so today

180
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
okay so today
 

181
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,630
okay so today
going back to this topic we are going to

182
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
going back to this topic we are going to
 

183
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,789
going back to this topic we are going to
given two list

184
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
given two list
 

185
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,069
given two list
a like one

186
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,079
a like one
 

187
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,510
a like one
three five seven nine

188
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
three five seven nine
 

189
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,629
three five seven nine
and b another list two

190
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
and b another list two
 

191
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,150
and b another list two
for a okay just like that

192
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
for a okay just like that
 

193
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,510
for a okay just like that
so a and b are two two least but they

194
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
so a and b are two two least but they
 

195
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,710
so a and b are two two least but they
are sorted

196
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
are sorted
 

197
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,310
are sorted
yeah look they're sorted so meaning

198
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
yeah look they're sorted so meaning
 

199
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,469
yeah look they're sorted so meaning
each of these is already in order so

200
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
each of these is already in order so
 

201
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,310
each of these is already in order so
look two is smallest two

202
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
look two is smallest two
 

203
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,909
look two is smallest two
is in order right yes one three four

204
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
is in order right yes one three four
 

205
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,590
is in order right yes one three four
is increasing and this is increasing

206
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
is increasing and this is increasing
 

207
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,350
is increasing and this is increasing
yeah so the task

208
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
yeah so the task
 

209
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,909
yeah so the task
is to merge these two you know much

210
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
is to merge these two you know much
 

211
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,110
is to merge these two you know much
much to salty list

212
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120

 

213
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,310

okay so our task is to merge it so

214
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
okay so our task is to merge it so
 

215
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,629
okay so our task is to merge it so
what's the answer here can you tell me

216
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
what's the answer here can you tell me
 

217
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,310
what's the answer here can you tell me
what's the answer

218
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:08,320

 

219
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,110

so look this is one three four five nine

220
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
so look this is one three four five nine
 

221
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,670
so look this is one three four five nine
yeah

222
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
yeah
 

223
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,510
yeah
increasing this is two four eight and i

224
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
increasing this is two four eight and i
 

225
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,749
increasing this is two four eight and i
want to merge it together and

226
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
want to merge it together and
 

227
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,469
want to merge it together and
it will be uh sorted so what does that

228
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
it will be uh sorted so what does that
 

229
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:18,950
it will be uh sorted so what does that
mean

230
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
mean
 

231
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,469
mean
so look one two three four five

232
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
so look one two three four five
 

233
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,350
so look one two three four five
seven eight nine yes

234
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360

 

235
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,390

six okay okay yeah yeah okay

236
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
six okay okay yeah yeah okay
 

237
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,830
six okay okay yeah yeah okay
so the answer would be one

238
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
so the answer would be one
 

239
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,110
so the answer would be one
two three four five

240
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
two three four five
 

241
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,710
two three four five
six seven eight nine okay okay so

242
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
six seven eight nine okay okay so
 

243
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,790
six seven eight nine okay okay so
you basically take every element from

244
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
you basically take every element from
 

245
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,469
you basically take every element from
both and then make it salty do you

246
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
both and then make it salty do you
 

247
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,909
both and then make it salty do you
understand yes

248
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
understand yes
 

249
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,749
understand yes
okay okay so so

250
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
okay okay so so
 

251
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,350
okay okay so so
any source how we do it

252
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
any source how we do it
 

253
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,830
any source how we do it
any thoughts how to resolve it if they

254
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
any thoughts how to resolve it if they
 

255
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,950
any thoughts how to resolve it if they
are both of these

256
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
are both of these
 

257
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,990
are both of these
we take yeah we want to take both

258
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
we take yeah we want to take both
 

259
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,870
we take yeah we want to take both
elements

260
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
elements
 

261
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,790
elements
elements from both leaves and we want to

262
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
elements from both leaves and we want to
 

263
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,550
elements from both leaves and we want to
make it sorted

264
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
make it sorted
 

265
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,029
make it sorted
needs to be sorted as well in order okay

266
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
needs to be sorted as well in order okay
 

267
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,590
needs to be sorted as well in order okay
so one

268
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
so one
 

269
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,670
so one
one easy way will be if i put these this

270
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
one easy way will be if i put these this
 

271
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,070
one easy way will be if i put these this
on to the end or this list onto the end

272
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
on to the end or this list onto the end
 

273
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,950
on to the end or this list onto the end
yeah

274
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
yeah
 

275
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,110
yeah
and then it becomes this but it's not up

276
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
and then it becomes this but it's not up
 

277
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,070
and then it becomes this but it's not up
in order right

278
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
in order right
 

279
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,790
in order right
and then however i saw this entire list

280
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
and then however i saw this entire list
 

281
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,870
and then however i saw this entire list
yeah it worked right

282
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
yeah it worked right
 

283
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,550
yeah it worked right
yeah so how do we do it using the

284
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
yeah so how do we do it using the
 

285
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,990
yeah so how do we do it using the
define merge okay

286
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000

 

287
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,430

much a yeah look comma b

288
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
much a yeah look comma b
 

289
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,469
much a yeah look comma b
what's this column

290
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
what's this column
 

291
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,189
what's this column
and then look if i see yeah c is at

292
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
and then look if i see yeah c is at
 

293
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,830
and then look if i see yeah c is at
least if i do it a plus b

294
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
least if i do it a plus b
 

295
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,790
least if i do it a plus b
then you please list here this list will

296
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
then you please list here this list will
 

297
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,029
then you please list here this list will
become 13579

298
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
become 13579
 

299

so eric
 

305
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,629
so eric
can you remind me what do we do to sort

306
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
can you remind me what do we do to sort
 

307
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,830
can you remind me what do we do to sort

it
c dot source yeah

310
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
c dot source yeah
 

311
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,790
c dot source yeah
and that's it return c i can't see

312
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
and that's it return c i can't see
 

313
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,270
and that's it return c i can't see
okay this is one way or two here it's

314
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
okay this is one way or two here it's
 

315
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,550
okay this is one way or two here it's
quick right

316

317
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,749

yeah a balancing will become this yeah

318
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
yeah a balancing will become this yeah
 

319
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,350
yeah a balancing will become this yeah
one three five seven nine and 2 4 6 8.

320
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
one three five seven nine and 2 4 6 8.
 

321
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,749
one three five seven nine and 2 4 6 8.
this a big this c would become this list

322
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
this a big this c would become this list
 

323
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,909
this a big this c would become this list
and i sort it and it will become this

324
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
and i sort it and it will become this
 

325
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,189
and i sort it and it will become this
another return c yes yes okay but this

326
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
another return c yes yes okay but this
 

327
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,629
another return c yes yes okay but this
is

328
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
is
 

329
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,469
is
so this if all right

so this if all right
yes if the size of this is big a the

332
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
yes if the size of this is big a the
 

333
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,230
yes if the size of this is big a the
size of this is big

334
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
size of this is big
 

335
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,270
size of this is big
eight big b so let's in high c

336
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
eight big b so let's in high c
 

337
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,270
eight big b so let's in high c
yeah the c the size of c is what

338
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
yeah the c the size of c is what
 

339
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,790
yeah the c the size of c is what
a plus b so the c is a plus b

340
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
a plus b so the c is a plus b
 

341
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,270
a plus b so the c is a plus b
yes exactly and the sorting algorithm

342
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
yes exactly and the sorting algorithm
 

343
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,270
yes exactly and the sorting algorithm
generally takes

344
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
generally takes
 

345
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,670
generally takes
big o remember we talk about we go this

346
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
big o remember we talk about we go this
 

347
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,430
big o remember we talk about we go this
the complexity of this is

348
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
the complexity of this is
 

349
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,469
the complexity of this is
o and log n right if there are any

350
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:56,479
o and log n right if there are any
 

351
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,029
o and log n right if there are any
elements if we want to sort this with

352
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
elements if we want to sort this with
 

353
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,830
elements if we want to sort this with
an element this is complexity so this

354
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
an element this is complexity so this
 

355
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,350
an element this is complexity so this
will be oc

356
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
will be oc
 

357
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,029
will be oc
log c where c is a plus b okay

358
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
log c where c is a plus b okay
 

359
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,309
log c where c is a plus b okay
this is the one way of doing now we can

360
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
this is the one way of doing now we can
 

361
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,150
this is the one way of doing now we can
we have a better way of doing it because

362
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
we have a better way of doing it because
 

363
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,390
we have a better way of doing it because
these two leaves are slotted okay

364
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
these two leaves are slotted okay
 

365
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,830
these two leaves are slotted okay
these two lists are sorted

366
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840

 

367
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,869

so how about look how about

368
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
so how about look how about
 

369
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,270
so how about look how about
i want to see here yeah i want to see

370
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
i want to see here yeah i want to see
 

371
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,790
i want to see here yeah i want to see
here how about i have

372
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
here how about i have
 

373
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,869
here how about i have
i

374
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879

 

375
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,509

i have two hand left hand here right

376
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
i have two hand left hand here right
 

377
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,949
i have two hand left hand here right
hand here okay

378
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
hand here okay
 

379
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,949
hand here okay
okay so i compare is one smaller than

380
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
okay so i compare is one smaller than
 

381
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,070
okay so i compare is one smaller than
two

382
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
two
 

383
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,110
two
uh yes okay i'll put a smaller one

384
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
uh yes okay i'll put a smaller one
 

385
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,469
uh yes okay i'll put a smaller one
that's one here right

386
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
that's one here right
 

387
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,870
that's one here right
yeah yeah and i move this left hand

388
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
yeah yeah and i move this left hand
 

389
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,670
yeah yeah and i move this left hand
there okay

390
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
there okay
 

391
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,350
there okay
yeah is three smaller than two no

392
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
yeah is three smaller than two no
 

393
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,829
yeah is three smaller than two no
it's two smaller than three right yes i

394
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
it's two smaller than three right yes i
 

395
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,190
it's two smaller than three right yes i
always put a smaller one

396
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
always put a smaller one
 

397
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,070
always put a smaller one
here or two and i'll move this to here

398
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
here or two and i'll move this to here
 

399
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,590
here or two and i'll move this to here
right two hands yeah

400
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
right two hands yeah
 

401
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,790
right two hands yeah
three and four three smaller yes we have

402
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
three and four three smaller yes we have
 

403
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,310
three and four three smaller yes we have
smaller so i put a three here

404
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
smaller so i put a three here
 

405
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,550
smaller so i put a three here
and i move the three to five do you get

406
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
and i move the three to five do you get
 

407
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,670
and i move the three to five do you get
it

408
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
it
 

409
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,790
it
yeah and then five and four

410
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
yeah and then five and four
 

411
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,269
yeah and then five and four
four is small four is smaller right so i

412
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
four is small four is smaller right so i
 

413
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,949
four is small four is smaller right so i
put a four here and i'm moving

414
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
put a four here and i'm moving
 

415
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,430
put a four here and i'm moving
do you see it so i have two hands which

416
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
do you see it so i have two hands which
 

417
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,110
do you see it so i have two hands which
hand is smaller i always put a smaller

418
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
hand is smaller i always put a smaller
 

419
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,550
hand is smaller i always put a smaller
hand and move that thing

420
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
hand and move that thing
 

421
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,350
hand and move that thing
until it reaches the end yeah this is it

422
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
until it reaches the end yeah this is it
 

423
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,509
until it reaches the end yeah this is it
because it's already sorted and i can do

424
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
because it's already sorted and i can do
 

425
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,230
because it's already sorted and i can do
this

426
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
this
 

427
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,910
this
yeah there you see it because every time

428
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
yeah there you see it because every time
 

429
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,590
yeah there you see it because every time
i left hand and right hand

430
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
i left hand and right hand
 

431
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,990
i left hand and right hand
they're both pointing to the smallest

432
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
they're both pointing to the smallest
 

433
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,350
they're both pointing to the smallest
element in their list

434
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
element in their list
 

435
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,670
element in their list
am right do you get it if one is the

436
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
am right do you get it if one is the
 

437
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,350
am right do you get it if one is the
smallest of this

438
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
smallest of this
 

439
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,670
smallest of this
b is not small a two is smallest in this

440
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
b is not small a two is smallest in this
 

441
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,470
b is not small a two is smallest in this
right

442
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
right
 

443
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,550
right
yes then i compare one and two

444
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
yes then i compare one and two
 

445
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,389
yes then i compare one and two
one is smaller than two so means that

446
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
one is smaller than two so means that
 

447
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,230
one is smaller than two so means that
the next number should be one right

448
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
the next number should be one right
 

449
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,829
the next number should be one right
so the length could be in order yeah

450
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
so the length could be in order yeah
 

451
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,710
so the length could be in order yeah
yeah it should be in order yes

452
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
yeah it should be in order yes
 

453
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,430
yeah it should be in order yes
okay so we can do this

454
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440

 

455
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,470

define what happens if they're the same

456
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
define what happens if they're the same
 

457
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,190
define what happens if they're the same
number

458
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
number
 

459
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,389
number
what do you miss a number in each list

460
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
what do you miss a number in each list
 

461
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,030
what do you miss a number in each list
if oh there are two numbers the same

462
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
if oh there are two numbers the same
 

463
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,310
if oh there are two numbers the same
yeah if i fall here

464
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
yeah if i fall here
 

465
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,630
yeah if i fall here
it doesn't matter if it's not smaller

466
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
it doesn't matter if it's not smaller
 

467
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,790
it doesn't matter if it's not smaller
you can pick any one if it's the same

468
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
you can pick any one if it's the same
 

469
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,630
you can pick any one if it's the same
you pick any one yeah and you move it

470
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
you pick any one yeah and you move it
 

471
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,389
you pick any one yeah and you move it
it also works right define

472
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
it also works right define
 

473
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,150
it also works right define
good question by the way that's a very

474
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
good question by the way that's a very
 

475
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,590
good question by the way that's a very
good question

476
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
good question
 

477
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,910
good question
merge a b y

478
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
merge a b y
 

479
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,269
merge a b y
okay so now we we we have a c

480
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
okay so now we we we have a c
 

481
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,230
okay so now we we we have a c
c equals the empty at the beginning

482
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
c equals the empty at the beginning
 

483
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,110
c equals the empty at the beginning
right

484
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
right
 

485
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,710
right
okay now we need to i j

486
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
okay now we need to i j
 

487
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,150
okay now we need to i j
l a l b these four variables i j

488
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
l a l b these four variables i j
 

489
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,509
l a l b these four variables i j
will be the beginning 0 0 0 0 means the

490
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
will be the beginning 0 0 0 0 means the
 

491
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,590
will be the beginning 0 0 0 0 means the
first animal yeah

492
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
first animal yeah
 

493
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,949
first animal yeah
is length a

494
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
is length a
 

495
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,590
is length a
and means b so i want to get the size of

496
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
and means b so i want to get the size of
 

497
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,710
and means b so i want to get the size of
both yeah

498
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
both yeah
 

499
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,389
both yeah
and then i need what i need to do y

500
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:56,399
and then i need what i need to do y
 

501
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,230
and then i need what i need to do y
i smaller than air a

502
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
i smaller than air a
 

503
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,750
i smaller than air a
and j smaller than

504
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
and j smaller than
 

505
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,110
and j smaller than
air b so when these two pointers are not

506
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
air b so when these two pointers are not
 

507
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,430
air b so when these two pointers are not
going to the end right and i need to

508
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
going to the end right and i need to
 

509
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,430
going to the end right and i need to
compare if

510
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
compare if
 

511
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,630
compare if
a i look if a i defend

512
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
a i look if a i defend
 

513
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,790
a i look if a i defend
is smaller than b j right

514
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
is smaller than b j right
 

515
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,069
is smaller than b j right
then i need to put put this number

516
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079
then i need to put put this number
 

517
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,750
then i need to put put this number
c dot append

518
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
c dot append
 

519
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,269
c dot append
or we can do it do this c plus equals

520
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
or we can do it do this c plus equals
 

521
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,190
or we can do it do this c plus equals
plus a i right so we put this

522
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
plus a i right so we put this
 

523
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,470
plus a i right so we put this
one there and then i plus equals one

524
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
one there and then i plus equals one
 

525
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,550
one there and then i plus equals one
and move this left otherwise

526
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
and move this left otherwise
 

527
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,790
and move this left otherwise
otherwise you'll be a i will be bigger

528
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
otherwise you'll be a i will be bigger
 

529
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,670
otherwise you'll be a i will be bigger
than bj

530
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
than bj
 

531
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,710
than bj
now we need to to put these b

532
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,720
now we need to to put these b
 

533
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,230
now we need to to put these b
numbers bj number there and then j

534
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
numbers bj number there and then j
 

535
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,269
numbers bj number there and then j
plus equals one okay now but

536
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
plus equals one okay now but
 

537
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,509
plus equals one okay now but
do you have any return no yeah no yeah

538
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
do you have any return no yeah no yeah
 

539
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,790
do you have any return no yeah no yeah
no yeah so

540
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
no yeah so
 

541
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,829
no yeah so
the problem is that look this is n so if

542
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
the problem is that look this is n so if
 

543
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,590
the problem is that look this is n so if
the length one is bigger

544
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
the length one is bigger
 

545
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,990
the length one is bigger
one is longer the other is smaller right

546
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
one is longer the other is smaller right
 

547
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,629
one is longer the other is smaller right
so this

548
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
so this
 

549
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,069
so this
j will apparently may reach here faster

550
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
j will apparently may reach here faster
 

551
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,069
j will apparently may reach here faster
than this blue will end right so we need

552
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
than this blue will end right so we need
 

553
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,230
than this blue will end right so we need
to check

554
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
to check
 

555
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,230
to check
we need to check if there are remaining

556
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
we need to check if there are remaining
 

557
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,310
we need to check if there are remaining
items in both lists so we can do this by

558
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
items in both lists so we can do this by
 

559
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,590
items in both lists so we can do this by
we can do this by y

560
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
we can do this by y
 

561
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,069
we can do this by y
go go this way okay y whatever

562
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
go go this way okay y whatever
 

563
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,110
go go this way okay y whatever
why i smaller than aira if it's still

564
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
why i smaller than aira if it's still
 

565
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,710
why i smaller than aira if it's still
there anymore there then i need to

pushing these elements to the end
 

571
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,069
pushing these elements to the end

what's the the last bit
you can guess which number is it

586
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
you can guess which number is it

what are we doing in order to return the
 

591
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,590
what are we doing in order to return the

take a guess
 

599
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,710
take a guess
look what what we are doing here what

600
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
look what what we are doing here what
 

601
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,670
look what what we are doing here what
are we doing here

602
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
are we doing here
 

603
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,389
are we doing here
we are trying to put the element put the

604
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
we are trying to put the element put the
 

605
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,870
we are trying to put the element put the
next

606
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
next
 

607
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,430
next
smallest element

608
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440

 

609
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,710

which is that l

610
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
which is that l
 

611
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,829
which is that l
or c why

612
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
or c why
 

613
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,430
or c why
why why i smaller y c

614
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
why why i smaller y c
 

615
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,949
why why i smaller y c
c yeah yeah because it's c yeah

616
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:44,959
c yeah yeah because it's c yeah
 

617
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,150
c yeah yeah because it's c yeah
yeah you see so uh just

618
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
yeah you see so uh just
 

619
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,389
yeah you see so uh just
take so this complexity will be just

620
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:52,399
take so this complexity will be just
 

621
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,110
take so this complexity will be just
n plus a plus b yeah you see this

622
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
n plus a plus b yeah you see this
 

623
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,870
n plus a plus b yeah you see this
complexity is a plus b

624
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
complexity is a plus b
 

625
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,990
complexity is a plus b
why because i have two two pointers my

626
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
why because i have two two pointers my
 

627
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,310
why because i have two two pointers my
job is movement to the end

628
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
job is movement to the end
 

629
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,389
job is movement to the end
and just one scan that will be a plus b

630
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
and just one scan that will be a plus b
 

631
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,790
and just one scan that will be a plus b
right yeah so it's faster yeah

632
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
right yeah so it's faster yeah
 

633
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,590
right yeah so it's faster yeah
it's a bit faster than than previously

634
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
it's a bit faster than than previously
 

635
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,910
it's a bit faster than than previously
it's oc right it's basically on c

636
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
it's oc right it's basically on c
 

637
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,829
it's oc right it's basically on c
remember remember the previous one is

638
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839
remember remember the previous one is
 

639
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,310
remember remember the previous one is
one

640
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:17,320
one
 

641
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,230
one
[Music]

642
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240

 

643
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,069

so which is faster which is faster

644
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
so which is faster which is faster
 

645
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,069
so which is faster which is faster
yeah which one this one yeah of course

646
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
yeah which one this one yeah of course
 

647
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,189
yeah which one this one yeah of course
so uh yeah of course the oc

648
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
so uh yeah of course the oc
 

649
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,230
so uh yeah of course the oc
is faster yeah because only uh

650
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
is faster yeah because only uh
 

651
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,269
is faster yeah because only uh
oc oc is

652
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
oc oc is
 

653
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,829
oc oc is
oc is this one and o oc local c

yes any questions
 

661
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,790
yes any questions
no really okay so i'm going to
