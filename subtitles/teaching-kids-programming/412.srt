1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,960
hello hello hello guys hello hi

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,720
okay so today we're going to talk about

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,280
probability yeah what's the probability

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,200
probability and probability

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,360
you're going to get thingy percentage

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,440
yeah we're down percentage so it's

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,840
basically the

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,439
the number of times that one even occurs

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,359
yeah so you basically the number of

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,160
times

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,720
an even occurs yeah

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,279
event occurs so yeah divided by okay i'm

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,199
gonna divide it by total number of even

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,200
yeah something very roughly okay for

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,000
example like uh

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,239
uh so if you flip if you flip a coin

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
what's the probability of the coin being

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,079
the text

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,039
um

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,039
50 yeah because fifty percent so there

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,160
are the total number of events that

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,440
could be

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,440
what

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,879
so how many possibilities are there that

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,120
two right so one the coins being tail uh

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,559
heads is fifty percent one of it one of

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,559
two okay

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,640
okay so the dice yeah we're going to

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,520
roll the dice so how many possibilities

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,520
of rolling a dice

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,880
how many six yes and how many the

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,880
percentage of rolling a six

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,040
dice and roll it twice uh two times

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,960
what's the problem

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,840
well okay so

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,240
yeah yeah one is basically one over six

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,240
times one over six yeah times one over

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,240
six so rolling or two six at a time and

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,840
how about if i had to wrote it one more

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,200
time like uh rho is three times what's

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,720
the probability of being uh three sixths

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,720
in a row

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,600
what's the probability of being a 360 in

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,840
a row come on um

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,240
216. yeah wow you're quick a mess yeah

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,720
so basically okay

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,680
okay so basically you times one over six

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,920
power to three yeah okay so now so

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,920
listen

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,479
yeah now listen listen up uh so what's

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
the probability of rolling three dice

52
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,960
but at least there are two six in a row

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,159
so you'll be something like six six

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,200
something

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,879
okay or something six six oh

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,879
yeah okay

57
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,760
okay so now this question mark here okay

58
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,360
this question mark here is not six not

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,040
being six okay so what if i wrote a dice

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,760
and then what's the probability of it

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,560
not being six

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,360
five

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,000
y five over six yeah exactly because

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,120
one over six is the being six and one

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,080
minus one over six so basically this is

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,040
one minus one over six yeah yeah easy

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
okay so

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,280
yeah so we just have to add up these

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,239
three odds yeah three odds yeah so

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
what's the probability so what

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,280
look

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,239
are these two the same the probability

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
of being

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,200
something 6 six or six six something

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,680
yeah okay so we what's the probability

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,720
of going to six the first six seconds

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,959
six

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,080
as we say one over six times one over

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,120
six yeah

80
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,120
yeah

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
yeah and then what's the probability the

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,360
third one not being six

83
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,959
um

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,480
okay and then look at this one is the

85
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,560
same yeah this one is

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,560
the second one yeah because yeah all

87
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,959
right the odds of

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,800
the second and the third one being six

89
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,640
is the same yeah as the first one and

90
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,000
the second one six all right what's the

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,879
probability of triple six three six yeah

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,840
times that like bad right yeah

93
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,360
okay

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,440
yeah got it

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,319
i know what's the probability of rolling

96
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,159
a 2 6 in a row or rolling the 260 yeah

97
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,760
in a row so it's adding these together

98
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,599
yeah yeah i'm right all right

99
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,000
make sense so let's see what's the

100
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,840
probability of

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,920
the

102
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,959
print yeah print okay so we just have

103
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,319
two

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,519
this one yeah

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,840
this one

106
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
adds this one okay in times two

107
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,879
and as this one yeah

108
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
okay

109
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,200
all right

110
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,519
okay so let's see okay so this is the

111
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,319
probability roughly five percent five

112
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,239
percent three and ends with two and the

113
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,599
two okay okay now

114
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,239
it's a long one yeah that ends up two

115
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,439
this okay so this digit you know it's

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,840
it's uh

117
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,079
it's so small so tiny so so trivial yeah

118
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,320
so trivial okay so that we can prove

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,479
this we can prove this accuracy using

120
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,520
the blue force first basically we just

121
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,400
simulate rolling the dices so for the

122
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,880
first one

123
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,040
in range one to seven right because

124
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,880
there's six possibilities if we roll the

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,199
first one then we can control the second

126
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,759
one in range again one two six one two

127
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,320
seven yeah because one to six you know

128
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,639
yeah why the last why this parameter is

129
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,600
seven do you still recall

130
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,600
the range function

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,000
yeah so it's up to seven not including

132
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
yeah

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,199
okay for third in range one seven the

134
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,120
third digit okay now we just have to to

135
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,639
check all right if

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,560
first

137
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,320
equals second

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,120
equals six right

139
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,160
i think this is can you find that

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,000
or

141
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,199
second

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,520
equals

143
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,759
i'm not sure can we if we can we can we

144
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,240
write this like that okay so then we

145
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,840
have this event even uh

146
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,479
just two six

147
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,560
uh two six

148
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,960
plus equal one okay

149
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,880
what's the total number of uh you know

150
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,400
possibilities

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,639
do you still recall

152
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,000
knowing three three dies at a time

153
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,000
what's the total number of possibilities

154
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,680
okay so it's one time six times six

155
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
times six yeah so basically we just want

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,560
to

157
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
print the two six

158
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,080
yeah because this is two six divided by

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,080
total right

160
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,080
okay so let's see if this is the same

161
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,319
okay

162
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,080
uh 2 6 is not defined yeah we have to

163
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,800
define it because at the beginning this

164
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,479
is zero yeah yeah am i right

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,479
okay so look it's the same yeah first

166
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,319
equal second is the same okay

167
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
is it the same yeah it's the same yeah

168
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,960
you see it's the same again it's right

169
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,039
now yeah yeah it's the same okay

170
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,440
yeah it's the same yeah okay so what's

171
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,440
the time complexity of race one

172
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,880
for this one that's a very trick one

173
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,360
what's the come back time coming back to

174
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,160
the other oh six times six times six

175
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,319
six seven six times next whether oh six

176
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,120
times six times six so we don't say that

177
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,000
so which is what

178
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,680
okay

179
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
no no no there's no n here what's wrong

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,520
there's no cubic oh one cubic is one

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,360
yeah

182
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,120
yeah or one times one time one can

183
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,520
become because it's constant why why is

184
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,160
that because the problem is fixed we are

185
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,039
rolling three dices that's it you can't

186
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,199
scale

187
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,400
up okay so let's yeah because it's

188
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,319
simple

189
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,599
it's a simple math well that's a simple

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,039
matter

191
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,000
yeah look at this

192
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,639
two

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,479
because look we are just iterating

194
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,840
the total number

195
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,240
okay look

196
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,280
that we are iterating this total number

197
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,039
of times which is 216 yeah yeah we're

198
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,039
just iterating that

199
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,680
number of uh loops yeah

200
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,160
so that's the number of iterations that

201
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,120
these piece of curve runs so it's all

202
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,160
one it's it's fixed there's no n right

203
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,000
so it's constant it's constant okay so

204
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,000
we we can make this problem a little bit

205
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,360
more interesting like rolling uh and

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,319
dices right not freedom allowing

207
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,639
analysis to to find out the probability

208
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,240
of being two to six interval okay so

209
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,479
that's too complicated for today now

210
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,800
we're going to deep dive later in the

211
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,639
future right so in that case we will

212
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
introduce the uh

213
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,879
variable which is n right n is the

214
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,479
number of dices do you understand yeah

215
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,080
yes do you understand

216
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,960
yeah

217
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,810
okay so let that be for today good job

218
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,050
guys say bye bye

219
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,050
