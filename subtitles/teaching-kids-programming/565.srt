1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,599
yeah okay so we know the string right so

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:14,160
string like uh hello this is string

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,480
hello Eric and Ryan okay so look this is

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,440
a string s

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,140
so just guess what's the output as the

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,279
find e f

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:31,140
s Define

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:33,960
A and D okay so what's the output k h e

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,620
i okay so what does this mean just guess

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,200
if it is

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:43,860
yeah I think you written through the 10

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,960
true okay quite close and you can't find

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,879
it because it's Capital that's right

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,399
yeah let's go find it okay so this is

15
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,379
fine obviously we're trying to find so

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,879
we are trying to find a substring right

17
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,239
substring

18
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,940
to see if it's in the original screen so

19
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,000
this is like pattern this is a string so

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,240
if we find it when we turn the index the

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,159
index here is zero one index one it

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,680
finds it so it returns

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,600
one but you can't find it yeah that's a

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,020
good point if you can't find it returns

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,020
minus one okay so another example as to

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,080
find what what if the string is nothing

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,479
nothing that's a good point if you find

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,939
nothing in return zero okay so you

29
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,820
assume nothing is a you know always

30
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,860
found okay this is a substring it can

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,080
contain the more than one character how

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,299
about index

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,860
how about if I replace the fight with

34
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,420
the index

35
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,340
the difference we didn't find anything

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,100
what's the index

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,119
what does it mean in that it's basically

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:51,360
like you in the book of my non-fiction

39
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,220
and you go to the page about are things

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,259
like indexes

41
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,420
are they like value

42
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,119
true okay so find an index is quite

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,220
similar right so what's fine you try to

44
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,479
find the index right okay so when you

45
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,219
say it's fine

46
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,899
are you sure you're going to find it or

47
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,819
not

48
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,340
now that's why we have minus one right

49
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,420
but when you say index it's there right

50
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,040
yeah

51
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,500
yeah okay so normally difference between

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,580
find the indexes like when the item is

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
not filed

54
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,440
when the item is not found gonna find

55
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,660
returns minus one the index will return

56
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,940
a value error

57
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,920
value error this is an exception all

58
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,739
right that's the only difference that's

59
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,560
for the string and if this is a list

60
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,739
okay if it is like

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,379
you know at least one two three four

62
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,420
okay this is list and then you can do

63
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,860
list of index

64
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,080
okay index two what is it return

65
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,760
one two three four this is this index

66
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,580
two what is a great time it could be the

67
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,760
chapter what does it return

68
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,760
s two

69
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,720
why is this three two zero is zero zero

70
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,040
one two three so index two what is it

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,760
written three

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,819
three why is this way because three

73
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,140
three zero one one two index two we're

74
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:18,500
on to five two

75
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,500
oh one yeah zero one yes okay okay

76
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,680
the place then you use this person right

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,720
you finish this two then zero one two

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,440
and return three okay this is the how we

79
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,920
index find the cutter find the element

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,580
at index two for a tuple array on this

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,620
or whatever and if this is like a five

82
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,659
then you will throw the arrow right so

83
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,360
this value error because the index but

84
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:47,519
for at least it doesn't have a finite

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,260
function as I said find

86
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,519
three times minus one if it's the

87
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,480
element it's not found index

88
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,299
Returns the

89
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,900
value error this is exception so raise

90
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,819
this is basically raised very well it's

91
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,220
an expression what's extension it's

92
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,459
basically like computer screaming okay

93
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,220
so you you ask computer okay what's the

94
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,379
index of elements I in this list the

95
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,260
computer just screen because I don't

96
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:19,139
have it you are trying to you're trying

97
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,880
to ask me for the index I can't do it

98
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,300
right but if it's fine it's different

99
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,180
you ask me is there a element five in

100
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,100
this list right you're asking like a

101
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,139
more gentle way and I said okay I don't

102
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,139
have it but I return you minus one okay

103
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:37,500
yeah this is the difference you're

104
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,840
asking if if he does have a size then

105
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,479
you're telling the computer to do

106
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,600
something with five even when he doesn't

107
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,280
have it yeah yeah true too yeah okay so

108
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,540
given the least how do we find the

109
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,580
element

110
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,220
what's the strategy how do we find the

111
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,280
element in the array

112
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,740
we look real way how do we look for you

113
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,960
what's the strategy

114
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,100
you know one two three four I give it

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,100
away

116
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,860
you know one two three

117
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,419
I want to fight like the nine right now

118
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,979
it could be here so how do we find it

119
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,199
how do we ask computer level how does

120
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:15,419
the computer find this Knight try to

121
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,060
find locate where is the nice return the

122
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,600
index okay

123
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,800
sorry left and right this is

124
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,320
if there are any elements what's the

125
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,460
time cameras

126
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,460
in the worst case what happened

127
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,380
or not in

128
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,720
that or if it's not in the array then

129
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,280
the computer needs to you know go

130
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
through all the elements in the right in

131
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,479
the efficient okay

132
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,520
okay if they already sorted how do we go

133
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,620
through it how do we search it

134
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,139
if it's in the array it's okay like one

135
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:54,060
two three to a hundred I want to locate

136
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:57,419
if like the number 30 how do we do it

137
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,240
you can't do it like yeah what does it

138
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,720
call binary binary watch binary size

139
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,699
what's the time research

140
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,440
okay that's good yeah overlooking yeah

141
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,699
because every time we cut in her life if

142
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,400
it's smaller

143
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,960
yeah if the animal is in this half we

144
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,500
don't need to search any of those right

145
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,560
so we abandon every time we abandon half

146
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:25,340
of the search domain okay okay so let's

147
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,340
Implement a fine function for the list

148
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,780
40 what do you mean okay

149
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:39,240
the first element is 14. okay 40 50. it

150
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,220
doesn't matter right yeah

151
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,500
yeah when we say look in the meter we're

152
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,680
not saying the value meter we're saying

153
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,680
that the meter of the array right so let

154
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,440
me tell it could be 100 or 300 let's put

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,380
another element it doesn't matter like

156
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,240
okay so the meter is this one okay so we

157
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,360
compare with this one 30 is smaller than

158
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:04,080
that right yeah so we don't need to

159
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,660
do any of this what is it what's the

160
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,039
middle is two numbers like before it

161
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,560
doesn't matter you can pick any one it

162
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,539
doesn't matter right because that's just

163
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,340
one difference this makes sense you need

164
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:17,100
this half I don't need to search any of

165
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,080
those and then here again it's smaller

166
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,580
than that I go into here and it's

167
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,759
smaller than that okay well right now of

168
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,220
choice is a minus one okay so as I said

169
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,960
let's Implement a fight using the linear

170
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,060
search okay because the away income

171
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,120
issue is salted python doesn't have a

172
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,099
file for the list okay and before I

173
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,680
forgot the index function right index

174
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,259
function and the fight function the

175
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,380
first element is the Target and then

176
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,960
there are options so you can start an n

177
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,240
and the range so let's say we don't want

178
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,940
to search the entire list let's say we

179
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,620
want to start from the index 2 to index

180
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,419
five then we can put the two and five

181
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,419
here does it make sense this is optional

182
00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:02,699
parameters right you can give a star and

183
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:04,800
get the n yeah yeah okay Define five

184
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,259
we want to fight for a list all right

185
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,880
not iterable all right okay let's make

186
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,000
it all right and we want to find a

187
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,919
Target and an optional s and n if we

188
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,520
don't give a star parameter the optional

189
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,460
it's it's yellow and if we don't give a

190
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,460
optional that's minus one okay I can set

191
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,520
a default value for the parameters

192
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,800
if you don't give a value for S it's

193
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,580
zero if you don't give a value for e is

194
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,560
minus one if e is is minus one then we

195
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,800
need to correct it to the length of the

196
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,580
T right if we don't give a parameters

197
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:46,200
for the end boundary we set it to the

198
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:48,540
end of the the list each rows for I in

199
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,459
range from the start to the end and

200
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,459
we'll just check if a r i

201
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,360
minus one

202
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,519
okay so if we decide to sew an exception

203
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:13,320
we just replace this return with raise

204
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,779
a message here we can use the next

205
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:22,220
function right so we can say answer

206
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:24,600
equals next I for I in range

207
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:29,760
s e

208
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:32,459
e a r r i equal equal t

209
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,980
otherwise we return minus one if you not

210
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:39,060
fuck and then we can answer or if answer

211
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:41,279
equal equal minus one then we raise the

212
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,380
exception raise variable if we are

213
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,540
implementing the index function if it's

214
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,880
a five function which is written minus

215
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,380
one right so return answer

216
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,019
okay

217
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,260
okay so look this is the five function

218
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,180
for a list we can pass the at least a

219
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:01,380
chapter right so how do we use this

220
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:04,320
function five at least one two three all

221
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,440
one two three and then we want to find

222
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,200
the target three and look that's it if

223
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,779
we don't specify the S and E star and N

224
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,660
the S will be zero e will be minus one

225
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,940
but when e is minus one e will be uh

226
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,440
corrected to the length of the given

227
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,470
parameter right okay so what have you

228
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,839
learned today

229
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,060
[Music]

230
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,560
find an index right what's the

231
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,560
difference between find and index

232
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,360
yeah what's the difference between final

233
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:39,360
index okay

234
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:43,019
um index is your brain you can you try

235
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,200
to find like the like Place whatever

236
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,180
it's called

237
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,120
and and for the find the original

238
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,820
finding for it okay so what's the

239
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,200
difference the difference is it is not

240
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,560
there yeah

241
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:02,820
because if you're finding it it could be

242
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,760
there or not there before index and for

243
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,839
index you're you're telling something

244
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:13,459
you're telling me to do something within

245
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:17,220
elements but if that element isn't that

246
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:19,860
uh is a problem it's a problem the way

247
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,380
it's a very exception okay and the final

248
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,019
will be 10 minus one if it's not there

249
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,420
okay yeah you're trying to find

250
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,760
something you could be now you could not

251
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,500
be there it could be not existent right

252
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,839
but for the index you're pretty sure

253
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,040
it's there that's why you're asked to

254
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,740
find the index

255
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,000
when you say okay give me the index of

256
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,640
element

257
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,839
are you sure like it's there right and

258
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,640
if it's not that and it's going to be

259
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,620
perfect but it's like find me in the

260
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,019
index and it could could be the case

261
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,180
that it's not that right okay and now we

262
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:53,279
use the linear search we just do this

263
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,040
from a search start to the end and

264
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,839
finally we try to check each element to

265
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,240
see if it's equals to that right also

266
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,120
the find the index suppose the option

267
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,519
the parameter so so we can given range

268
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,800
from s to e we want to find a different

269
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,100
P okay so for example the last question

270
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,839
okay s top five

271
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,779
Eric

272
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,300
and Ryan okay

273
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:22,140
and I'm give a parameter

274
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,360
0 to 2 what does it return

275
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,279
pause

276
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,440
minus one y is minus one because there

277
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:31,740
is

278
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,839
yeah zero and one two so he's basically

279
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,760
trying to find it here and

280
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,399
everything

281
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,160
that has more values at than two true

282
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,620
yes true yeah okay yeah this is a simple

283
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,240
way to check right simple way to check

284
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,680
but what's underneath how do we

285
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,940
implement this this is a very

286
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,980
complicated topic it is called KMP you

287
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,440
know substring matching okay this is out

288
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,180
of scope of this talk yeah probably in

289
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,500
the future we can come back to this okay

290
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:04,160
that's it for today bye-bye bye bye

291
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,160
foreign
